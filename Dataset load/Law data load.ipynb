The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items.

There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments.

At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement.

      "['02-1472 ', ' 287 ', ' TRUE ', ' JUSTICE GINSBURG ', ' JUSTICE ', ' PETITIONER ', ' RESPONDENT ', ' Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?']\n",
      "['02-1472 ', ' 288 ', ' TRUE ', ' MR. SRINIVASAN ', ' NOT JUSTICE ', ' NA ', ' RESPONDENT ', \" I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.

      "['02-1472 ', ' 293 ', ' TRUE ', ' MR. MILLER ', ' NOT JUSTICE ', ' NA ', ' PETITIONER ', \" Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.\"]\n",

At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.\"]\n",

      "['02-1472 ', ' 288 ', ' TRUE ', ' MR. SRINIVASAN ', ' NOT JUSTICE ', ' NA ', ' RESPONDENT ', \" I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.

      "['02-1472 ', ' 293 ', ' TRUE ', ' MR. MILLER ', ' NOT JUSTICE ', ' NA ', ' PETITIONER ', \" Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.\"]\n",
