ever since i remember ,
i have loved airplane and flying .
i am now in college with a private pilot 's license
and looking to become a commercial .
i could never remember
why i was so obsessed with the subject
until i came across my old tail spin tape in my basement at home
and it hit me ,
this was it .
my parent bought every single tape
they had
and this was the only show i would watch as a kid .
i had the theme memorized
as i grew up
and i can still re-cite it today .
it is absolutely amazing and i plan
on buying the dvd 's soon !
it really is great for child and adult
and is absolutely timeless .
i can not get enough of this show .
