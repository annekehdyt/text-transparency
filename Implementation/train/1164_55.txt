who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i. gordon 's legendary bad trash-film `` food of the god '' ?
nobody 
of course 
but director damien lee thought
it was a good idea 
anyway ,
and he put together a belated sequel
that stands as one of the most redundant movie in horror history .
`` gnaw '' is a sequel in name only ,
as the setting moved to a typical late 80 's location
( a university campus )
and also the cheap and cheesy gore effect perfectly illustrates the 80 's .
this script hangs together by clich\u00e9s 
awfully written dialog and plot situation
that are not so subtly stolen from other ( and more successful )
horror classic .
neil hamilton is a goody two shoe scientist
who performs growing-experiment on ordinary rodent
in order to do a fellow scientist a favor .
due to some incredibly stupid animal right activist 
the huge and ravenous rat escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus .
following the good old tradition
that spielberg 's `` jaws '' started ,
there is an obnoxious dean
who refuses to admit the problem
even though severely mutilated corpse are turning up everywhere .
during a hysterically grotesque climax 
the rat invade the opening ceremony of the campus ' new sport complex !
`` gnaw :
food of the god 2 '' is terribly bad
and therefore a lot of fun to watch !
the character do
and say
unimaginably stupid stuff
( like descending into the sewer unarmed
while they know
it is infested with rat ) ,
the acting is atrocious
and there is a genuinely bizarre sequence
involving the hero
having sex under the influence of growth-serum !
i wonder what freud 's theory would be on that !
there is a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and \u0096
it has to be said
\u0096 the music is surprisingly atmospheric .
in case you just can not get enough of this junk ,
there are quite a lot of creature-feature revolving on mutated rat 
like the italian schlock film `` rat :
night of terror '' 
the modest 70 's cult film `` willard '' and its lame sequel `` ben '' 
the 2003 `` willard '' remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat-movie by once-famous director tibor ticak
( `` rat '' )
and john lafia
( `` the rat '' ) .
go nut !
