for all of the hype about this film 
i kept an open mind
as to what i would ultimately think .
and 
although a bit slow at time 
the first 90 % of the movie is quite good 
with more than a few `` old time '' scare
that make one jumpy and unsettled .
i actually thought
the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scene .
where dark remains fail 
however 
is in its climax .
the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be mile apart from its body .
the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and ,
the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma ?
- was not elucidated upon !
the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best ,
and in the end 
i felt very cheated .
what could have been a superb horror film
was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending .
