with oliver hardy bedeviled by the sound of horn 
bell 
phone and trombone 
his doctor finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk .
partner stan laurel comes up with a great solution ,
living on a docked boat
so the salt sea air can help ollie get all the rest he needs .
it is a great premise for all the mad cap hijink to ensue ,
as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat 
and an escaped convict
( richard cramer )
stows along for the ride.i got a kick out of all the gag in the film ,
starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'silence
while man are working ' .
the early story at the boy ' apartmant features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishap ,
with stan doing a banana within a banana bit .
laurel has a couple of great line in the picture ,
like `` we must have been dis-unconnected '' ,
but the one
that had me rolling
was his response to the criminal on board ship - `` self preservation is the last law of average '' - precisely !
i am not as great a student of laurel and hardy 's film as many on this board ,
all i know is i enjoyed them as a kid
and find them to be as entertaining today
as they were back in my youth .
on that count 
`` sap at sea '' provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun ,
well on it is way to hornomania .
