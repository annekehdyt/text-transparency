this was a great movie with a good cast ,
all of them hitting on all cylinder .
and when dianne keaton is at her best 
well ,
it just does not get any better than that .
but tom everett scott 
always underrated 
was even better .
he should be a star .
my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay .
none of the character ever acknowledged
that the dead daughter was not always a good person .
and neither was her mother ,
played by keaton .
at one point she eaks a promise
she made to one character
not to reveal
that he had been sleeping around .
one of the other commentator said
the movie had a `` political agenda '' .
that is a baffling thing to say .
there was no politic at all in this movie .
