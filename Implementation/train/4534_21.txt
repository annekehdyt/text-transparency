our teacher showed us this movie in first grade .
i have not seen it since .
i just watched the trailer though .
does this look like a first grade movie to you ?
i do not think so .
i was so horrified by this movie ,
i could barely watch it .
it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting
that little girl in half ,
and then there was the boy with ketchup !
i was freaked out by this film .
now today ,
being 20 ,
i probably would not feel that way .
i just wanted to share my experience and opinion
that maybe small child should not see this movie ,
even though it is pg .
be aware of the possible outcome
of showing this to kid .
i do not even remember what it was about ,
once was enough !
