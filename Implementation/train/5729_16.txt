this is an important film .
it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention .
there is a lot to like here .
the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic convention .
unlike a lot of recent american cinema 
this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place .
the dvd includes a lot of bonus feature ,
and there are two commentary
that explain
the movie for the viewer still befuddled after an initial viewing .
when the film screened at sundance 
it made more than a few audience member uncomfortable and angry .
this is a sunday morning coffee movie 
not a friday night party movie .
for the dedicated viewer 
it is a treasure trove .
