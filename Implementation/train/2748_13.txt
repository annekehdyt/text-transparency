this movie is a bad attempt
to make original fan feel complete .
the one thing person have forgotten is the fact
that the reason the original won such acclaim 
was strictly do to the fact
that it was supposed to make you feel
incomplete.this movie makes me want to go to the washroom .
i am not a negative type of guy ,
but man the acting in this flick is ... . no comment .
the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i
am sorry to have had two hour of my time and my money wasted on this flick .
i still love the original
and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it .
