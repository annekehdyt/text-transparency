the only reason
that i did not give this 10 star
was the dvd format-no menus 
extras 
etc .
however ,
if you have ever had a dream
to do something with your life ,
this film is for you .
if you believe
in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you .
this is one of the most life-affirming film
that i have ever seen .
and magical .
the acting is superb ,
the plot serves the purpose ,
and the opening sequence is fantastic .
this is one of those film
that `` cult '' status used to be about .
i have recommended this film to all of my friend .
some love it 
some can not finish it .
whenever i think 
or feel ,
that something is impossible i think about alan arkin 's role in this film .
sure wish he had make more film .
