i am so appalled by this documentary .
i am deeply embarrassed
and ashamed by the way puertorican were portrayed .
this documentary was not about the culture of puertorican .
it was about the culture of nuyorican .
puertorican and nuyorican are two different culture .
very different culture and should not be generalized to the puerto rican population .
rosie ,
before you make a documentary ,
you need to do the research .
you also need to check
and make sure
your source are credible .
puerto rican are not all loud
and they do have class ,
which is one thing
the documentary lacked to show .
when i saw rosie and jimmie on the view and rosie on martha stewart i was very excited about watching .
i even made sure to let my parent know
since they love puerto rico so much .
after the first five minute i could not believe
how the documentary bashed the us
and made puerto rican look like a bunch of guinea pig .
you need to go and visit puerto rico
and you will see
that puerto rico is not a 3rd world country
where more than 50 % of the population is in poverty .
puerto rico has college and well known university 
road 
car 
shopping center 
mall
( the largest kmart and jcpenney 's i
have ever seen ) 
restaurant 
theater 
beach 
hotel
( ritz 
hilton 
etc .
) 
casino 
church 
agriculture 
auto expresso 
and restaurant just to name a few .
poverty ?
not 50 % of the population is .
puerto rican culture is about family 
music 
food 
celeating ,
and trying to move forward not backward .
oh 
and new cousin do not just pop up out of no where .
no that is not a puerto rican thing ,
that is a ghetto thing .
we are not bastard .
parent of puertorican descent
who would like to teach their child about puerto rico
should invest in a trip with the family
so they can see first hand
what puerto rico is all about .
they will see its beauty 
person and culture .
please do not show them this documentary
because it will only cloud their mind with negativity .
oh 
and please do not tell your american friend to watch this documentary
because it will only make the puertorican person look ignorant.yes ,
i am born
and raised puerto rican from the island .
just so you know !
