hopelessly inept and dull movie
in which the character stand around in room or a rocket ship and talk endlessly .
you might think
thing would perk up
when they explore mar
but these scene are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter
which makes everything very murky .
the martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawing
and the monster are entirely unconvincing .
there are echo of 'bride of the monster '
when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about 
the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred time more entertaining .
better wear earplug
when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi ' music score ,
repeated endlessly 
will drive you insane .
if you find yourself unable to sleep one night
just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time .
