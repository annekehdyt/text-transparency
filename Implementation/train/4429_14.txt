i find it hard to understand
why this piece of utter trash was repackaged .
the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform .
her humour is also to be appreciated .
she is a definite plus
but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage .
however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort and true professionalism .
can not say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice
that grates on your nervous system .
appeared disinterested and gave the impression
that just her presence on the set was all
that was needed .
all said
apart from ariauna 's performance it is indeed utter trash .
