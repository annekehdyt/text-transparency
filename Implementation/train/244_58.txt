this movie was on the romance channel ,
and i thought
it might be a goofy 80 's movie
that would be enjoyable on some level ,
so my other and i watched it .
boy did it suck .
boy gets crush on girl
-- correction 
his *dream*-girl
( apparently there
is a difference ;
and i am surprised
he realized
she was his dream girl --
he was smitten with her from over 30 foot away .
i guess
that just goes to show the power of dream-girls ) ,
boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl
( creative in the sense
that it is a far-out plan ,
but un-creative in the sense
that there are probably better solution one might think up ) 
awkward situation ensue 
a match is made
( all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon
-- either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting ,
or the actor had to wait
until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set ;
i suspect the latter ) .
very clumsily done 
very pathetic .
it is almost never even amusing *accidentally* ,
so there really is nothing
to redeem it .
unless you are interested in seeing chad lowe 's early day ,
before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role
as the hiv-positive gay guy on the series `` life goes on '' 
or gail o'grady
who was on nypd blue
and probably got to stare at dennis franz 's buttock ) .
but those are unlikely motive
-- i would say
`` systematic derangement of the sense '' would be a more justified purpose .
i am surprised
i watched it all .
i guess
it is the kind of thing
where 
halfway through ,
you find yourself *still* watching due to some morbid 
self-flagellistic inner-issue ,
and think
you might as well finish
it so you can tell your friend and family
that you actually sat through such a horrible movie 
on the off-chance
that it will garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health .
can *you* take the challenge ?
