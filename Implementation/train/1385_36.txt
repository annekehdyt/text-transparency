the sopranos
( now preparing to end )
is the very peak of adult television and drama .
when the sopranos hits the mark ,
it really hits the mark .
using great writing and great actor
( most of them being extra from goodfellas )
the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way .
heading up the cast is jame gandolfini ,
who for all intensive purpose is tony soprano 
and edie falco ,
who certainly holds her own .
the series also boasts a great collection of regular
to push the plot
along by any mean necessary
( usually violence and foul language ) .
tony sirico 
michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary character
that make every episode more interesting .
seasonal extra are also worth note
including name like steve buscemi
( great !
) ,
joe pantoliano
( great !
) 
david proval
( good ) ,
robert patrick 
robert loggia and frank vincent.the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia society
that despite the rare bad story line manages to be unique tv .
symbolism and simple story line 
dream and shoot-out and many other thing create intertwining story and relationship
that at the end of each season are resolved
to create yet another perfect hbo package .
watch it ...
