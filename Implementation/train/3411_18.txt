cecil b. demille really knew how to create a classic ,
and after 7 decade his western comes across as the real mccoy 
engrossing 
entertaining 
spectacular ;
in no way outdated.as a real fan of tv 's deadwood ,
i will tell you the performance of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor
as calamity jane are far more on-target.we do not have any giant in hollywood anymore .
plainsman is just one of dozen of classic from the 1936-1945 decade
that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade :
released 
re-issued 
re-issued all over again .
filmmaker like today 's spielberg 
jackson 
bruckheimer are like kid
playing in a sandbox .
none of today 's movie will be sought out in 7 month let alone 70 year .
