i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program ,
and i thought
it was awful ,
as i said in my tagline ,
it was pretentious 
trite 
petty and phenomenally self-important.i consider myself a fan of film ,
and all the thing
that film has to offer .
if i want to watch a documentary on the canne festival ,
i will watch aande ... .and
they would probably be alot more objective about it.i do not recommend it 
period .
