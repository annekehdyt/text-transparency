hg is normally exploitive ,
and it is never really bothered me before
-- i loved `` bloodfeast 2 '' ,
but i really do not like pseudo science or playing on heuristic .
the whole movie is based on a man with esp
caused by an electrical accident and a witch .
i am not opposed to witch ,
and i liked `` carrie ''
( the novel and the movie )
but this one bothered me .
i think
it is because of the main character developing esp from an electric line .
also the university professor wasting his time studying esp case .
i was not alive in the 60s to know first hand
whether or not esp was a common fallacy then ,
but i assume
that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited .
what really bothered me was the way
the police were describing schizophrenic as ruthless 
unpredictable villain
who can seem like normal person 99 % of the time and then just snap .
nothing could be further from the truth .
i detest such concept
because they add to public idiocy .
many person still think
that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder .
whoever wrote
this script did not know
much about psychology.there were some decent concept to the movie .
i liked the way
the witch used man ;
it was a nice change .
i liked how she could make herself attractive ,
but did not when she was around her forced lover .
i found
it interesting how her second lover also burned his face .
had the script been touched up for a few week before production
and not focused solely on making its audience dumber ,
this may have been a decent movie .
