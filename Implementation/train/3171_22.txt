when i was younger ,
i thought
the first film was really good in childhood ,
so i decided to see the sequel .
this is an example of why some film should not have sequel ,
because the first film is usually best ,
and it is .
basically now that ariel and eric are married
they have a daughter
who is not allowed outside the house
because they are worried about the sister of ursula
( the octopus legged villain from film one ) ,
morgana getting to her .
when the kid gets out
she asks ursula 's sister to turn her into a mermaid ,
like her mum was .
this makes ariel go back to the sea
to find her .
the same good voice artist 
it is just the story
that could have had a bit more thought .
adequate !
