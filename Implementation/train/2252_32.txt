ever notice how in his later movie burt reynold ' laugh sound like screeching ake ? must have been hanging out with hal needham too much.and from the look of `` stroker ace '' ,
way too much.can you believe
this was based on a book ?
neither could i ,
but it was .
and probably not a best-seller 
i will wager .
burt 's another good-old-boy in the nascar circuit
who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with design on his team .
anderson provides what love interest
there is and nabor does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic/best friend lug .
a lot of person here are friend of burt 's or hal 's .
other must have needed the work .
and even real nascar driver get in on the act ,
and look to have more talent than those with sag card .
as far as laugh go 
bubba smith
( pre- '' police academy '' )
gets them as beatty 's chauffeur .
and petersen 
in full elvira mode 
gets lot of appreciative leer as a lady
who wants to get to know lug real well .
real well.it is a shame
that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like `` stroker ace ''
where it did not matter
whether he bothered to act or not .
they did not bother to write a character for him ,
why bother to act ? two star .
mostly for petersen 
and for the out-take at the end .
now they are funny .
