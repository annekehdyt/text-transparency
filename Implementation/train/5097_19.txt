for those of us baby boomer
who arrived too late on the scene
to appreciate jame dean et .
al. 
martin sheen showed us the way
in this great feature.the premise is easy enough :
cool hood meet small town sheriff and all-hell ensue ,
but the nut and bolt of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us .
no 
this is not casablanca ,
nor is it great literature ,
but it is a serious movie about car 
rebellion 
and the genius
that is martin sheen.enjoy this
and appreciate it for what it is ,
and for what martin will become .
i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70 's ,
and you will too .
