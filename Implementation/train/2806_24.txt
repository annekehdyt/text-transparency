being half-portuguese does not render me half-blind
( nor half-prejudiced )
when discussing portuguese film .
not that i get to do that very often anyway .
but this film was such a rush of adrenaline !
yes 
that is right -
it was mostly accurate as far as history went/go -
but it pulled no punch on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory :
thing like using real location in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd
to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 year ago .
and by god did they get it right !
ok 
to sum it up :
very emotional
if you have lived through it ,
but you will spot minor improvement
that could have been made as well as plot necessity
that were .
if you are just watching it randomly ,
you are in for a good historical romp 
only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual .
even by european standard 
yes .
