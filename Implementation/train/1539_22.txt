down to earth is about lance barton 
a black comedian
who gets hit by a truck .
he goes to heaven
and he gets to get another body .
lance gets the body of charle wellington 
a white guy .
so lance does a few thing in the body of charle .
the movie has a few laugh ,
but it is nothing special .
it is a good movie
if you are a fan of chris rock .
madagascar 
the 2005 animated comedy 
is better .
this is a good movie ,
but chris rock has done way better thing than this .
it will only make you laugh about 4 time the whole movie .
and it is not really laugh-out-loud funny .
you will laugh to yourself
and you might giggle ,
but you definitely will not be rolling on the floor laughing .
