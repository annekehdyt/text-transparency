a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work
adding to the dramatic makes this a treat to watch and enjoy .
director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation
( many called it a `` ripoff '' )
with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work
( and several scene with person hiding on each side
which are lost on formatted-for-tv tape )
.the downside of the movie 
at least to anyone
that has some kind of moral standard ,
is the general sleaziness of all the character ,
including the policeman
played by a pre-nypd dennis franz
( who has hair here ! ) .
the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson
that is quite explicit 
even 25 year after its release .
the film has several erotic scene in it as dickinson
( if that is really her on the closeups )
and nancy allen are not shy about showing
their bodies.there is not much dialog in the first 20 minute and no bad language
until franz enter the picture after the murder .
the first 36 minute are riveting
and
even though it is apparent
who the killer is ,
it is still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through 
particularly for male ogling the naked woman .
