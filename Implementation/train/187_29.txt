this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with .
the character are the familiar dispossessed young male frequently to be seen hanging around
bored in a sea side town .
robert is an outsider
but he has his music
which could have been his soul .
instead clay makes robert into a freak
who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy
and getting in with the wrong crowd .
clay seems to believe in `` reefer madness ''
and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist .
one wonders how much experience of real life
this young director has .
no one can save poor robert .
clay leaves us with the message
that young british man are out of control .
a very unsubtle link is made to the iraqi insurgent ;
during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosion and image of war .
the film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it is limit .
the young bomber in london draw a parallel with clay 's hateful depiction of modern male .
clay imply
that man simply can not help themselves from inflicting terrible act of violence .
it is a wonder
the british film industry allows money to be invested in film
which advocate such divisive propaganda ,
when in london we are still reeling from the recent attack .
this is clay 's first film ,
i would be delighted
if it is his last .
