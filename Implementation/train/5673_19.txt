japanese indie film with humor and philosophy
where the three main character run literally almost through the entire film ,
chasing each other due to strange circumstance and comical coincidence .
as they are running ,
we see what is going on in their mind
and how they got
where they are at the moment .
the act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck person 's life .
in some way 
what they are really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing 
but for meaning in their life and an escape from their personal problem and oken dream .
running makes them all feel
truly alive .
the big life-altering running adventure comes to an end
when they accidentally get in the middle of something big 
violent 
and so absurd
that it is funny in a clever way .
one of my favorite film of all time by geniu director sabu .
