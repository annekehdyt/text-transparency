tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke
the horror genre has to offer .
like any other horror fan 
i loved the texas chainsaw ,
but i think
that
in order to put your name in front on a movie title ,
you should have at least more than one hit movie .
i can not really think
of any other movie hooper has done
( on his own 
do not count poltergeist )
that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world .
and this movie 
night terror 
just backs up my point.poor robert englund ,
i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material
he was given .
he did what he could .
as for the movie itself ?
pure drudge .
unnecessary nude scene every five minute 
a story
that must have been penned in an our ,
and really just awful scenery 
music 
and cinematography .
nothing in this film is redeemable .
do not waste your time.overall 
1/10 .
i feel sorry for hooper ,
his career seems like it was over
before it really ever got started .
i hope
that he is able to pump out at least one more good flick ,
that way he can do his cult status some justice .
