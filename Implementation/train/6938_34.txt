wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque
( blandly
played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role )
joins a group of researcher
who want to find
and destroy the secret technique
of creating zombie .
armand falls for the lovely claire duval
( fetching blonde dorothy stone ) ,
who uses the meek sap
to get armand 's colleague clifford grayson
( the hopelessly wooden robert noland )
to marry her .
furious over being used and spurned by claire ,
armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge .
sound exciting ?
well 
it sure are not .
for starter 
victor halperin 's static
( non )
direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace .
worse yet 
halperin crucially fails to ing any tension 
atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings .
the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast does not help matter any ;
only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e. alyn warren as the irascible dr. trevissant manage to enliven thing a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionic .
the drippy stock film liary score 
the painfully obvious stagebound set 
and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well .
in fact 
this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy
that not even the uncredited starkly staring eye of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the ain-numbing boredom .
a dismally dull dud .
