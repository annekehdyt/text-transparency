i sat through this movie this evening ,
forcing myself to stick with it
even though i never cared about any of the character
or what happened to them ,
because the two lead 
g\u00e9rard philippe and mich\u00e8le morgan 
were major film star of their era and i wanted to see them in `` something different 
''
which this certainly was .
they both gave fine performance ,
but of distasteful character.indeed 
the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful character
( the doctor is 
of course 
the major exception ) .
what mich\u00e8le morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him
is never explained.this is supposedly based on a work by jean-paul sartre .
all i could think
was that ,
if sartre 's work is anything like this movie ,
it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus ' masterful novel the plague ,
which dealt with a plague in north africa.a well-acted but uninteresting movie .
