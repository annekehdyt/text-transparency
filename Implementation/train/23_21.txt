clocking in at an interminable three hour and twenty minute 
`` salaam-e-ishq '' is a pretty
but superficial comic soap opera from india
that regales us with six interwoven tale of romantic love
( which is at least four tale too many in my estimation )
.filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial ,
the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic setting 
dazzling color 
sexy showgirls 
high-stepping song-and-dance number 
dream and fantasy sequence 
winking character aside 
corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performance - all pretty much standard-issue stuff
when it comes to bollywood happening these day .
it is an exhausting chore
just trying to keep all the character straight
as they dance 
prance and preen their way
through the incomprehensible storyline.there is plenty for the viewer to feast his eye on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous woman -
but he will need the patience of job
to get him all the way through it .
