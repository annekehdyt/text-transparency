this movie is the first of miike triad society trilogy 
and the trilogy kick of to a great start .
the movie in the trilogy are only connected thematically ,
and these theme are actually apparent in all his film ,
if you look close enough .
shinjuku triad society is about a cop
trying to prevent his kid other from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsider ,
struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza .
the kid other is a lawyer ,
and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one 
as the movie progresses .
the movie takes place in a very harsh environment ,
and is therefore pretty violent and tough .
miike has done worse ,
but since this is a serious movie
it hits you very hard .
as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex 
mostly homosexual in this one .
the movie is in many way a typical gangster movie ,
but with a great drive and true grittiness .
if you have only seen miike far-out movie
( ichi the killer 
fudoh etc . )
this is worth checking out
since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style
displayed in those movie
and his more serious side ,
as seen in the other film of the trilogy .
and as alway with miike 
there are at least two scene in this
that you will never forget
( see it and figure out which one for yourself )
.8/10
