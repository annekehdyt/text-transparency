walter pidgeon is braley mason 
a civil attorney
who takes on a criminal case in `` the unknown man 
''
a 1951 film also starring ann harding 
barry sullivan 
keefe braselle 
and richard anderson .
a great believer in justice 
pidgeon accepts a pro bono case
defending a young man ,
rudi walchek
( braselle )
accused of murder and gets him acquitted .
shortly afterward 
he realizes
that the man is guilty
and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeeper in the neighborhood .
he is advised by the da
( sullivan )
that rudi is small change ,
that to wipe out the organized crime ,
one has to find the top man .
mason finds the top man ,
and is faced with a dilemma .
`` the unknown man '' is a small 
black and white film
that manages to hold the viewer 's interest with its various plot twist ,
though the plot is somewhat contrived .
it is really the story of a good man
seeking his god 
justice ,
and what he is willing to do in order to attain it .
and that is the most contrived part of all .
i suppose there was a time before o.j. 
the menendez brother 
etc. 
etc. ,
when person believed in justice and the integrity of attorney .
for this viewer anyway 
those day are long over.walter pidgeon does an excellent job
-- his handsome 
elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful 
confident man
but also a deeply caring one .
pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 year
but never really rose to superstardom .
he was a solid actor
who could play just about anything and did .
it may be because by the time he was getting lead ,
he was well into his thirty
and missed being a matin\u00e9e idol ;
or it could be he lacked that certain something ;
or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson .
hard to say .
he gives an honest and touching performance here.very good movie with good performance .
