throughout this film ,
you might think
this film is just for kid .
well 
it is mainly pointed toward them ,
but it is also well-rounded enough with the joke pointed also at the adult in the audience .
this time around 
the muppet gang try to get on broadway ,
with the dire strait
keeping them from getting it produced ,
leading them to splitting up .
but kermit will not stop ,
and his determination keeps thing moving along until
after getting the deal together
he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia !
it is a send-up 
in part 
of those old starring vehicle from the 40s with musical actually as the topic of a musical ,
only here there is the usual lot of zaniness
and wonderful moment thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moment
( lou zealand 's boomerang fish ;
gonzo 's water-stunt display 
the whisper campaign 
among many other ) ,
but also with a lot of heart too .
the muppet writer are not shy of the convention 
on the contrary ,
they emace them to the point
where it is almost refreshing to see such a 'let put on a show ' story where through thick
and think
the character will meet their dream .
while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie ,
it is got many catchy and memorable song 
excellent location all over manhattan 
and even some intonation of inter-specy dating
( and marriage ) !
cameo include liza minneli
( `` a frog ?
`` ) 
elliot gould
( as the cop ) ,
brooke shield
( propositioned by a rat ) ,
edward i. koch 
gregory hine and joan river .
so get ready to sing-along ,
or just have a lot of big laugh and romantic
( yes romantic )
time with one of the best muppet movie .
