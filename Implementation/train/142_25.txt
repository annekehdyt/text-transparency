being a film study graduate i
would like to think
that i have seen a diverse range of film 
some good and some bad ,
but i would have to say
that 'summer rain ' is by far the worse film i have ever seen !
i chose the film in the hope
that it was going to be a great british classic such as 'secret and ly ' or 'lockstock '
but oh no this was so bad
that my flat mate and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script
( reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education ' school production ) .
the main character michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start .
'michelle ' the main character
who lives with her two friend
has the type of face
that you would never get tired of slapping and gary
was so wet
( he kept eaking down in tear every 5 minute )
that by the end of the film i really did not give a damn about either of them .
all i could think
was ' i paid \u00a33 for this pile ' .
i have never written a review
before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn person of this disastrous production .
so please avoid at all cost .
thank for reading .
