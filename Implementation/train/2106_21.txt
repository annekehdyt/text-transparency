this is a cleaver film
featuring love through the age .
the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age 
in ancient rome and in the present
( 1920s ) .
in all three case 
he is the usual wimpy buster
and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love .
of the three time period 
i think
i liked the roman one best
even though i admit
it might have also been the cheesiest .
i actually liked the scene with the lion
that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow
-- but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton 's amazing acrobatic .
however 
all three time period were good old fashioned fun and the film ,
while not his best ,
is still an exceptional and enjoyable film .
check it out !
