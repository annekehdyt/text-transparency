... than this ; - )
what would happen
if terry gilliam and douglas adam would have worked together on one movie ?
this movie start with a touch of brazil ...
when 
at a certain point 
the story move straight into the twilight zone ... inging up nothing new ,
but just nothing ...
and nothing is great fun !
when dave and andrew start to explore their new environment
the movie gets really enjoyable ...
bouncing head ?
well ... yes ; - )
anyway ...
this movie was 
imho 
the biggest surprise at this year 's fantasyfilmfest ...
just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic 
weird but very special design ,
which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time ... timeless somehow ...
