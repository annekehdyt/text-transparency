when i go to see a movie about zombie 's ,
i am not expecting oscar calie performance 
or writing on the level of the godfather ,
but i do expect the actor to at least not look like their straining to read their cue card ,
and dialogue
that does not sound like it was typed out 10 minute
before the actor reads it into the camera .
this movie was just awful ,
i actually got up and left about 25 minute in and went next door
and watched cold creek manor ,
that was not very good either ,
but it seemed like citizen kane
compared to this pile of crap .
on the plus side 
the girl were very pretty ,
that is probably the only thing
that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minute ,
in fact i left
after the hottest one got killed ,
there was not anything to hold my interest after that .
