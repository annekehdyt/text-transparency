i have just had the evidence
that confirmed my suspicion .
a bunch of kid 
14 to 22 put on the dvd of `` titanic '' on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal .
only two of them had actually seen it before .
but they all had seen the moment of kate 
leo and celine dion so many time
that most of them felt
they had seen the whole movie .
shortly after the epic started ,
they started to get restless ,
some of them left
asking the other
-- `` call us
when the iceberg appears '' over an hour and a half into the movie ,
only the two girl
who had seen the movie before ,
were still there .
they started shouting :
iceberg 
iceberg .
a stampede followed ,
they all came back
to see the sinking of the titanic .
they sat open mouthed 
emitting ohs and far out .
so 
just like i thought
when the movie first burst into the scene .
what is this ?
one and a half hour waiting for the bloody thing to sink
but what about the rest of the of it .
dr. zivagho 
for instance 
had a similar running time ,
but think
how much takes place in that film within the same period of time .
in `` titanic '' leo teach kate how to spit .
look at the faces and hand of the 
supposedly 
creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship .
look at the historical detail ,
if you can find them .
the storyline is so thin
that they have to introduce gun and shooting in a ship
that is about to sink .
the real sinking here is of film standard .
all the effort are focus on special effect and opening week end .
the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so ,
what do i know ?
