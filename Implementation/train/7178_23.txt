there were only two thing
that kept me interested in this film :
i was waiting for owen wilson to die ,
and catherine zeta jone.this was basically a one woman show .
catherine zeta jone was just there to provide eye-candy .
liam neeson was totally wasted in this film .
like jone 
he had no role at all .
the film was all lily taylor
( ransom 
ready to wear ) .
she was the only one
that had any real part in this crappy script by david self .
ok 
it was his first one
and he did redeem himself with road to perdition.i do not know
what director jan de bont 's problem was .
he did a great job with speed and twister .
he really fell down on the job here .
maybe he was still recovering from the disaster speed 2 :
cruise control .
he should thank his lucky star for the wild wild west ,
else this would be the worst picture of 1999.avoid at all cost .
