several year ago
when i first watched `` grey garden ''
i
remember laughing
and finding it hilarious camp .
year later i still laugh out loud
when i watch it ,
but after many viewing i have come to see the beauty in the strange 
twisted relationship between the inseparable `` big '' edith bouvier beale and her daughter `` little '' edith bouvier beale.mother and daughter
living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term `` shabby chic '' .
with innumerable cat 
raccoon and opossum as roommate this aunt and niece of jackie o. allowed filmmaker albert and david maysle into their mansion to film them living life day to day .
the result is a hilarious 
beautiful 
sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule.the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the uneakable bond of love .
and their life an example of drive 
determination and free-will .
this movie has more to recommend it
than i can put down into word .
it is a rare experience
that you must see for yourself .
