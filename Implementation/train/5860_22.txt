the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the character grow from their experience and emerge from the experience altered in some significan not way
( note
that this change need not be positive or beneficial )
at the end.by that measure 
enchanted april is a resounding success .
as a film in general ,
it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast ,
well-developed character you come to care about 
wonderful script and beautiful set and location .
in short the film is 
well 
enchanting .
although all the performance are first-rate ,
three must be mentioned-josie lawrence 
jim broadbent and joan plowright .
it says
something
when miranda richardson does her usual fine work
and yet is overshadowed by so many other in the cast .
most highly recommended 
particularly if you are a romantic at heart .
further deponent saith not .
