the movie was watchable
while nicolson was on the screen .
however 
i had to fight against passing out from boredom
when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scene
without jack ;
she was as bland
as could be .
the relationship between the character was nothing special ;
these character have been portrayed before
-- and much better .
it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense :
90 % of daily life is boring ,
and not worth writing about or watching .
why ephron felt her life
and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough
to write about escape me .
perhaps she wrote it as therapy
-- for many writer ,
putting an episode from their life on paper
is cathartic .
fine :
but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me .
