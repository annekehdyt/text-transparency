maybe i am a sap
but this is the sweetest movie ever !
i saw it for the first time
when i was around 4 or 5 ,
and i cried my eye out .
between then and now ( embarrassed at age 15 )
i have seen it over 25 time
and have sobbed each and every one of them .
do not worry
they are tear of happiness !
and it is not all sap !
there is a lot of humor and comedy in it too .
usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie
it is not the case .
my only word of advice :
even if you love this-do not see the sequal ... cornyness !
i suggest
everyone check this out ...
you will not be sorry ,
no matter how old or young you are !
