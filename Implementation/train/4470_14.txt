this movie wastes virtually every actor 's talent
in what could best be charitably called a `` potboiler '' .despite
it is action-packed 'top gun ' opening
it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotype and unlikely situation
following each other
until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn.there
are so many dead-end story line in this movie i was guessing at one point
it was made by splicing together a discarded tv series.quinn 's mexican drug-lord role is laughable and his 'associate ' plucked right out of a 1970 's quinn-martin cop show .
costner 's character is wooden
and gives us no reason to believe
he actually fell in love with mendez ' wife .
nor are we convincingly led to believe
the wife is aching for companionship
and will jump the first hot body coming along.definitely a 'b ' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved .
