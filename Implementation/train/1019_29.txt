actually this movie was not so bad .
it contains action 
comedy and excitement .
there are good actor in this film 
for instance doug hutchison
( percy from `` the green mile '' ) ,
who play bristol .
another well known actor is jamie kennedy 
from `` scream '' and `` three king '' .
the main character are played by jamie foxx as alvin ,
who was pretty good
and also funny ,
but the one
who most surprised me ,
was david morse as edgar clenteen .
he play a different character
than he usually does ,
because in other film like `` the green mile '' 
`` indian runner '' 
`` the negotiator '' or `` the langolier '' he play a very sympathetic person ,
and in `` bait '' the play almost the opposite 
a man
without any emotion ,
which was nice to see .
the only really negative thing about this film ,
are the several picture of the world trade center ,
which makes this film perhaps look a little dated .
overall i thought
this was a pretty good little film !
