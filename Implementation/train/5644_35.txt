no sense going over the story
since enough reviewer have done that .
here is a few different slant on it from one of those `` religious nut 
''
as one bigoted reviewer put it so tolerantly .
1 )
`` baby face ''
( 1933 )
offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how woman can manipulate man with sex .
there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrate in this film :
look cute 
bat your eyelash ,
offer your body for free ...
..and man will fall over themselves
to help you out with whatever you want.in this case ,
it was job advancemant with the ultimate goal of money ... ..lot of it .
at least four man in this film do provide just that ,
even if it ruins their life in the process .
2 )
the ending -
which many of the reviewer here seemed to hate - gives another great message :
all the money and material good in the world will not make a person feel fulfilled .
a sad commant
that so many `` critic '' here would rather have immoral message ,
preferring sleaze over substance .
no surprise 
i guess.any way you look at it ,
the movie is entertaining start-to-finish
and stanwyck has some great line 
particularly in the beginning
when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customer .
at a little over 70 minute 
this film moves at a fast pace
and is over
before you know it .
