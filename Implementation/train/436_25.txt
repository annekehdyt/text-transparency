actually i am surprised
there were so many comment about this movie .
i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university .
but nobody in usa has heard of it ,
which is a real shame !
the dynamic between the person are what makes it both funny and sad .
they are stuck together on a long bus trip
-- someplace most of us have been ! !
but i never had one like this ! !
my favorite scene is the one
where they stop for the funeral .
then the man and woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch
without them knowing !
just as she raises her skirt
and he enters her all the way
-- the consumptive start hacking
and they realize
everybody is watching ! !
talk about surprised !
but ... you really have to feel for them
even if it is hilariously funny !
when you see the ending it is sort of ironic
that they enjoyed themselves
while they did !
serb humor at it is best !
