lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series
that have never done ...
and so is ...

intrigue and adventure this is the series for you ... in the first season ...
since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward
until you get to the second season ... in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation
and push very on and reveal the various mystery
that the island hide ... the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful
because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season ...
the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mystery ... but not as the second season but at a somewhat different ... for the fifth season expects ...
