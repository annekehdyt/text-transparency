why oh
why can not anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale ?
this is the second adaptation of `` beowulf '' i have been disappointed with in a year .
but i have to say ,
the previous version
( `` beowulf and grendel '' ,
starring gerald butler )
was far superior to this .
that one was only a little disappointing .
this one is a mess ! ! !
what bugged me most ?
was it the useless plot elemant
they added in for no particular reason
( human sacrifice ?
pointless love interest ?
) 
or the bad cgi 
or the inconsistency of the character or the uninspired acting ?
even worse was the way
they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible ! ! !
and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ?
and why did they continually remind us
that beowulf had the strength of 30 man ,
and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film .
he was tossed around by both monster
he fought ,
relying on his sidekick to save his bacon .
even when he slugged the arrogant prince ,
he did not knock him out .
he was much too reliant on weapon .
beo-wimp is more like it .
this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem !
i would like to end this on a positive note
but i can not really think of one offhand .
all i can say is ,
if you have ever read `` beowulf '' ,
you will be infinitely disappointed by this dismal ,
inaccurate excuse for an adaptation !
