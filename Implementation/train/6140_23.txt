this version is pretty insipid ,
i am afraid .
jane eyre is one of my favorite book
and has been since childhood ,
but william hurt 's weary ,
throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsough look like a bored 
petulant teenager
whose dental ace hurt !
i also can not believe
that they eliminated edward 's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book 
one of the most moving moment in literature .
i do appreciate
that they finally used such a young 
plain woman to play jane 
a character
who is supposed to be a worldly 18 ,
but if you want to see a version
that closer approximates the personality and passion of the novel 
please see the 70 's version with george c. scott and susannah york .
york was too old 
tall and pretty to play jane ,
but no one has touched rochester 's character the way
that scott did .
