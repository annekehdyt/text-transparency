the premise of this movie was decent enough ,
but with sub par acting ,
it was just bland and dull.spoilers the film does not work
because of the nature of the death ,
it was accidental ,
so although it was a murder
it was not like the guy set out
to do it .
also through some flashback there is a secret
that is revealed that sort of makes the event like justice to a degree .
there is no emotion in this film .
the first 20 minute or so is just this woman
calling her sister ,
and hearing her message .
it was dull and boring.with some polishing ,
and better acting it could have been pretty good .
