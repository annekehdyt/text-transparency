this movie is pretty good .
half a year ago 
i bought it on dvd .
but first i thought
that it was the original film .
i have seen the series
and it is a good film ,
but here 
they have put `` the living legend 
part1 and 2 '' 
and `` fire in space '' together .
the same as they did with the first film 
but with other episode .
but still 
it is a pretty good film .
only the ending is strange
( you do not see what happens with the pegasus ) .
but i still think
that it is pretty good .
the actor and special effect were good .
if you have not seen it ,
go see it .
starring :
richard hatch 
dirk benedict 
lorne greene 
herb .
jefferson jr. 
tony swartz 
terry carter 
lloyd bridge 
jack stauffer .
