have no illusion ,
this is a morality story .
granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter ,
tempted back to the plain one more time by kill-crazed taylor .
granger can see the end is near ,
and feel deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herd 
the indian and the land itself .
taylor 
on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo 
or indian to 'being with a woman . '
while granger 's role of the tortured hunter is superb ,
it is taylor who steals the show 
as the demented 
immoral 'everyman ' out for the fast buck and the goodtime .
there is not a lot of bang-bang here ,
but the story move along quickly ,
and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan .
the theme of this story is just as poignant today 
as in the 1800s-man 's relationship to the land
and what is on it ,
and racism .
considering
when this was made ,
the censor must have been wringing their hankie during the scene in the 'bawdy house ' 
taylor 's relationship with the squaw 
and much of the dialogue .
although downbeat 
this is truly a great western picture .
