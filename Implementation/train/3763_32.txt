the neil simon 's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burn is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness ,
but the laughter always bitter taste .
seeing willy clark
( matthau )
and al lewis
( burn )
two big theatrical comedy actor now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age
you can feel only anger and blue .
willy not ever surrender
and continue to look work ,
while al is tired for player
and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter .
the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony ,
but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel ,
and for eleven year after their oken they not talk between .
now if they would work ,
they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show .
the meet is explosive and liberating for the old question .
the neil simon 's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gag
and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu
( nomination academy award as best actor )
and george burn
( won the academy award
as best support actor ) .
the two actor are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost
as they real work together for all that time
and that realty they not bear between them .
the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality
as the story is narrate
and how the report love-heat
that bind the two actor is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible thing to the life .
my rate is 7 .
