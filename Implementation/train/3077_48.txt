this movie was a rather odd viewing experience .
the movie is obviously based on a play .
now i am sure
that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie
it just does not feel terribly interesting enough to watch .
the movie is way too 'stagey '
and they did not even bothered to change some of the dialog
to make it more fitting for a movie .
instead what is presented
now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play 
with over-the-top character and staged dialog .
because of all this the storyline really does not work out
and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.it takes a while
before you figure out
that this is a comedy
you are watching .
at first you think
its a drama you are watching ,
with quirky character in it
but as the movie progresses you will notice
that the movie is more a tragicomedy ,
that leans really more toward the comedy genre ,
rather than the drama genre.the character and dialog are really the thing
that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one
that at time really become unwatchable .
sure 
the actor are great ; peter o'toole and susannah york 
amongst other
but they do not really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.the story
feel
totally disorientated .
basicaly the story is about nothing
and just mainly focuses on the other/sister character
played by peter o'toole and susannah york .
but what exactly is the story even about ?
the movie feel like a pointless and obsolete one
that has very little to offer .
like i said
before ;
i am sure
the story is good and interesting to watch on stage
but as a movie it really is not fitting
and simply does not work out.the editing is simply dreadful and time
and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequence .
more was to expect from director j. lee thompson ,
who has obviously done far better movie than this rather failed 
stage-play translated to screen ,
project.really not worth your time.4/10
