this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop 
tony costa and pat morita as a tokyo cop sent to detroit
to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor .
a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping
to sell it to a up and coming car company
ran by a man
named derrick jarryd .
unfortunately for him the man
who were supposed to negotiate the deal
killed him
and took the prototype .
an angry derek jarryd try to distance himself from phillip madra
who led the man .
but madra
( played by chris sarandon )
has none of it and threatens jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership .
meanwhile in the same junk yard
where the japanese man had been killed ,
a friend of tony costa was also killed by the same man .
tony 's friend had been watching the junk yard.tony sets out
to find the killer against his superior 's order .
tony is on robbery
while obviously homicide should investigate the case .
while tony is investigating the crime
he runs into the japanese cop and mistakingly
he arrests him .
eventually they end up working together on the case .
they make an odd pair
and there are some genuinely amusing part as well as some ridiculous scene such as pat morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking madra in the head .
but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie 
at least in my opinion .
jay leno is no actor ,
but he is likable in the role
and pat morita is good as well .
still 
they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film .
if you liked buddy cop film ,
cheesy 80 's movie or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommand this movie .
