i never really knew
who robert wuhl was before seeing this .
but after seeing
it i realized what a funny man he is .
this hbo special feature him teaching `` american history '' to new york university film student
and the man was just phenomenal .
he poked fun at almost every key historic event
that occurred not just in the u.s. but some other part of the world .
this documentary/comedy was a great satire
that made me question
if what i accept
as the infallible true history
is really true.i enjoyed
how mr. wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy
and made learning a lot more exciting .
i would recommend this to anyone interested in history
and is willing to question what his/her beliefs .
