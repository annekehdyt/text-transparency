i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say
that in all my 51 year on this planet
that is the worse
( supposibly child 's )
film i have ever seen in my life.i took my three grand child
to see it
and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 min .
the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day
but they were as tasteless as the film .
they should pay you to watch it not you pay them .
it is truly truly awful ,
there is no other way
to describe it .
the person
that made this film
should be ought to task for taking money under false pretences.aplogise for my spelling mistake
but i am so upset
that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchild regard
