this movie has not aged well .
maybe it is just the impact and artful characterization 
acting ,
and directing
that we have seen with the sopranos ,
but i just viewed prizzi 's honor for the first time 
on dvd 
alone.the experience
of watching it with an audience 24 year ago
must have been quite different ,
but i have to say ,
i was just appalled at the ending .
not just the violence of it ,
but the mere idea
that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.i enjoy a good shocker ,
but this seemed so out of character ... also ,
when was this move supposed to be set ?
the car all seemed like they were from the 1960s ,
and yet the world trade center tower { completed in 1973 } were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.another way
in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea
that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.somehow ,
mid-1980s audience found this film charming and funny .
mid-eighty 
meet the late ought :
only of you can live .
