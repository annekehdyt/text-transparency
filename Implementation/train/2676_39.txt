to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i
though it may be a bad idea
to make a show
that makes muslim use racial joke on themselves
but it is the exact opposite .
i realized
that the show doing
that can help person understand
that
if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life
it does not mean it is a terrorist thing .
it also show 's how person give the muslim a bad name
because they play on their stereotype ,
by watching the show regular person will realize
that all
though there may be bad muslim out
it does not mean we are all bad
we just try to live 1 day at a time ,
like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane
and how he used word like `` blow up '' or yaser saying
we will blow away the competition ,
and person took it the wrong way .
being a muslim i know
that stuff like this do not usually happen ,
but they do and many person think
bad thing about muslim or afghanistan or iraq ,
its not right thing are not like that .
person will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show
and it may make them think on how the act .
i am glad a show like this came on the air .
there are many show
that piotr muslim person as terrorist 
many person do find them funny to my opioion
it is ok to do it now
and then
because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say
you can not make fun of that is unfair ,
but it is done to often
and really gives muslin person a bad name .
