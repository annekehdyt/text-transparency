you remember the spice girl movie
and how bad it was
( besides the song ) ,
well their manager simon fuller
( also this band 's manager )
makes the same error putting s club
( another of my favourite band )
in their own film .
s club :
tina barrett 
jon lee 
bradley mcintosh 
jo o'meara 
hannah spearritt and rachel steven
( what happened to the seventh member 
paul cattermole ? )
basically ask their boss for a eak ,
they go on ,
and while there they see themselves on tv !
three of them swap 
and vice versa 
half discover
they are clone made by a greedy scientist ,
and the other half just get themselves in trouble .
also starring gareth gate as a clone of himself .
this film may have more of a plot than spice girl ' film did ,
but besides the song `` bring it all back '' ,
`` do not stop movin ' ''
and `` never had a dream come true ''
this is no goo reason to see this film .
not too long after the band split for good .
adequate !
