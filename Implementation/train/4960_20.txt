if i could give this film a real rating ,
it would likely be in the minus number .
while i respect the fact
that somebody has to keep making these terrible `` horror '' film 
seriously 
person ,
buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money
you could be spending on something far more worth your time.despite
it being a horror film ,
there is nothing scary about it 
unless the idea
of seeing how many horror clich\u00e9 's you can fit in one movie scares you .
if the rating had been higher ,
it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.whoever made this version of `` prom night '' ,
you screwed up .
the actor could probably have done a decent job
if it were not for the questionable scripting .
this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip .
i would sooner go and see `` one missed call '' again ,
at least that had some plot .
