shocking 
well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces.small town doctor try to discover
who 
or what 
is committing a series of violent sexual murders.incubus is a tight mystery 
with some horrific murder sequence ,
that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist .
the murder scene are intense and gory ,
so this is not a film for the squeamish !
the direction of john hough 
along with a bizarre music score ,
combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread
that runs through out the film .
it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well .
nice filming location and some stylish camera work
also highlight.the cast is not bad either .
the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town .
also good are the performance of kerrie keane as the local reporter 
helen hughe as the town historian ,
and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen.all around incubus is a forgotten horror film
that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated .
*** out of ****
