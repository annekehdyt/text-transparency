with goldie hawn and peter seller in a movie
you figure
this one will not go wrong .
but what can i say ?
this was a horrible misfire .
the movie is about peter seller as an older gentleman
who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young
not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn .
the movie is incredibly disjointed
and i did not understand anything about it .
peter seller and goldie hawn are very funny person
but this movie does not prove it.that song about \u0091arabella cinderella ' is pretty cool ,
but that is it .
i only recommend this movie to person
that like to watch an extreme novelty movie ,
this is almost the definition of one .
i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the time ,
in term of it is definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality ,
the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing ,
not to mention the direction is just so out there .
peter seller in particular is very hit and miss ,
he will go from dr. strangelove
and being there throughout his career 
to dumb movie like this and the magic christian ,
which was very similar to this one in context and style ,
but that movie did have a few funny moment .
this one is senseless ,
and i am sad
that someone as great as peter seller was in this movie .
not recommended for anyone .
