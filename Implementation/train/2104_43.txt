this movie is not as horrible as most sci-fi channel movie .
i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effect such as close-up of fake blood
that make it very obvious
that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation .
however 
i had thought
that i had seen all the possible lows
that the sci-fi channel could hit .
then i saw this movie.imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock
that is glazed with syrup ?
those are the main alien vampire in this movie .
you can clearly see the finger inside the rubbery sock puppet .
a talking hand comes out of the gut of victim ,
and the vampire
who is on the vampire hunter 's team
can talk to these rubber sock puppet in transylvanian .
how did alien vampire learn transylvanian ?
and is not transylvania in romania ?
so should not they be talking romanian ?
why would some little town have their own language ?
if you can suspend your gag reflex
and get past the talking rubber sock with the finger clearly moving inside the alien ' head ;
then you have to deal with the other alien vampire .
there are the `` leatherface ''
who like to wear the faces of their victim .
then there are the just plain ugly one
that all seem to have a lot of facial scar .
then there are the annoying valley girl and their boyfriend
who are human traitor and sneak into space colony
so that they can sabotage the defense system so that these space vampire can attack.finally ,
if you think
all of the above is funny
and worth a laugh ,
you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv reject
that make up this team of stereotypical angry hero
which are constantly fighting among themselves .
why does almost every sci-fi channel movie have to use lead character
that are annoying 
aasive 
crude 
or just totally unsympathetic ?
i found myself hoping
the talking rubber sock would win .
