as a gamer 
i can not say i like this film .
fact is 
i down right hate it .
i tried to watch it as open minded as possible ,
but
when it gets down to it ,
it feel rather insulting to my social group.to me ,
there are several reason why.1 .
the character seem unnatural .
i have met lot of player 
of all different walk of life .
i do not know
any who act like any of the character in the film .
it is like the producer of the film have taken the worst aspect of the worst stereotype
and put them all into 5 person .
most gamer are rather social person 
some with rather active lives.2 .
the style does not work .
the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film .
an actual documentary on gamer would actually work better .
while it is good looking
( i.e .
cleanly put together ) ,
it is not very good.3 .
the dialogue feel forced 
unnatural .
it also seems to lack any real world context .
gamer swear 
i will admit that ,
but we do not have tourette 's syndrome.4 .
the humor is lacking .
while self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group
and several other group i have encountered ,
this is less self-deprecation ,
and more like toilet humor .
likewise 
a large part of gamer humor is full of in-joke and anecdote 
not toilet humor .
most gamer would balk at and shun anybody
who made such jokes.5 .
the biggest problem to me is basically this : accuracy .
i do not mean rule ,
but instead dynamic .
invariably 
this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamer and the gamer :
dorkness rising 
both of which portray the player as actual person
playing an actual game .
the difference is 
gamer :
the movie presents a situation
where you want to beat the player senseless vs. the gamer ,
where you can say something like :
`` huh 
i know a guy like that ... yep ,
that is definitely like gary . ''
