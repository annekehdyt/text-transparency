i had never heard of this adam sandler movie
until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster .
being an adam sandler fan at the time ,
i rented it .
honestly i could only watch about 30 min .
of it .
it was terrible .
do whatever it takes
to keep this out of the hand of the public .
i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon ,
and i hope it stays that way !
