the plot of 'edison ' was decent 
but one actor in particular ruined the entire film .
justin timberlake ruined the film with every line
he uttered during the movie .
he is by far one of the worst actor i
have ever seen ,
and should face the same fate as the entire f.r.a.t .
squad .
whether it was an emotional scene 
an action scene 
or even a silent scene ,
justin timberlake managed to ruin it .
do not waste your time watching this film .
do not even bother downloading it ,
midget porn would be a much better choice.and justin ,
if you are reading this 
stick to music .
even though you are no good at that ,
you have done a wonderful job tricking person
into thinking
you can actually sing .
