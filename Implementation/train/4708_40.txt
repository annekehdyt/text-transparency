los debutante is the story of two orphaned other
who have moved to santiago from the south after their mother dy .
the confident and streetwise silvio 
the elder other 
gets a job
working for a sleazy strip club 's owner
after taking the naive victor there for his 17th birthday.as silvio blossom under his boss 's tutelage ,
both other get involved with the owner 's sexy and manipulative mistress 
gracia .
as the film unfold 
character are redefined
as we begin to see the subtle and overt way
that each one manipulates the next.the film is well made 
with good cinematography and fast pacing .
it is also pretty sexy 
with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scene .
it uses the now-popular technique of layering different scene from different point of view 
out of chronological sequence .
many person
hate movie like this
because they do not understand
what is going on - memento 
pulp fiction 
reservoir dog ,
and many other good film use this device .
the plot itself is really nothing new ,
there are element of body heat 
pulp fiction ,
and many other good film noir.as the different layer are revealed ,
our understanding of the character and their motivation evolve .
while the plot may be somewhat clich\u00e9 ,
it is also clever and entertaining.i would call it an enjoyable movie ,
worth watching 
but nothing memorable .
i have not seen many film from chile ,
and it is alway interesting to see film noir from other country .
other than that 
rent it
if it is available but do not lose any sleep
if it is not .
