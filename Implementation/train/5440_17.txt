the last time i saw
the movie i was around seven year ,
so my opinion might be jaded over time .
at the time i enjoyed the filming
that switched between cartoon and live action .
at the time i felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life .
also i felt glee
when after captain contagious kidnapped the heroine
( a princess or toy shepherdess )
the table the were turned on him .
unfortunately the producer never decided to transfer this movie to vhs ,
so all i have are twenty year old memory .
i am sure
that
if i saw the movie again
i would consider it corny and sappy ,
but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time .
