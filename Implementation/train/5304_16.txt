caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channel ,
and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing.i really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary ,
but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed .
it also gave me as adult
who attended high school in the 80 's 
a little better insight into what our kid have to contend with these days.the fact
that you do not see the shooting
only adds to the chillness of the plot .
to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend
and come to term with the senseless shooting was at time overwhelming .
and will admit
that i shed quite a few tear throughout.on the whole 
not a movie
that i would seek out to what ,
however i am sure
glad i did see it .
