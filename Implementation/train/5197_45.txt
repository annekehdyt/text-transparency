a family
( mother-patricia clarkson 
father-jake weber 
son-erik per sullivan )
go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter .
they accidentally hit a deer while driving there .
this angers some of the local
-- especially otis
( john speredakos )
and thing slowly
( very slowly )
go wrong.i was expecting the worst
when i started watching this .
the bulk of the reviews for this 
on this site 
are extremely negative .
well ... i disagree .
first off it is not a horror film .
the horror does not even begin until the closing 30 minute .
it plays more like a family drama with horror element
thrown in .
on that level 
it is pretty damn good.first
-- the bad stuff :
the pace is way too slow ;
jake weber is a horrible actor ;
way too many false dream sequence scare ;
the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view
we get of the wendigo at the end
is laughable.the good stuff :
pretty good dramatic script ; clarkson is excellent as the mother ; some great direction with eerie sound effect
which are a little scary ;
a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber
( which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot !
) ; pretty good acting by sullivan
( only 10 at the time ! )
and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.i think
many person are annoyed with this film
because it is being pushed as a horror film
-- which it is not .
so ,
if you can ignore that ,
i think
you might like it .
i am giving it a 7 .
