classic 
highly influential low budget thriller
that gave birth to a horror icon
and launched the career of both director carpenter and star curtis.seemingly unstoppable murderer escape from mental institution and return to his hometown
where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween.halloween
is a film
that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece !
carpenter 's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life
that it must be seen to really be felt !
the direction often consists of such simple element 
shadow 
dark street 
creaking door ,
that it makes even the everyday
setting of a small town neighborhood
truly creepy .
carpenter well-time his suspense and his jolting shock to make them the most effectively startling ,
that in itself is a feat few horror filmmaker ever manage !
plus 
he is wise enough
to give us some truly likable young character and a very scary villain
to keep the tension all the more strong .
highest kudos also go to carpenter 's simple 
yet frighteningly unnerving music score .
in a sense 
halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film !
the cast is excellent .
young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode ,
she is so good
that she would go on to be in a number of other horror film
before eaking into bigger film .
the great donald pleasant does a perfect performance as a myer 's doctor ,
who 's desperate to capture him again .
supporting cast loomis 
sole 
castle ,
and other are good too.so like its own villain ,
halloween is an unstoppable force
that never fails to thrill and chill .
it is a must for all genre fan !
**** out of ****
