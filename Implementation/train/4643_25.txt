hine initially claimed
that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million dollar
but it is painfully obvious
that this was probably produced for $ 750,000
if not considerably less than that .
few set are utilized ,
a number of scene are shot against green screen
and most effect seem incomplete
and amateurish.it is painful to watch .
not so much
because it is poorly directed 
poorly executed and misguided
but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time
and had high hope for this film
despite its relatively modest budget.those of us
who believed in this movie
when it was originally announced
have joined the legion of those spoken of by p.t .
barnum .
