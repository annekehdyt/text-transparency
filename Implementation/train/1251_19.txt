and not in a fun-to-watch way .
it is just bad .
it is shocking that person have posted positive thing about it here .
the story suck 
the acting is bad ,
it is not scary ,
the special effect are not special
-- oh no !
the blackboard has hand coming out of it !
oh gee
-- the mirror turned into water !
the hair 
clothe and makeup in the '50s scene are not accurate ,
and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline
to play the high-school version of himself .
this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff .
i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else ,
but there are better bad one out there
to choose from .
