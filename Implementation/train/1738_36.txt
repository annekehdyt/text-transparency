i watched this movie last night
and hoped for the best
after watching all the cool trailers.even the cover of the dvd looked good.as soon
as i started watching it i was thinking like other `` oh my god what this '' .there were some momant
that were a bit creepy
but then the mood was ruined by stupid music.there was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes.that right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental
and was deceived by the cover art.nothing against the music itself ,
it was just in the wrong part of the movie.whoever edited the film has no clue
what they are doing.the cover showed lightning ,
implying
they were caught in a storm at sea.that
would have been more interesting
but it did not happen .
the acting was not the worst i have ever seen
considering
they are all unknown
and this is obvious their first film.another reason
i was disappointed was the plot made no sense.in the beginning 2 man
saw all of the teen get on a boat ,
then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed
and the other were either her imaginary friend or were ghost i am not sure
because it was very badly portrayed .
whytefox
who wrote a commant on here
claim this
is a true story.he
or she believes in ghost and spirit and says
there is a haunted boat in the area this movie
was filmed.there was no mantion in this movie
about it being a true story.i
have never experienced something like
that personally but am not saying
it is impossible.i guess
if anyone is interested in renting this movie ,
do it at your own risk.if you like amateur student horror film
you may like this .
