this movie was so poorly written
and directed i fell asleep 30 minute through the movie .
the joke in the movie are corny
and even though the plot is interesting at some angle ,
it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous .
if you are 11 or older
you will overlook the writing in the movie
and be disappointed ,
but if you are 10 or younger this is a film
that will capture your attention
and be amazed with all the stunt
( which i might add are poorly done )
and wish you were some warrior to .
the casting in this movie was not very good ,
and the music was very disappointing
because it was like
they were trying to build up the tension
but it did not fit at all .
on a scale of 1-10
( 10 being excellent ,
1 being horrible )
the acting in this movie is a 4. brenda song
is talented in comedy ,
but with this kind of movie 
in some of the more serious scene 
her acting was laughable .
when she made some of her `` fighting '' pose ,
i started laughing out loud .
i think
the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing 
for example 
the part where her enemy turns out to be the person
the evil villain is possesing ,
how her voice turns dark and evil ,
i think
that was incredibly stupid ,
and how wendy 's ( brenda song )
teacher were all her teacher at school
being possessed by monk ,
that was pretty ridiculous to .
so to sumamrize it all 
a disappointing movie ,
but okay if you are 10 or under .
