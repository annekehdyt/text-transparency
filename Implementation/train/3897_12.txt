there is a reason
this went straight
to video- the story is smarmy ,
nick cage play johnny in a sleazy way- sex in church ,
and other scene
that border on tasteless
( like the scene in the laundry room )
taint this movie .
judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay-
but the movie itself with its theme of degradation and revenge are not well done .
but it is a good film for trivia contests-
because so few person saw it .
