a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy ,
whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculpture
made from element from nature .
his work is made of rock 
leaf 
grass 
ice 
etc. ,
that gets blown away
when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field .
thus 
most of goldsworthy 's work do not really last ,
except as photos or film of what they were .
now 
one can argue
that goldsworthy 's work are a reflection of mortality 
or word to that effect ,
but is not it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art .
and at a time when the stereotype about artist is that they are mostly bitter 
pretentious 
often mentally unstable person
who live in decrepit urban setting ,
goldsworthy seems to be the opposite :
a stable 
unpretentious 
family oriented person
who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland
( of course ,
i am sure
those are the same reason
why he is shunned by some person on the art world
who found his work fluffy or superficial ) .
