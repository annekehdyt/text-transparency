to all of yall
who think
1.this was a boring telecast 2.halle berry and denzel washington
did not deserve their oscarsshut the f**k up ! !
this was one of the best academy award show
because 1.it was a moment in history
to have a black yes
`` black actress '' win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sister have been ignored by the academy for many years.to
be honest i had stop watching the academy award
because of a lack of diversity in either the winner or nominees.to me it was nothing but a bunch of white person patting each other in the back.the academy had many chance to vote black actress that were illiant in movie eg alfre woodard 
whoopi goldberg 
diana ross 
mary jean babtise ,
but it did not 2.halle berry deserved
that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actress been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voter yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge ! but it was time black person were accommodated in these award shows.as for mr washington the academy owed him big time
after that unfair loss for malcomx.to all of you
who think
race is not an issue '' probably white person '' in the movie industry ,
well it is many of the most talented black actress around
have either been reduced to stereo typical
made by white person role
of what they think
is a black woman
or are not existence '' angela basset '' .
i do not expect many of the white person to understand any of this
because they never had to deal with any of it.come to think
of it they are the one
who been inflicting it
