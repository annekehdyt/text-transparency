the strange person
living in a town go about their life .
there is the licker a guy
who licks everything 
a dumpster diver
that finds a body
which he takes home to live with him 
a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her 
a guy
who wants to cleanse girl of their wicked way ... offbeat in the extreme ,
this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color .
the monochrome takes the edge off the two step up from home movie feel .
like a troma movie 
this movie is fun in fit
and start but mostly its weird for weird sake
and soon becomes a crashing bore
since one you see
the set ups you can kind of guess
where its going a lot of the time-not alway- but enough
for it not to be fun .
( though i did not see the cleansing coming ) .
worth a shot
if you have nothing else to watch
and you are waiting for the next set of golden girl to come from netflix .
