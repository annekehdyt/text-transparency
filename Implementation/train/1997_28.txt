i had a video of the thing .
and i think
it was my fourth attempt
that i managed to watch the whole film
without drifting off to sleep .
it is slow-moving ,
and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform ,
which may have been revolutionary at the time ,
is now just a great big yawnaroony .
apart from conrad veidt 
the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable ,
and it is only in the action towards the end
that thing get really interesting .
when the water started to spill big-time
it even 
on one occasion 
woke me up.but give the man his due .
no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt .
he does not wedge it between his index and middle finger like the lesser mortal .
he holds it in his finger ,
while showing us the old pearly-own .
there are a few scene in this film
where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background ,
and looks very artistically done .
but it does not say much about this film
if all
that impresses you
is the tobacco smoke .
