this wilfully bizarre adaptation of borge short story is typical cox .
his strong visual sense is 
as usual 
undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast .
the film is definitely in the surreal tradition of bunuel 's mexican period ,
and looks at time like a poor man 's take on lar von trier 's element of crime .
cox 's apparent preference for single takes ,
jump cut ,
and ambient sound recording all work against the film 's effectiveness .
worth a look but ultimately disappointing .
