this is exactly the type of film
that frustrates me the most .
great cast 
great director 
great story potential 
then they ruin it all with a screenplay
that goes nowhere ...
and says nothing
while going there !
there is no depth here whatsoever .
no depth of character 
no depth of plot 
no depth of surprise 
suspense 
or common sense .
we know what is happening ,
we are told
how they plan to fix the problem ,
they fix the problem ,
throw a surprise at us near the end
that fails to generate any suspense ,
then they end the film auptly .
wasted opportunity.on the plus side ,
glenn ford leads a cast of uk
( and one french )
actor
who are all fantastic ,
doing an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing
they were given .
one of the absolute favorites is herbert walton as `` old charlie '' ,
who provides some wonderful bit of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film .
i also thought
the film had a great look
to it ... all shadow and fog ... very film noir in feel.even
though the actor do the best they can
and the directing is enjoyable ,
it still just is not enough for me
to recommend spending the time
to view the film .
there are far better glenn ford movie out there :
the big heat 
gilda 
affair in trinidad 
etc .
