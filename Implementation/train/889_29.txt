generally 
i have found
that
if you do not hear about a movie prior
to seeing it on dvd ,
there is probably a good reason for it .
i had not heard about this movie at all
until i was in a blockbuster the other day
and saw it on a shelf .
since all the good movie had already been rented out
( the one i wanted to see 
anyway ) ,
i figured i would give this one a shot.it is really not much different than other movie in the genre 
such as the single ward or the r.m .
if you are into those type movie ,
you will probably enjoy this.however ,
if you are not a mormon ,
this movie probably will not appeal to you .
there is no way to avoid the overtly religious
( mormon )
message contained within ,
and at time it comes across as sappy and cheesy .
ultimately ,
if you do not fall within the mormon demographic ,
you are probably better off watching something else.admittedly ,
there were some very funny moment in the film ,
but i did not think
that it was enough
to salvage the movie overall .
