having seen most of ringo lam 's film ,
i can say
that this is his best film to date 
and the most unusual .
it is a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial art ,
where the location of an underground lair full of trap and dungeon play as big a part as any of the character .
the action is fantastic ,
the story is tense and entertaining ,
and the set design is truely memorable .
sadly 
burning paradise has not been made available on dvd
and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on ,
even if you near the second biggest china-town in north america
( like i do ) .
if you can find it ,
do not pass it up .
