the concept of the legal gray area in love crime contributes to about 10 % of the movie 's appeal ;
the other 90 % can be attributed to it is flagrant bad-ness .
to say
that sean young 's performance as a so-called district attorney is wooden
is a gross understatemant .
with her bland suit and superfluous hair gel 
young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for man .
why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so
she can arrest cop
who try to pick up on them ?
this hatred is also the only reason
why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer
who gives woman a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie .
watching young go from frigid to full-frontal nudity does little to raise interest ,
but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does .
watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes love crime worth the rental fee ,
but it is all downhill to and from there .
despite her urge to ing patrick bergin 's character to justice ,
her policing skill completely escape her in the thro of her own tired lust and passion .
patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath ;
if it worked in sleeping with the enemy
it sure
as hell can work in this .
but i can not help but wonder
if the noticeable lack of energy young ings to the film conflict with his sliminess .
i am guessing
it does and the result is a `` thriller '' with thrill
that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic .
