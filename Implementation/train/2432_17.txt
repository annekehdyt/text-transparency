the whole does not even come close to the sum of the part .
no problem .
this film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative director of our time
and some really famous name in the cast .
the segment are devised around the same theme 
`` love in paris '' ,
but the resemblance ends there .
actually ,
considering
that the approach to the theme from all these different director takes so many form ,
it is amazing
that we can even feel
we are still watching the same film .
no great effort has been made
to turn it into a comprehensive whole .
this buffet has so many great ingredient ,
i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish .
