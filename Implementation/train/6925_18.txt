as i sat subjected to this televised mediocrity 
i wondered why ?
why did dianne keaton agree to this trash ?
the movie uses meaningless 
contrived plot line to deliver trash to home of thousand .
the movie takes a political agenda to a new level .
the movie was meaningless ,
and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype .
it was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile ,
but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage
that you can not polish a turd .
i hope
that you did not waste your new year 's day
watching another mindless
made for tv movie .
i now know
why the network started airing series on sunday night ,
to rid us of trash !
