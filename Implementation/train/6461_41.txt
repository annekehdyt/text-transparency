10 item or less was made in two week on a shoestring budget by writer/director brad silberling ,
just a little film shot in carson ,
ca
that feel
like the entire story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word .
silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman 
in between his big project 
with spanish actress paz vega ,
and the result is a dialogue between two person from different vantage
who manage to enhance the life of the other.morgan freeman plays himself -
yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor
who has been out of work for four year 
scouting a location for a little 'filler film '
to get back into the flow of thing .
his 'role ' is to be that of a market manager
and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson
where he encounters 
among other 
one scarlet 
the girl at the argumentative 10 item or less checkout line .
not only is scarlet tired of her static job ,
she is also generally angry about her philandering husband
( bobby cannavale ) ,
currently sleeping with scarlet 's lazy co-worker
( anne dudek ) ,
and her lack of ability
to get a decent job elsewhere .
the two pair after a few shared problem and off they go on a 'road trip '
that result in each of the character growing from the presence and life story of the other.it is a simple story ,
simply told ,
but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well .
this is one of those little film about human relationship
where being vulnerable to change and exchange
is the message .
it is well worth viewing ,
and this is a dvd
that has featurette
that are touching 
informative 
and comic - a pleasure to view .
