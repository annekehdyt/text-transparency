it was the tag-line `` in the tradition of american pie ''
that fooled me into renting this movie .
what i got was a piece of junk in the style of jackass 
with the major difference
that
compared to this jackass the movie
seems like a citizen kane.this movie
made me regret
that i rewarded other movie with 1/10 ,
because now i can not go beneath that .
this one makes quite some bad movie
look like cinematic feats.i actually turned it off after 45 minute ,
and that is something
i very rarely do .
but it was just too plain boring 
stupid ,
uninteresting and unnecessary.can not believe
some person actually reward this with 10/10 .
what did your parent do ?
drop you on the head
when you were just a child ?
or was it the very first movie
you ever saw ,
so you got nothing to compare it to ?
are you still a virgin
and are easts all you ever think off ?
something must be wrong 
at least.my advice :
stay clear of this one .
even if your in the mood for a simple movie
that does not require thinking ,
choose something else ,
or you will regret it for sure .
