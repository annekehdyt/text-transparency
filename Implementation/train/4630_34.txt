the wonderful `` z '' channel in los angele showed this pia zadora film about six month or so after `` butterfly '' .
i had such high hope for the actress ,
and
then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film.again ,
it was the 80 's and i got ta tell
you harold robbin 's work had been eclipsed by smarter writer .
jacqueline susann ripped into him
( she hated his way of writing woman ) ,
irwin shaw 's work caught on with many woman ,
and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70 's early 80 's
and then came jackie collin
who made woman stronger and as equal to man in every way in her book 
even more so .
which is why this work smelt .
harold robbin 's work in the 80 's just did not catch on with audience .
pia zadora acting in one of robbin 's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire .
the supporting cast was not a help either.oooooh ...
this was awful to look at then and even 20 more year later ,
it looks even worse .
i had a hope for pia as an actress
and it all got shot to heck
when this was done .
it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress
( although john water casting her in `` hairspray ''
was a spark )
although she has a nice singing voice.hey 
pia ,
wherever you are ...
hairspray may go on tour !
join the show .
you may be the biggest comeback story yet.i
just hope
they burn this film for ya
if you do .
