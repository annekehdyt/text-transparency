the world may have ended .
unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canada 's inability
to make movie
that go beyond the execrable .
maybe it is because all our really good person
( norman jewison 
martin short et al )
go to hollywood . )
in fact it is too bad short was not cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film .
he might have given it some credibility .
the canadian government should realize
-- - and this movie is a magnificent example -- -
that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema .
if the person lapping up these public fund had had to compete ,
they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile .
as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment .
