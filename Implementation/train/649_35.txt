i have read a few of the review and i am kinda sad
that a lot of the story seems glossed over .
its easy to do
because its not a book ,
its a movie and there is only so much
that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere.colm feore does 
at least for a recovering `` f @ g-hag '' like myself 
a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood ' gay man-
but playing sick .
i mean 
the man really can not get much more pale !
though 
you might never know it from the strip down near the ... um ,
end.if you need decrepit ,
there are a few sking movie
you might like.being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic ,
the druggie other { david cubitt } was the trick for me .
i am going to give him cred ,
he grew up quick-
and believe me
that is good .
and 
as an aspiring writer 
moimeme 
i can dig a lot of his insight and overview .
but i am more prosy than poetic.i may be easy to please ,
but i enjoyed it .
a nice story pretty well put together- by canadian 
quelle surprise .
just toed the line of the 'movie of the week 
' missing
it
by not being as drawn out ,
greatly appreciated .
and it was rather cleverly portrayed .
