stephen king movie are a funny thing with me .
i either really love them or i loathe them .
some of the fancier production
( such as desperation and storm of the century )
i did not enjoy .
some of the smaller one 
i really loved .
sleepwalker is one
that i really do enjoy
and watch it regularly.the story revolf around charle brady and his mother mary .
they are sleepwalker ,
shape shifting creature
who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature .
they are immune to the scratch of cat
and whenever they move to a new town ,
lay out trap to catch
and kill the animal .
when they move to their latest town ,
they need to seek out a virgin
and when charle finds one ,
he actually falls for her ,
but his mother needs to feed from her
to keep up her strength .
the story revolf around what will happen with the girl .
will charle spare her or use her
to save his mother.although this story
has overtone of incest
which some may find unappealing
it does actually play a part in the story
and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal 's sake .
like most stephen king story
it is based in a small town with lot of interesting character .
the acting is not the best ,
nor are the special effect 
however 
somehow 
the whole thing tends to 'gel '
and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.for uk reader :
this production has most recently been shown on bbc1 
sci-fi and sky thriller/horror channel .
