i would like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy
and it takes a lot
( ! )
for me to dislike a movie
but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest ,
crappiest movie i have ever seen !
i have no idea
what is wrong with the person
who gave it such a good rating here
( imdb is usually pretty reliable
when it comes to rating )
... the only thing i can imagine is that person must 've voted during one or more conditions:1.
while being shitfaced / stoned out of their mind 2.
they have received hard cash for the vote 3. under gunpointus can not believe
i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .
