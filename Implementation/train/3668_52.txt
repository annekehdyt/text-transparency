in the hollywood west those trail hand were a rough bunch
who
when they came to town 
partied pretty hardy .
after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day
before railroad got to all part of the usa .
the drover
who worked for trail boss gil favor
as played by eric fleming
were no different .
but fleming was a man of all business ,
he had a job
to do
and hired a top crew
to do it .
with the long run of rawhide and the fact
that the regular stayed with it for the most part ,
we got to know all the drover at some point .
a some point story line were focused around all of them ,
though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood 's character rowdy yate ,
the number 2 guy with the herd.clint eastwood 's western image was molded by rawhide ,
it is a shame
that these are not shown more often .
probably because they were done in black and white .
had this been an nbc show ,
this would have been done in color like bonanza
and be running as often
as those show are .
we 'd get to see a lot more of a man
who became a move legend.ironically enough
it was eric fleming
who left the show
before it closed to do film .
he did a few them
and was hoping
the show would give him a bankable movie name .
sadly he was killed on a movie location
doing an action film ,
drowned in a river .
had he
lived
he might have become a name like eastwood's.clint took over as trail boss in the last season
and then the show completed its run .
and he of course became the icon he is today
and not just in the western genre.rawhide was a tough western
who had some tough guy in it .
no frill in this one 
these were working cowboys just doing a job
and battling the element and whatever situation
they were thrown into every year.they
really do not make television series like these any more .
what a pity .
