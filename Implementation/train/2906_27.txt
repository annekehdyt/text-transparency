i am a big fan of low budget horror movie like this ,
but come on !
this has to be the worst piece of monkey s @ #
t i have ever seen !
i ignored the review posted on this site
figuring
that it would fall into my taste in horror ,
but i got bored
and turned it off.let 's see :
the wardrobe :
consisted of cheap cameo outfit and painter outfit from home depot .
the mask were made from what looks like tin foil .
the gore :
the gore was pretty good ,
i must give it that .
but ittenbach 's burning moon was better for a low budget movie .
acting :
was horrible !
i did not mind the dubbing .
i find this humorous like in ittenbach 's `` premutos ''
( great movie ) .
the fighting and action sequence were pi $ $ poor.bottom line :
do not watch any of schnaas 's movie .
there are much better director like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movie of the same gore and subject matter .
check premutos 
house of blood 
schramm and the nekromantiks .
