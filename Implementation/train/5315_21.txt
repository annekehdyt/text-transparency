that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie .
cleveland is the star ,
i have been there
and never saw the city look this good .
beautiful river and cityscapes.this movie move ahead at such a pace
they hope
you will not notice the lack of real world relevance .
person running around and shooting gun
without any consequence .
for example 
there is a shoot out at rob lowe 's character 's house- two car are stolen ,
and yet the cop do not show up there till much later in the movie .
murder for hire never looked
so implausible.whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movie countless stray bullet .
many of the actor in this movie are so much better than this .
i check the date of the movie just to make sure
it was not written during the writer strike
but alas this was not the case .
this movie is currently in rotation on universal 's hd channel-
unless you want to drool of over lowe
there is no reason to watch it .
