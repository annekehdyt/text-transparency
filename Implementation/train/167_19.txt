a young cat try to steal back his other soul from death
but only gets half of it
and then has to go adventuring to get the other half ... or maybe not .
frankly i am not sure what happens in this film
which is full of very strange 
very surreal image some of which parent might find disturbing ,
( ie.the cat slicing off part of a pig
who is traveling with them and the frying it like bacon
which all three eat )
.this is a very strange film
that some have likened to hello kitty on acid ,
i think its more like hello kitty as done by dali .
( certainly this is more alive than destino
which was directly based on his work )
.if your up for a very off beat film
that will challenge your perception of thing
then see this movie .
just be ready for some very strange image
that will be burned into your memory forever .
