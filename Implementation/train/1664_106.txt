how they got al pacino to play in this movie
is beyond me .
this movie is absolutely terrible .
i discovered ,
after reading some of the other review ,
that a couple of person actually enjoyed this film ,
which deeply puzzle me ,
because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution .
it is not just that it is a bad movie 
with a lame plot and overall strangeness
that is extremely unpleasant ,
but it seems
as if the filmmaker were either mentally retarded
( which is a very possible explanation
as to why this movie suck like it does ,
though it probably still suck even compared to other film
made by retard )
or deliberately made every illogical decision
to make this movie suck as much as possible .
for example 
we see donald sutherland running around with a huge 
fat ugly mole on his face .
he does not normally have a mole .
the mole does not add to his character .
it is extremely ugly and distracting .
it is not like robert de niro 's mole ;
it is much worse .
why the hell has he got that mole ?
it is as
if the filmmaker just said ,
`` let 's see 
how could we make this movie even worse
than it already is ?
i know ,
let 's give mr. sutherland a giant 
ugly-ass mole right on his face .
`` another example of the filmmaker ' stupidity is the character ned .
we see 
for the first three-quarter of the movie 
young ned .
at one point 
`` six month later '' appears on the screen .
we see ned again ,
and it is 
of course 
the same actor
playing the boy .
five minute later 
`` three week later '' appears on the screen ,
and all of a sudden we have got a different actor
playing as the now older ned .
what 
do they think
we are idiot ?
good god !
again 
it is like the filmmaker are saying ,
`` how can we possibly make it any worse ?
i do not think
we can ... oh wait !
i just had a terrible idea ! ''
i know
a kid does not grow much in half a year ,
which is fine ,
but he at least grow more
than he does in three week .
just do not get another actor to play ned ,
or at least get him to play the five minute
when he is three week younger .
furthermore 
the kid
who plays the `` older '' ned
does not look any older than `` young '' ned .
as a matter of fact 
he just looks completely different 
much skinnier 
and no taller or older than the original actor ,
which is very confusing ,
as i 
like any rational human being ,
thought at first
that it was a new and different character.what ,
did the first kid die
while they were filming the movie ?
because he was in it for the first hour and a half ,
and then all of a sudden 
three week later 
the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrel is playing ned for the last five minute of the movie .
and even if the original actor did die ,
the filmmaker should have at least gotten an actor
who looks like him to play the remainder of his role ,
and re-shoot the measly five minute of `` six month later '' scene .
better yet 
just scrap the movie completely ,
never finish it
and never release ,
never even tell anybody about it ,
because by that point they should have realized that their movie suck and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed
in making one of the worst movie of all time.i am
not saying
that this movie is so bad you should not watch it ;
it is so bad
that you should watch it ,
just to see how badly it suck .
it is terrible 
terrible .
