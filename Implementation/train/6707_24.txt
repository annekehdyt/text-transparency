although misty ayer
( burlesque stripper )
is certainly attractive as the blonde lead ,
this flick is just an excuse
to let her strip down to her underwear a few time
( no nudity in 1954
when this film was made ;
not 1965 )
.the guy
who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott and costello .
most of the other woman are unattractive ,
and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way.a 2/10 .
ms. ayer has a curvacious physique ,
but you can not judge any acting talent
because the entire film is post-dubbed .
some of these `` exploitation film '' ,
usually made later than this one ,
are interesting in some way ,
but this is really a bore fest .
sid melton
( make room for daddy )
directed .
there are some samurai-like facial expression and interesting apartment ,
but there is really nothing here .
