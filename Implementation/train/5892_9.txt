though cher and cage are the focal point of this story ,
gardenia and dukakis are good counterpart for them- this is where loretta and ronny will be in 50 years- still in love .
the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john mahoney-
it shows a real slice of life .
though i saw this long ago- i am glad
it finally catapulted cage to the place
where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent .
from the music to the scene at the opera to the kitchen table
arguments- this is a very entertaining movie .
