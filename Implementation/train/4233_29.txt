that movie was awesome !
i can not get over it is song .
i think
i am a little too old for musical ,
but that movie deserves some credit here ,
guy !
my especial favorite was jack wild .
me ,
being a british actor lover ,
you can not restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced 
young man .
i never knew
that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen !
he looks like an eleven- year old .
he is short ,
that is what helps .
try posting up your reply 
fellow poster ,
so i can relate to your experience .
oh 
and about oliver reed ,
that guy 
bill sike ,
i think
that drone look is really familiar .
