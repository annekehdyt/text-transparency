this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama .
my all-time favourite actor 
robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system 
kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime 
and homicidal psychosis .
the teen are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotype ,
and the eventual message of this film makes episode of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison .
but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie ,
building the fear and paranoia by degree ,
as well as the feel of the whole california setting .
the car are really great as well 
as i recall .
i give this film a 10 ,
and i defy anyone to watch this film
and not enjoy every minute .
remember ,
just
because it is made-for-television does
not mean it is not great art .
