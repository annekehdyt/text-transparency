mystery man is one of those movie
that gets funnier over time .
there is a naive innocence and `` niceness '' to the character .
it has become part of our family `` culture 
''
and we quote the character often .
it is my favorite film of the last two year .
my kid are 13 and 11
and we all three love this film .
great acting and comedy .
we love galaxy quest and monty python flick too .
okay 
we are not talking intellectual here ,
just family bonding !
