i am biased toward any movie
that paints a luxuriant picture of italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world .
unfortunately the movie was rather short 
unusually so for a period piece 
and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect .
however 
the excellent story makes up for it .
the four lady embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problem on their mind .
over the course of the movie 
they realize their problem
and begin fixing them .
they believe
san salvatore 
the castle
they stay in ,
has an enchanting effect on person .
`` it is a tub of love 
''
says lottie wilkin .
you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant
as the italian seaside works its magic on them.all their problem
and their solution are plausible .
the actress were great .
the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale .
all in all 
a 10/10 movie for me .
