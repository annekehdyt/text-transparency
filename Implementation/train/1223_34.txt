i understand
that paramount wanted to film this with the rodger and hart score ,
but could not work out the copyright problem 
so burke and van heusen
who wrote the between them the most song for bing crosby
contributed a very nice score.i read leonard maltin
saying
that this movie 
`` fit crosby like a glove '' and i could not have put it better .
no 
it is not mark twain 's satire ,
it is a bing crosby film
and in 1949 crosby was the most bankable star in hollywood .
for once paramount used technicolor and rhonda fleming was never lovelier on the screen .
this was a woman
that technicolor was invented for.william bendix 's brooklyn origins kinda stand out ,
but it is to a good comic effect .
the trio of crosby 
bendix 
and sir cedric hardwicke have a rollicking good time
with busy doing nothing .
bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical number
with if you stub your toe on the moon.the third song
he sings once
and for always by himself and with rhonda fleming .
that song was nominated for best song ,
but lost to baby it is cold outside .
nice also that bing managed to record the score for decca with rhonda fleming and bendix and hardwicke.one thing
i like about this film is that it shows crosby 's comic talent
without bob hope .
i like the road pictures ,
but bing was a comic talent
onto himself and this film better demonstrate
than any other.this is crosby at the top of his game .
