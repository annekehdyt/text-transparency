the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie
told through a simple story .
even though a little dated ,
it deserves a place in the list of disney classic.it is not among disney 's top work ,
but is satisfying .
one of disney 's most `` simple '' work 
yes ,
but keeps a certain magic and enchantment
( which old disney is well known for ) .
this was an important movie
because it saved disney from a delicate situation .
if this was a failure ,
there would not be any more disney animated classic .
`` cinderella '' is somehow like a return to disney 's 1st animated classic
( `` snow white and the seven dwarf '' )
because it ings back the fairy tale genre .
it is not clear where the story takes place ,
but i suppose it is somewhere in france
because this is based in a tale by charle perrault.there
are plenty of likable character 
such as cinderella 
the prince 
bruno
( the dog ) ,
jaque and gus
( the two main mice ) ,
the fairy godmother
( for a fairy
she sure
is funny ) ,
the bird 
the king and the grand duke.jaque is very smart and amusing .
i love his voice .
really has that mouse-like quality .
gus might not be that smart ,
but he is humorous.the king is hilarious ,
but i think
that what makes him so funny is his short temper .
the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too .
they are two of my favorite character in this film
and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney .
no doubt
that prince philip from `` sleeping beauty '' was inspired on this prince ,
because they are very similar-looking.on the other hand ,
lady tremaine
( the stepmother )
is not supposed to be likable
because she is cold 
jealous 
bitter and cruel .
her daughter
( anastacia and drizella )
are not much better than her .
however 
the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughter .
cinderella 
the main character 
has nothing to do with them .
cinderella is gentle 
kind 
pretty and lovable .
by the way 
i think
her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one
given by the fairy godmother.lucifer
( the cat )
is hilariously malicious .
the way
he walks ,
sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial
expression make him funny .
ironically he is very much like the stepmother
when it comes to personality .
he always agrees with the stepmother 's attitude towards cinderella .
lucifer has the right name for him
because he is such a devilish and mean cat .
yet 
there is nothing annoying about him.the soundtrack is simple but pleasant 
although not among disney 's best .
the best song in this movie is `` bibiddi bobiddi boo '' .there are plenty of well
known talented voice actor in this 
such as jame macdonald 
marion darlington 
eleanor audley 
verna felton and luis van rooten.despite
being simple-looking ,
the movie has good artwork ,
as well as its nice detail ,
although never something `` out-of-this-world '' .
however 
the king 's palace is a spectacular masterpiece ,
being truly majestic and colossal .
