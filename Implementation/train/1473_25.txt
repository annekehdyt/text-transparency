i read somewhere
where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir 
`` criss cross . ''
i found the latter to be disappointing
but it was still better than this film .
this movie is a `` neo-noir ''
since it is modern-day
and it is in color ,
two thing
that purist would make it be disqualified for film noir status .
the biggest negative to it 
however 
was not the cinematography
( that was fine )
but the muddled storyline .
hey 
some of '40 dashiell hammett story were similar
but i did not care for some of those either .
the filmmaker here did not help the situation by placing flashback into the story
what seemed like every three minute .
no wonder it was the keep up with this story .
it was ridiculous !
what happens is that by the 45-minute mark ,
their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore .
i know i did not .
