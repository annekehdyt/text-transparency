going into this movie
you know
that this is movie has six lab technician in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac .
so right away you are guessing
who will live and who will die .
the survivor end up being exactly
who you would expect them to be ,
so no point for plot twist there.and
if you are not sure
if this is a b-movie or a movie
that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story 
william devane plays a part :
instant b-movie status.the movie is promising in the beginning .
at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla
who is becoming increasingly violent .
oooh 
foreboding .
the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again .
great special effect .
same thing
when they make bacon invisible.there
are a couple of bare east 
a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing
to give this movie an r-rating
that
it really did not need.for a thriller there
were not really any surprise ,
except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer ,
which is more of a 'whaaaa ? '
ok 
there is one surprise .
that is when caine
( bacon )
comes back one last time in the elevator shaft .
it was a surprise but
only because you are yelling at tv 
'noooo !
you are dead already !
end the movie ! '
speaking of yelling at the tv ,
that is all i did for the last 25 minute or so .
'put on your f # @ % ing goggle ! '
instead of putting their infrared goggle on so
that they can see him ,
they try every other trick in the book
( fire extinguisher 
sprinkler system ... )
.the story really lost it at the end .
but the special effect were good ;
that is the only reason
i give it a 2/10 .
