just when you thought
it was safe to go back into the water ... another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat ,
let loose by another one of those facility
conducting mad science .
gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research ,
accidentally releasing a baby crocodile
which is evolving at an accelerating rate.b-movie cast
add a deal of fun to this run of the mill `` genetic mistake monster movie '' .
costa mandylor evokes mick dundee 
aussie accent 
hat 
big ass knife 
the work 
as a croc specialist
hired by gereco executive joanna pacula
( ..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive
who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent person ) .
charle napier is the local sheriff
whose town is in danger
and jane longenecker is his hot daughter ,
who work at the animal shelter .
soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker 's love interest 
a local artist
who welds sculpture
( ..his other is a victim of the croc ) .
of course 
this skill will come in mighty handy
when our hero set up a created trap for the croc ,
hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.the croc itself is never the least bit convincing
as it rampages through a reserve
looking for food 
the special effect of a low grade variety .
in regard to roger corman production dealing with renegade dino-monster 
i stick with carnosaur .
the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing
on it is hind leg 
often upright
as it pursues potential victim .
i felt mandylor
and the filmmaker were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter ,
and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails .
borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen .
as expected ,
pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion
( ..gulp ) .
