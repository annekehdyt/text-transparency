anyone
who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought
to have their head examined .
we have the submissive 
heroin-addicted 
part-time hooker wife with laceration all over her body ,
laceration received from repeated
beating by an abusive son .
now 
she is squirting east milk all over the kitchen floor ,
the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hand in running water .
we have the husband
who starts out by patronizing a prostitute
who just happens to be his daughter
( she is upset with him
because he came too quickly )
and ends by murdering his female colleague ,
having sex with her corpse ,
and then chopping her up .
we have the kid
who is relentlessly bullied by his classmate
and who comes home and beats his mom .
you see ,
it is all circular .
deep 
huh ?
the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son 's tormentor .
it is a good thing
this turkey was shot on video
because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be .
if that guy
who thinks artist
ought to be interested in this slop
is really serious ,
no wonder most person think
artist are insane .
we saw this lousy movie ,
then put on `` zero woman 
the accused . ''
oh my god 
it was a tossup as to which one was worse .
what is going on in japan these day ?
sick 
sick 
sick .
