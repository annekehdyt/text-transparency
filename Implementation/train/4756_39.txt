oh dear ...
as an englishman 
and a small part welsh 
a fan of anthony hopkin ' work in the industry ... .. to date ,
i am truly disappointed .
you see i am a nobody ,
who hoped for better .
so my comment are as 'straw in the wind ' .
but ,
that is the point is not it ?
- i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work .
i 
a full member of the great unwashed 
go to see a movie
to be transported to another place .
to yes 
suspend belief for a ief period .
but not to enter a state of total disbelief.had this
been by an unknown author and director ,
i would guess
that this 'production ' would have been castigated into oblivion .
unfortunately 
its not 
and i was left wide eyed and confused .
having seen some of the rave review
given this work i am faintly worried ... .perhaps its
that i try ,
without prejudice ,
to view each movie on its own merit .
regardless of author 
director 
studio or even the notoriety of the content.my advice ,
as many before me :
do not write
and direct the same production .
it is fraught with danger .
movie need to be moderated
to retain a semblance of credibility.as
they say in school report `` could and can do better ... ''
