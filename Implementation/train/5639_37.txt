diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle
and we both agreed
that of the pastiche movie it was head
and shoulder above the rest .
i say
that
because we were entranced by the ief ,
five to ten minute segment
that composed the film and the fact
that this film had a theme around
which each piece was composed and of course
that theme was love in its many forms.ostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisment
thus giving a particular flavour to each segment .
having only been in paris several time ,
i was not knowledgeable enough
to readily recognize the location
but i am sure
european and particularly french person could easily recognize the city 's location .
in any event 
the viewer is immediumtely pulled into each story
because of their production excellence so these city location fade into in-consequence.the film move quickly
and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario
while the new one is on the screen .
the story themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense ,
they are subtle
and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life
without the medium swath
that buries so much of life 's beauty under the nearest dung heap
just to sell 
sell .
sell ... go with someone
you care for and allow this magical little film
to bathe you like a spa treatment
and
when you leave my guess
is you
will feel renewed .
