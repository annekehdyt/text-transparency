spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta .
the story is no worse than any number of gangster flick ,
but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii 
or goodfella .
it is not in the same league.but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian american swaggering around
dropping bad gangsta line in an even worse fake u'an accent .
pacino would have been great
if they could just have dubbed him .
i was looking forward to see aaham and loggia ,
but their steenky accent spoiled the fun.ah well ,
the script are not too hot either .
don corleone would have made this disappear five minute after meeting him 
smiling and patting him on the back all the while .
