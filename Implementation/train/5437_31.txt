the original boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick .
it was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind .
the third instalment in this series 
return of the boogeyman 
on the other hand 
is simply atrocious .
it consists of two thing .
firstly 
cheap and lifeless new footage .
secondly 
load of recycled bit from the first movie .
the new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way ,
simply incredibly tedious .
this footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort .
it serves as a framing device for the endless clip from the first
( and possibly second ) movie .
and boy 
do they milk those clip from the earlier film ;
sometimes reusing sequence over and over again .
the only new addition to these part is a voice
over that pointlessly describes exactly
what we can see with our own eye .
the whole experience
of watching this is truly mind-numbing.return of the boogeyman
is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick ;
the kind
that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way .
i want to keep this review ief and to the point
because this film deserves no more .
there is nothing here of value at all .
this is worthless .
