the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing 
dealing with espionage and romance
but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interlude showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell 
abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra ,
featuring ziggy elman 
buddy rich and frank sinatra .
red skelton share top billing with powell ,
and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minute ,
although skelton is more effective when he ,
if it can be believed ,
perform as powell 's love interest ,
with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film 's humor as the dancer 's companion .
the technical illiance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within
which buddy rich contributes his drumming skill ,
and which must be viewed several time
in order to permit one 's eathing
to catch up with her precision .
director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along
despite the rather disjointed script
with which he must deal ,
and permits powell 's cotangent impossibility to rule the affair ,
as is appropriate .
