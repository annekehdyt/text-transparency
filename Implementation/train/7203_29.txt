nichola walker is paul 
the local town reverand
who 's married to martha
( ally sheedy ) ,
but also is a habitual womanizer
and decide to fake his own death
to run away with his current affair 
veronica
( dara tomanovich ) .
however in so doing ,
he gets a bout of amnesia
( hence the name of the film ) .
sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot
who pines for the good reverand in a shade of `` misery '' type of way .
it is sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this .
not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator .
in a film
billed as a 'black comedy ' ,
one has to ing both element into said movie .
while this does ing the former in spade ,
it sadly contains none of the latter .
furthermore you can not emphasize with any of the character and as thus ,
have absolutely no vested interest in them .
technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.eye candy :
dara tomanovich gets topless ;
sally kirkland also shows some skin my grade :
