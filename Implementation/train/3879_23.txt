unless you are geeky film student
who has to see everything ,
this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment ,
but it will also make you angry beyond belief.there might be a story worth
telling somewhere inside ,
but hopkin decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layer of apparently random audio video microcut ,
making the viewer 's patience run thin after a very short while.why would someone like hopkin choose such a heavy 
most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script 
first score and third film can by anyone guess .
maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time
until it became unrecognizable as what it became ,
not even for himself .
the result proves
that he has by far not enough experience or skill
to achieve the desired result.even the weirdest carpenter and lynch film ,
to name just two uncoventional filmmaker ,
had 90 % more coherence 
95 % less character and 99 % more story flow.sir anthony you aimed for the star ,
but unfortunately missed by a couple of light year .
please stick to acting ,
in that department you are a unequaled giant
and nobody should ask more from you ,
not even yourself !
