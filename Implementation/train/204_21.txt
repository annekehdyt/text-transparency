the 60\u00b4s is a well balanced mini series between historical fact and a good plot .
in four delivery 
we follow a north american family 
with 3 member .
but we do not only see them .
we also follow the story of several character as a black reverend 
an extremist student leader 
and a soldier in vietnam .
the filmography is just extraordinary .
in the first chapter 
we see some shot of the vietnam war 
in between the scene .
the next chapter 
does not start where the last one finished ,
it starts some time after ,
giving us a little mystery on what happened .
in general 
the 60\u00b4s mini series 
is a must see 
not only for hippie fanatic ,
but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic .
