gung ho is one of those movie
that you will want to see over and over again .
michael keaton is put in charge
of wooing a japanese car company
to come to his town
thus creating job for the resident of hadleyville .
what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another .
the two culture clash and it is up to keaton to hold thing together .
look for great performance from keaton 
gedde watanabe 
george wendt 
mimi roger 
john turturro 
soh yamamura and sab shimomo .
all are perfectly cast .
do not be fooled by the low number rating .
this is a 7.5 in my book .
it is interesting to note
that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon .
yes 
there is a real hadleyville but in oregon .
