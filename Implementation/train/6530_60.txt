** contains spoiler ** the truly exquisite sean young
( who in some scene ,
with her hair poofed up ,
looks something like elizabeth taylor )
is striking in her opening moment in this film .
sitting in the back of a police car waiting
to signal a bust ,
her face and body are tense and distracted .
unfortunately ,
once the bust is over young 's strained demeanor
never change .
this is one fatally inhibited actress.one has only to compare young to the performer
playing her coworker and best friend 
arnetia walker 
to grasp what is missing in young .
walker is open 
emotional 
and at ease at all time ...
in that there is no apparent barrier
between what she may be feeling and her expression of it .
she is an open book .
young 
on the other hand 
acts in the skittish 
self-conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were
they suddenly thrown into starring in a film .
basically 
she does not have a clue.with this major void looming at the center of the movie ,
we are left
to ponder the implausiblity of the story .
for instance ,
after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal
she is trailing
and locked in a closet ,
she eaks the door down
when left alone .
granted 
she is dressed only in a a and panty ,
but in a similar situation 
with a psycho captor due to return any moment ,
would you head for the door ...
or take the time
to go through his dresser ,
take out some clothe
and get dressed ?
i would guess
that this and other scene are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotion miss young 's character is experiencing ,
but young can not convey this type of complexity.there are a few affecting moment in the film 
such as the short police interview with the criminal 's past victim ,
but overall this is an aimless endeavor .
it is too bad miss young was replaced
while filming the pair of comic book style film
that might have exploited her limitation with some humor
( batman and dick tracy ) ,
because her floundering
while attempting to play actual person
is oddly touching .
watching miss young try to act ,
at least in this `` thriller '' 
is a sad spectacle .
