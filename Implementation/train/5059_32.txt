this has some excellent spot
but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot .
it is another sailor on leave film 
zippier than astaire 's 'follow the fleet ' but not as good as 'on the town ' .
kathryn grayson is bland but kelly and sinatra work well together .
their 'if you knew susie ' number is hilarious
as they make up the song
as they sing it .
'i begged her ' is also fun with sinatra showing
how adept he was at hoofing .
sinatra 's solo song are dull
and seem to be inserted
to show off his singing rather than as part of the story .
fortunately there are accomplished supporting actor like grady sutton 
rags ragland 
carlos ramirez and pamela britton and an unlikely but impertubable jose iturbi as himself ,
to keep one watching.kelly is the star of the film ,
although third billed
and it is interesting to see him interact with child ,
which astaire never did .
dean stockwell plays a child
who wants to be in the navy and latch on to the kelly character .
he also visit a school resulting
in him telling the child a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian
( !
) navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse .
in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a sublimely grave
faced little girl 
sharon mcmanus ,
that is entrancing and sweet .
very pleasant then but a bit too long .
a taster of better musical to come .
