wow ... i
mean wow this has got to be one of the best story 's i
have ever had the chance to read/watch .
we all know this famous story .
two martial artist 
a man and his son 
go to train in the forbidden cursed spring
and while ignoring their warning
they both fall in a spring each .
the dad 
genma 
the spring of drowned panda .
and 16 year old ranma 
the spring of drowned girl .
now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very
being titled to the spring
they landed in .
crazy enough yet ?
no 
that just the beginning .
as if being one of the strongest teenager to ever exist
who turns into a female
was not enough ,
ranma has to deal with crazed martial art teacher and hundred of insane art style 
an insane high school principle 
opponent right and left
who have a score
to settle with ranma wither
it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for `` stealling '' their loved one .
and speaking of loved one ,
i have lost track
of how many time a boy or a girl has fallen in love with ranma .
and not once has it been his fianc\u00e9e 
akane .
and that just from the first few chapters/episode of the series.the story itself is amazing .
i have never come across something so crazy 
so bizarre ,
so ...
so ... out of this world
and yet its so down to earth and believable ... i can not even describe it to its fullest .
its just a charming story
that so easy to get into .
what i like about it is the humor .
not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga ,
and it does not have to try any of the stunt you would catch in simpson 's or something of the sort .
i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end .
another thing is the character .
ranma 
you would think
making him too strong would be a set back but nooo ... with every little problem
the story throw at him he is doing his best just to survive half the time
and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem
but when worst comes to worst
he can be a calculating genius .
and to think 
of the hundred of pervert in the show 
ranma
who hates the idea of pervert all together
is considered by everyone in his town 
more so by akane 
the worst pervert to ever live .
his father genma 
you would think
the father character would blend in to the background right ?
correct !
but whenever he does have some spotlight ...
he just gives you more reason to hate him yet at the same love him !
you think
you know
the worst dad ever from an anime ?
you have not met genma .
ryoga 
probably one of ranma 's greatest rival and my favorite character
( next to ranma ) ...
and probably one of the only person
he can
actually stand .
most likely the strongest character in the series
but has two fault ,
one is his curse
that turns him into a baby pig
but his worst fault ... is his lack of sense in direction !
then we have ... you know ,
i could spend hour at the computer
explaining all the character ,
the story 's 
everything positive about it
but that would be just pointless.check out the series
if
you have not 
now !
you will not regret it !
though i would advise checking the comic out first .
i like the anime 
but i have had some trouble
getting the series at a good price .
and a small nitpick 
the humor does not seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga .
i think
partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me .
but either way 
its a win win !
10/10 !
