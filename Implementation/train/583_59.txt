acting was weak ,
but in a horror flick 
i can live with that
if the story is good .
it was not .
the initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy
to exploit most person 's adoration of kid .
ok 
fine .
fast forward to the `` place in the country ''
where they will recover emotionally .
i like the revelation of the ghost .
ok 
cool
-- this will be a supernatural kinda horror story ,
with rotting thing partly in our world
partly in ... where ever .
then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cat and bird
-- is there an evil force
trying to attack them directly ?
is there an evil force
trying to attack them indirectly
-- make person do awful thing
they would not really do ?
oh 
wait 
no 
maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber
where ambient discord can reverberate into murder ?
ok 
hold on
-- maybe it is really just one little mentally tangled `` delbert '' -style redneck boy
who misses his mommy
and is on some kind of spree like a k-tel norman bates knock off ?
oh 
yeah
-- extra point off :
the only black character seems to be the grandson of an `` our gang '' pullman porter .
the actor plays it as straight
as he can given the crummy dialogue ,
but the fact is 
his purpose is `` y'all done betta get outa heah 
boss ! ''
at least they wrote him smart enough to gtf outta there .
the bit with the little girl
being silenced
and pulled away
was definitely creepy ,
as was the chick in the shower .
those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbit in this movie .
the problem is that they are combined in disharmonious way 
like a bite of steak 
a bite of chocolate and a bite of a gummi bear .
each is great on
it is own 
but mixed up ?
bleah !
such potential .
wasted .
