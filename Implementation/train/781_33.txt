i doubt
jigsaw was hip even at the time 
the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery
being a patently obvious attempt
to grab a young audience of the era
without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixty counterculture .
the dated aspect aside 
jigsaw suffer from many problem ,
including overwrought acting 
silly and stilted dialogue 
lsd flashback
that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 second 
a failure
to create any true suspense
even though the actual plot is 
on paper 
a great vehicle
to do just that ,
and an ending
that is so trite and predictable
( not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television show )
that the climax is actually an anti-climax .
if it was a better movie ,
we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few thing
where it would help enjoyment ,
but the weakness are so glaring
they only serve to highlight the improbability viewer might otherwise overlook .
i saw jigsaw on television
and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time
to kill somebody 's insomnia
rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out .
at very best 
a three out of 10 .
