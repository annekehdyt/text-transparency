this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind 
tsui hark .
it is one of a few movie
that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow 's shaolin soccer .
from the moment
the movie started ,
there was astronishing backdrop at every edge
which weredeplicted with superb style .
if you are a science fiction or chinese martial art `` geek '' ,
you will love the excessive amount of many 3d effect and realistic computer generated weapon .
there 
comes a fine performance
( as always )
from ekin cheung
who plays `` sky king '' .
he teams up with loui koo
( red )
who i was very impressed by his flexible `` wing ''
which deflected incoming attack .
the fighting movement of these actor were proficient in every way .
not only is the action superb
but the has a somewhat complex storyline .
many criticiser of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just `` shoved in random bit of deise ''
and even describe as `` the legend of poo '' .
however 
the viewer can not rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoon
to understand this movie .
other
who are famarialy with `` wu xia '' movie
will have a better appoach .
in due respect .
there can be one weakness
that could be foreseen .
the blow
that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene
could of been more substantially and devastiingly made.in spite of all this ,
its a must see .
