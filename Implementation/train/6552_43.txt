gillian anderson is an arrogant 
driven 
career woman
who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun .
after a stupid accident in the countryside 
they are utally attacked .
after recovering ,
and after a chance meeting with one of the attacker 
their thought turn to that of revenge ... i thought
`` straighthead '' was terrible .
violent 
utal 
misogynistic and unpleasant .
if i did not dislike the phrase a great deal i would call `` straighthead '' a video nasty .
certainly it was the kind of film
that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark day of the 1980 's .
frankly i do not know
how `` straighthead '' got a cinema release.i am not a prude .
i do not mind sex and violence in the movie ,
but they have to be married to a movie with a ) a good plot or b )
good characterisation or c )
preferably both .
`` straighthead '' had neither .
no progression in the plot or the character
and too much left unexplained and unsaid .
luckily `` straighthead '' went nowhere fast .
it was only 80 minute long.it was a shame ,
because there was the germ of an interesting film here ,
with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third .
how often do i say this ,
but it could have been good if it had been done properly .
what a shame .
i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer ,
but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film .
she 
especially 
is very underrated
( and is still particularly fit )
.if you want to see a good british revenge movie 
rent or buy shane meadow ' `` dead man 's shoe '' .
it is a little masterpiece .
last weekend i should have seen his `` this is england '' instead .
ce sera sera ...
