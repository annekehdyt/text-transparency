sorry ,
but aside from kim basinger doing a good job
acting scared ,
this was one of the worst thriller i have seen in awhile .
logic is thrown out
as 4 young guy terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall
then shoot a security guard .
yet no one seems to notice .
then 
instead of screaming
for help or racing back to the mall ,
she drives off
and ends up in the middle of the wood with the guy in hot pursuit .
i can not even describe
how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thug ,
carrying a red toolbox ,
screaming for god
to come help her ,
and then having sex with one of them
after utally killing the other .
please trust me 
this is bad and a bit tasteless as well .
