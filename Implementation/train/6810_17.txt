reason to watch the movie:1 )
bo derek at 16 look good and occasionally gets naked .
she does a pretty good job
playing an immature 
insecure 16 year old beauty 
in fact2 )
many shot of a pretty greek islandbut:1 )
peter hooten turn in the worst performance by an actor
since brutus played caeser 's friend in `` roman senate proceedings of march 15 . ''
he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow .
turn down the volume
whenever he speaks .
preferably all the way down2 )
bo 's fantasy are sadly tame 
especially by today 's standard .
a few turn in the bath and as a fully clothed model3 )
the plot is skimpier than bo 's costume
