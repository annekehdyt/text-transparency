this movie is one of my favorite
because it makes me think
of all the choice i have made
and how my life would change
if my choice had been different .
it plays right into the `` multiple universe
`` theory.the only thing
that does not ring true
is how larry burrow
( jame belushi )
has such a hard time understanding
what is going on ,
that everything has changed .
