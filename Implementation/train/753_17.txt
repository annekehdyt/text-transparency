i watched it subtitled
as it was in russian ,
but really enjoyed it .
the main character sasha was born cursed 
with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body .
he lived his whole life unhappy
because he was different
and because anger caused him to do deadly thing .
when sasha finally found love in a young woman
named katya
everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle .
there was a fair amount of gore ,
but not too much for the weak stomached.not for person
who like the regular old hollywood movie ,
but for those
who enjoy independent film .
kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film .
