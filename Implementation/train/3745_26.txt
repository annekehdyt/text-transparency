i picked up this movie in the hope
it would be similar to the hilarious `` the gamer '' by dead gentleman production
( which is highly recommendable 
by the way ) .
boy 
what a disappointment !
the movie is shot in this fake documentary style
made famous by the office
but it fails to deliver .
the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing .
true 
it can be funny to use every singe clich\u00e9 there is about role playing game ,
but here it is done in such a way
that it becomes extremely predictable .
already at the beginning of each scene
you know
what the `` joke '' will be about .
but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top .
there is no subtlety in this movie ,
if there would be caption `` laugh now '' or a cheap 80s-style fake-laughter track
it would not make much difference .
with some scene you can not help to think `` yea ,
i get why
they thought
this would be funny ''
but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke .
