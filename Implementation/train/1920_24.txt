everything a musical comedy should be .
gene kelly
( as joe brady )
does not miss a step ,
and frank sinatra
( as clarence doolittle )
does not miss a note .
scene with them together are very good ,
showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot .
sinatra 's `` i fall in love too easily '' is an indication of his then and future best .
kelly 's `` mexican hat dance '' with a young mexican girl is delightful .
kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor .
and there is a bushel of truly funny line 
like :
`` you think
the navy takes dope ?
`` ; `` you think
anybody sing a sailor to sleep ?
`` ; and ,
`` we got in a little trouble ,
we picked up a little kid . ''
a thoroughly enjoyable movie 
just the thing
for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii .
