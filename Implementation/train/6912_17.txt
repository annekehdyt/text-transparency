this little film had long been on my `` keeper '' list .
do person realize
how stressed out 
menopausal 
emotionally abused woman
( as well as the mentally retarded )
were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ? ? ! !
all of the pious uptight christian attitude of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feeling
that would allow us to emace suffering soul ,
let alone explore what it means to emace our humanity .
can you really imagine
( by today 's standard )
that walt whitman 's book were banned
because he acknowledged woman
as having feeling and emotional response as great as a man ?
think about that !
the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eye .
