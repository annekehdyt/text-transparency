basically 
i like verhoeven film
because in his film ,
i enjoy a illiant pscychosexual story
that i have seen
before in `` basic instinct '' .it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so
it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie.well ,
it is his previous direction
before his block buster hit `` basic instinct ''
and for that i was very much curious to watch
that movie and yeah ,
the movie has fulfilled my hope
and expectation.this movie `` the fourth man '' is a illiant pscychosexual drama
which is a lit bit complex for some audience .
the story of this movie is about a gay writer
named `` reve ''
( krabbe ) ,
an alcoholic person
who is life by his own moral value and see many vision
that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture ,
he introduce a seductive woman
named `` christine '' ,
who has a mysterious past
she does not want to reveal.reve do sex with her at her house
as she is a boy.next morning ,
he watch her sexy 
macho boyfriend 's picture on her table ,
the person
he met at the station.he is curious to meet him
and tell christine to invite him to her house.that is it .
i do not want to reveal the entire story
because it is a verhoeven movie
and the end of the film is really surprising ! especially 
i like the character `` reve ''
which is illiantly
played by `` krabbe '' .i
basically like his acting
because as a gay person i am purely
identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.i would like thank mr.verhoeven
to make such a black comedy.i rate this movie :
10/10 .
