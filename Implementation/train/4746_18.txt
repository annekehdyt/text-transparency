considering its pedigree ,
this should be a far more enjoyable film
than it is .
even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentric in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie
which ings together lemmon 
lanchester 
kovacs and gingold ?
- the entire event is dully paced 
drearily shot and 
more often than not 
witless.kim novak 's gift were not essentially comic ,
as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid .
jame stewart was a fine comedian ,
as he ably demonstrated in movie from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey .
i think
he comes out better from this mess
than anyone else does .
except maybe the cat .
