cameron diaz is a woman
who is married to a judge ,
played by harvey keitel ,
whose life is fine until an ex shows up
and thing get a little complicated..
while i was watching this movie
there were several time i
asked myself
why i was doing so..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted
without any believability .
nor does
the audience really car what happens..even the lovely cameron can not save this one on a scale of one to ten..2
