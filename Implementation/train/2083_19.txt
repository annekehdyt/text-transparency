i was lucky enough
to have seen this on a whim during a film festival
and was smacked so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three screening .
a funny 
savage and sharp-toothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed
without tasting by the lowest-common-denominator target audience waged by a lone-avenger journalist
who slowly takes in member for his guerilla-war on predictability
is what the movie 's all about ,
and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way
that you are left after the credit roll with hope renewed ,
and excited
that original film can still be made .
anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectation for something to light up their imagination
would do well to hunt
( and i do mean hunt )
this scarcely-seen item down .
for fan of fight club and any charlie kaufman film ,
and required viewing for anyone
who avoids multiplex like a rabid dog .
