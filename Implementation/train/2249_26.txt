this movie completely ran lap around the original dolemite .
it had everything
that makes a movie great..except for real actor .
( ernie hudson could not do it alone
and you know that !
lol )
i admit
that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan
to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible !
this movie has so many catchy line
it is pitiful !
i am embarrassed to say
that i know the theme song backward and forward !
i love jimmy lynch 's character to death ,
and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation ,
but the oscar were never ready for this !
this is a random film consisting of crooked cop 
breast 
chase 
bad editing 
and of course martial art .
( being that it is the 70 's and i can say
everyone knew some kind of martial art ) .
i think
this movie should be restored
and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theater !
