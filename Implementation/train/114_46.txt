i once used wesley snipe ' name as a clue
to go ahead
and watch a new 
untried film
in which he appears .
so now 
for the first time 
my snipe-method of film recommendation has failed .
utterly .
i should first have come here
to see these reviews.snipe ought to be ashamed
to allow his otherwise earnest effort
to be so wasted in `` the contractor '' .one of my worst flick fear has come to bitter fruition .
i feared
that the shaky 
blurry 
pseudo-documentary 
`` unconsidered ''
directing and editing style
( first ought to my attention by the paul greengrass-directed `` bloody sunday '' )
might propagate to other film .
greengass ' sickening style was then ought to nauseatingly new height in the last two of the bourne trilogy film .
my fear had come to pass .
in my opinion 
these film are made really bad by these motion-sickness-inducing method ,
which mistake blurry swipe for `` action-enhancement '' .
but the `` bourne franchise 
''
as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow ,
apparently convinced other in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast 
big bucks.read my lip ,
you hollywood type .
action needs to be clearly photographed and presented ,
not merely hinted at by poor 
lazy cinematographic techniques.and `` the contractor '' goes so far as to emulate `` the bourne ultimatum '' in inanely-repeated sound bite ,
in hope their juvenile
( apparently-evaluated )
audience can not sense them .
for example ,
if i hear a cop radio crackling `` yankee-romeo '' one more time ,
i will just scream .
the chance are good i will not hear it again :
i certainly will not ever view `` the contractor '' again.i recommend to those of you
who have yet to see `` the contractor '' :
just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.2/10 ;
i am tempted to lower that to a 1 .
