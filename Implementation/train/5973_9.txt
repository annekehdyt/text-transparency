the only aspect of this film
that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash
is a single line
uttered by an agent attempting
to infiltrate the man-eating tomato by dressing in a tomato costume :
`` can somebody please pass the ketchup ? ''
i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder
to use this film as a sedative ;
it works better than an overdose of demarol .
