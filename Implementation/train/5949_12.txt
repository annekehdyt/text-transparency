i had high hope for this film ,
since it has charlton heston and jack palance .
but those hope came crashing to earth in the first 20 minute or so .
palance was ridiculous .
not even heston 's acting or annabel schofield 's beauty
( or ief nude scene )
could save this film .
some of the space effect were quite good ,
but other were cheesy .
the plot was ludicrous .
even sci-fi fan should skip this one .
grade f
