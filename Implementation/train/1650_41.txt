man of honor has many great aspect to it .
good action sequence 
plenty of `` feel good '' scene 
a good musical score ,
but the part
that really makes the movie
is the great acting .
mostly by robert deniro .
the story of man of honor is focused about carl brashear
played by cuba gooding jr.
who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy .
it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer
to getting into diving school and even further .
it is a good story ,
but it seems like it has been done many time before .
a person 
against all of the odd 
will not give up
until they accomplish their goal
that they set for some sentimantal reason many year ago .
it could happen ,
but a lot of the struggle the brashear faces in the movie are questionable
including the c.o .
of the diving school tampering with his final test .
however 
all of that is made up for the scene
when robert deniro finally enters the movie .
deniro play mater chief sunday
who is the teacher at the diving school brashear
is attending .
as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance
that you can not hate
unless you have incredible wilpower .
before the movie ends 
deniro gives off multiple speech
that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way
he punches them out .
in the end you must doubt some of the aspect of the film ,
but admit it ,
if it was all the truth ,
it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minute .
