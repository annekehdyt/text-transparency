i actually did not mind the geico commercial the first 50 of so times i saw them
and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing 
but seriously !
this is the best thing
that these person could come up with ? ! ?
this show sucks !
it is bland
and feel like watching an episode of `` the office '' with the character disguised as caveman
( i know
a lot of you will hate me for saying
that but `` the office '' just does not do it for me ) .
okay 
i get it :
we have the poor slob
just trying to keep his nose clean
and he has a crappy boss
who hates him ;
the pseudo-intellectual
who really just has a barely-functioning intellect ;
and the dopey one
who just wants to be accepted ,
but so what ! ! !
i have worked with these person
and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tv ...
why would i want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominate ? ! ?
please call your parent and ask them
if they dropped you on your head
if after thinking about it ,
you still delude yourself into believing
that this is entertainment .
