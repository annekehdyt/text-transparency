the screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the `` exorcist ' .
but put in some blah-blah love story
that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged .
there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film .
it had the potential of being something special
but blows it
by showing a bunch of person yack about thing
nobody cares about .
extremely boring 
i wanted to leave the theater
when i saw this
but the dumb movie ticket were expensive
so i had to withstand the dreary torture
which felt like it lasted forever .
nothing on screen
connected relevance back
to whatever the character
were talking about.they use computer graphic in here
that instead of wowing me
( as it intended ,
i hate cgi )
just ruined the movie even more .
some person say
this movie did horrible in the movie theater
because of how `` thought-provoking '' and `` slow-paced-without-action-because it is an intelligent film ''
it was .
what is so intelligent or thought provoking
when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest
who has a love interest and disobeys his religion ?
seems like an uninspired concept .
oh and there is some mumbo jumbo about the `` sin-eater ''
( movie was originally going to be titled `` sin-eater '' ) .
lame concept
but the movie took the `` sin-eater '' thing too seriously ,
making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent
it was .
yeah 
i know
there were really sin-eater in the medieval time
but this movie just makes it sound cheesy.nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget
why i even bothered to see this movie .
if you want horror film
that actually have depth 
watch rosemary 's baby 
the tenant 
naked blood 
society 
cannibal holocaust 
pin 
exorcist 
oman 
or any of the romero `` dead trilogy '' film .
nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence person ,
mainstream movie fan think
that
though
( same kind of person
that think
a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece ) .
if you want mind-numbingly boring horror ,
watch the order .
this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride .
