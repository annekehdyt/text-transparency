with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr. `` epic '' of miscasting and misreading 
i can only wonder
that the jame dean `` legend '' could survive this outing ,
i submit
that then-studio obeisance to bankable box office `` giant ''
came a cropper of its own 'gigantismosis ' .
nor were rock and liz
that much better off .
let us just say
that the televised `` dalla '' was the authentic `` heir 
'' even if contemp
( tuous )
latterday `` texan '' like lay and delay 
not to mention our putative `` president '' of these here yewbenighted state of amurrika ,
perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimension .
i never read edna ferber 's original ,
but will lay odd
it is head and shoulder superior
to what got on screen herein .
and all those well-paid 
i would imagine ,
`` supporting '' actor of note and celeity notwithstanding 
`` giant '' is ,
to me at least 
a midget of scan not merit ,
never mind the promo campaign .
