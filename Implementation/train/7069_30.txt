warning !
spoiler ahead !
spoiler i have seen movie in german ,
so it might be ,
that i missed some clue .
despite some weakness in the plot ,
it is a movie
that came through to me .
i liked especially lexa doig 's acting .
sometimes i got impression ,
that she *is* camille .
but i can not stop wondering 
what happened at the end with bob 
cassie and baby .
i belive 
she ,
after initially being set on bob ,
eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his other and being forced to lie to him .
otherwise it is a bit strange ,
that she would carry his baby and love it .
it is up to viewer to decide -
and i do not like such ending .
dean cain was as good as ever 
eric robert .. well ,
i have seen him better but also worse .
i believe
that the film is more an analysis of human relation
and reacting in unexpected situation than a crime story .
bottom line is 
i liked it very much .
