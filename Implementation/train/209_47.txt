william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in `` the ex-mrs. bradford 
''
also starring jean arthur 
eric blore 
and jame gleason .
it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom
he was teamed .
though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple ,
the actor made a couple of other `` thin man '' type movie 
one with ginger roger and this one with arthur ,
both to very good effect.somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty 
debonair professional and `` the ex-mrs. bradford '' is no exception .
the ex-mrs. b has mr. b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery
that she is dragged him into .
and this is not the first time
she is done that !
it almost seems
as though there was a `` bradford '' film before this one
or that this was intended to be the first of a series of film - mr. b complains
that his mystery-writer ex is constantly inging him into case .
this time 
a jockey
riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously
falls off the horse and dy right
before the finish line.the solution of the case is kind of outlandish
but it is beside the point .
the point is the banter between the couple
and the interference of the ex-mrs. b. jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny .
however 
with an actress
who comes off as ainy as arthur does ,
the humor seems intentional rather than featherained .
i suspect
the writer had something else in mind - say 
the wacky side of carole lombard .
when arthur hears that the police have arrived ,
she says ,
`` ah 
it is probably about my alimony .
i have been waiting for the police
to take a hand in it 
''
it is more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement .
it still works well ,
and it shows
how a good actress can make a part her own.definitely worth watching ,
as william powell and jean arthur always were .
