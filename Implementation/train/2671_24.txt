going into a movie like i this ,
i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kill ... ..what i got was even less.christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parent
doing it
while daddy is in a santa suit .
horrified 
he runs up the stair and cut himself .
the story begins 33 year later
and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe ...
..cept for the fact he is obsessed with santa .
after his boss makes fun of him
he goes insane ,
dressing up like santa
and starts killing non-santa believing patron and his boss .
an unruly neighborhood catch up to him
and just as they are about to torch him ,
he drives his van off a cliff ... ..into the moon .
not the best ending i have seen
but it was original.it was a slow paced 
boring movie
that really had no redeeming quality
except when harry went apeshyt on the church goer .
there was hardly any gore
and even the `` sex '' scene were toned down.too boring ... ...
4/10
