another case of a decent dvd
case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film .
it was not that bad .
rochon does a serviceable job and damn !
the cast is good looking .
i have never seen
that many musclebound guy hang out together on a regular basis .
this movie really wanted to make you think
rochon was the killer ,
but it was not to be .
my biggest problem with the film was that by the end 
i did not much care
who was the killer ,
and the real killer made little sense ,
since it was out of the blue and the filmmaker were thinking 'ha ,
betcha did not see that one coming 
sucker ! ' .
yeah 
there were continuity error about
( mainly with ms. rochon 's ever-changing wardrobe ) ,
but for an indie slasher it is not that bad .
i was pretty sure at the beginning
it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girl to go topless ,
but that was just a gimmick .
the dialog was overly think
and painful at times.just do not have high expectation going into this ,
and it will not be that bad .
and lloyd kaufman 's cameo is wonderfully understated .
