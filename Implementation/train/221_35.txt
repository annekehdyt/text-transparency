genie
( zoe trilling )
arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical ,
bible-quoting archeologist father
( william finley )
and attracts the attention of a group of cultist
led by a descendant of the marquis de sade
( robert englund ) .
englund also plays de sade in flashback 
ranting in his cell .
genie is led astray by mohammed
( juliano merr ) ,
who rides around naked on a horse and sabina
( alona kamhi ) ,
a bisexual
who introduces her to opium smoking ,
which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancer 
a woman simulating oral sex on a snake 
an orgy and her father preaching in the background !
meanwhile 
black hooded cult member decapitate 
gouge out eyeball and slit throat .
when genie is slipped drug in her tea ,
she imagines de sade hanging from a cross 
a gold-painted woman in a leafy g-string
and herself bloody on a bed covered in snake .
it is all
because she is the reincarnation of de sade 's lost love.this
typically sleazy harry alan tower production is redundant 
seedy and pretty senseless ,
but the set 
costume 
cinematography and location work are all excellent
and at least there is always something going on.score :
3/10
