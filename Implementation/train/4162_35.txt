first of all 
this film was not released to theatre
( tested poorly they say ) ,
i say
they figured the story of crooked cop ,
politician and dedicated newspaper person had been done to death ,
just send it dvd and cable tv >
and take the money and run.that
being said
i usually like this type of movie 
especially with this named cast .
morgan freeman 
justin timberlake 
kevin spacey 
l.l.cool j 
cary elway 
john heard and on the distaff side 
piper perabo and roslyn sanchez.the plot and story have been done to death ,
but the above cast ings life to this violent movie
and it is actually watchable.justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by morgan freeman ,
the other are either crooked cop ,
and politician or somewhat decent guy 
the 2 lady are the girl friend of ll cool j and justin timberlake
and do what required ,
it is quite violent 
many killing etc 
not for child .
by no means is the a great film ,
but for what it is and the cast it is definitely good ,
