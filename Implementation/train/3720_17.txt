i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake .
he has got to be one of the best actor i
have seen .
and i was surprised
there were so many humorous line throughout the film .
he was extremely good at this too
although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before .
the film gets you
involved with the character
and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all .
i did not know what to expect from jewel 's performance but i think
she did rather well .
lot of exciting scene .
a thoroughly good ride .
i am absolutely a fan of maguire 's .
check out cider house rule .
one of the all time best ever .
