hurrah !
a space film
that does not take itself too seriously
and everyone can come along for the exciting ride
that is space camp .
the film starts slowly ,
the usual mix of idiot and high-flier mixed together into a dodgy soup .
but when the going gets tough -
the tough get themselves sorted out
and it is not an un-believable change in the character
as you can believe
that there is some responsibility in their young minds.the
only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the `` i am right
and you are all wrong '' instructor .
i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote .
