`` the last big thing '' is a wonderful satirical film
that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction .
the character are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with .
which ings me to an introduction to the character i liked best ...
simon geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s
who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine
called `` the next big thing '' .
thing is 
this magazine does not really exist ,
and it is only an excuse for simon
to get close to actor by interviewing them ,
only to bitch-slap them silly 
insulting their way
of buying into pop culture .
his live-in female friend 
darla 
is also writing a magazine
( which is real ) ,
which mainly has to do with her and simon 
as well as her and her father .
darla is a genuinely loveable
( or loathable )
character ,
depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior .
magda is a prostitute ,
the character i liked the best .
brent is a flat character with not much to him ,
as is tedra 
the music-video queen for a bunch of b-rated rock band .
still 
these character weave a very interesting web together .
and this movie question all the motivation
that person have for what they do
and why they do it .
its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it
if you are in the indie/art house crowd .
mark my word !
