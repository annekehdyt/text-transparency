unbelievably awful film .
i watched part of this on t.v .
recently .
my jaw dropped
as i watched a horrendously conceived plot
and listened to mind-numbing drivel .
not a single line from the master of one-liner could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle .
it was so bad
it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield 's body ,
slap him around and scream ,
`` how could you ? ''
i know
many film are done in haste ,
hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme .
but please 
hollywood 
show a little respect for your audience .
it is sad and scary
that person were expected to pay to see such tripe .
the bottom of the cesspool 
even by sunday afternoon television standard .
