i was fully amped up to see this film .
i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand .
i should not have built myself up so much
because it was so disappointing
and is without a doubt clark 's worst film there is so much wrong with this film .
first off 
some of the acting is great 
in particular nick stahl as 'the bully ' 
and the girl with the curly own hair
( i can not recall her name ) ,
but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable 
especially leo fitzpatrick .
he is a veteran of clark 's film now
and he was so illiant in 'kid ' ,
but in 'bully ' he invests his line with such solemnity
as to turn his scene into a parody virtually .
the screenplay felt
like it had been written by a first year film student .
no sorry 
a high school student ... one
who has never seen a movie before .
and i could not fathom clark 's intention .
was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kid ' existence ?
it sure
as hell did not stop him getting in a damn good perv .
i am no prude
but i did not need to see teenage east and buttock every 5 minute .
i still maintain
that clark 's best film is 'another day in paradise ' .
it is fantastic
and i do not think
he will ever top it .
