unlike `` the adventure of buckaroo banzai '' 
or `` big trouble in little china '' 
or `` conan the barbarian '' ,
which are horrible film
that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor
that turn them into cult sensation ,
the golden child is just plain bad.the premise itself is not unworkable ,
and there are some funny moment .
but here the eddy murphy `` flip attitude '' just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story .
and the special effect are silly enough to do more damage to that tension .
the `` mystic secret '' of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.without a feeling
that anything is at stake ,
or that the character are faced by real danger ,
why should we care ?
who should see this film :
-- big fan of eddy murphy
who can not help themselves --
i can not think of anyone elsei will give this film a 4/10 for the occasional joke
that worked .
