i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movie can still have 3 movie hit the shelve in less than a year.attack force
being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal.vision of bad movie entertainment flashed
before my gullible eyes.sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad
as they come.seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy-but enjoyable shadow man last time
we saw him.however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever !
do not argue for out for a kill 
ticker 
or even black dawn folks.this is the bottom of the septic tank here.anyone
who says
this is steven seagal 's return to form
should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste .
seagal is yet another agent/i am a supreme bad-ass
yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team
that leads him to a nefarious plot
to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public.not
to mention the dealer are not from around here.the whole production from directing to the acting is poor.was this movie shot in the dark ? its got ta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2.the action is terrible and very badly done.the producer have also unwisely decided to do what the fan hate the most : throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal.who seems to show little enthusiasm here.can ya blame him ?
while it has been said
that attack force was not the movie stevie
signed on for
( originally harvester )
and surely has to be better than attack force.the post-production tampering has not made it more coherent
and made seagal look worse.i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin
as they are gon na be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots.so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position
to come up with something to atone for this mess.but
after seeing
how bad attack force has turned out do
we really want him to make another movie ?
