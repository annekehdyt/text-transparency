one of the worst movie i have seen shoddy camera work 
crappy filter usage ,
film was grainy ,
script was terrible ,
i mean come on ,
how predictable was the big battle at the end ...
..some of the fight scene were okay i guess
... .some scene were so bad
it was comical ... like sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end ...
lol i mean really ..a horse ?
oh can not forget how the bad assassin roll around in the same vehicle throughout
the entire movie..one would think
that
after killling key witness and federal agent ,
they woulda been tracked down..etc ,
etc really do not bother watching it ...
