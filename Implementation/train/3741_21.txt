jeez 
only in the 70 's ... antonio margheriti ings us this quirky hyid of spaghettus western and kung fu flick
evolving around a treasure-hunt .
the spice of this trashy co-production between shaw brother and an italian one-off company include humorous storytelling 
off-the-wall happening and some very tame tanda .
extra campy moment are being served by lee van cleef 's obnoxious wig 
leather-clad bible-thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt
( loveably hammed up by julian ugarte 
the man
who should have done way more obscure european genre production
than he did ) ,
wanna-be-witty dialogue 
hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effect accompanying various little event
( especially every jump
made by lo lieh )
.while this little piece of action fall fare and square into the turkey territory ,
it is great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen ,
and you can not deny the charisma of this duo .
do not expect too much ,
and you will get plenty out of it.this is my truth .
what is yours ?
