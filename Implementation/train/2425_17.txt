this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships.eventually
they do become spoken ,
but is there a chance
to change anything about the situation.originally
made in shanghai 1948
and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family .
there is still some weight about the history
that surrounds the family .
history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film.a young married couple - liyan 
an invalid 
and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound
that is partially ruined.a ight contrast is liyan 's young sister
who can not really remember the past of the family
but accept everything in quite a natural way .
her spirit is as ight
as the other two are reserved.into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... i
ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film .
