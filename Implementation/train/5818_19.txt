not only is this a great african-american classic comedy ,
but one of many great american cult classics.i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore.if
you love the old school karate movie and black comedy ,
this is for you !
they do not make movie like these anymore .
my entire family are movie buff ,
so this site is an extreme help
on solving many debate .
i am deployed in iraq right now .
this helps me to stay connected to world
that i know in the state .
thank you imdb.i recommend this site to all my friend .
dolemite rule !
do not just take my word for it ,
check them out for yourself .
ten line is a lot for commenting on one movie i think ,
but
