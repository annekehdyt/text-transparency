i searched out this one
after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging `` clueless ''
( 1995 ) ,
perhaps alicia silverstone 's best known effort from early in her film career .
`` true crime '' has kevin dillon ,
which should be helpful in improving most film project .
in fact everyone in the cast does a good job .
the only disappointment i think
the movie has for me is an awkward `` feel '' to some of the scene ,
coming from the need
to run a quite uncompromising ,
grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out
as a schoolgirl adventure.alicia silverstone is pretty good in this one .
she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease
that affects mary giordano
as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murder .
i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too .
the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement .
it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer 's life .
just a thought !
`` true crime '' shows its director in a good light .
pat verducci also has the writing credit .
i do not know of any other film work pv has done .
i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.like most production ,
this one has a largely unknown supporting cast 
although bill nunn
( detective jerry guinn )
is hardly that .
over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearance .
i recall seeing him recently in `` carrier ''
( 1998 ) ,
a made for tv presentation with a military theme .
bill nunn played `` captain arend '' .
fan of the classic us tv comedy show
`` who 's the boss ''
may also have an interest in `` carrier ''
because the leading player is judith light ,
remembered with affection by many
because of her lengthy involvement with the show .
`` true crime '' could easily not have worked ,
but it does ok. i think
it is an entertaining story worth seeing .
