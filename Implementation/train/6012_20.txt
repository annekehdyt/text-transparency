... .cause it is crap !
the kind of movie
that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker
and say `` why ? `` .
horrible camera work ... count the time
the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can not .
the dialog is ridiculous .
the acting is comical .
it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west
to see
if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible .
i would bet $ 10
they used home video camera
to make this .
either that 
or most of the cameraman were drunk .
truly the trailer are more entertaining than the movie .
if you ever want to host a `` worst movie party '' ,
ing this one .
want more entertainment ... stare at a wall .
