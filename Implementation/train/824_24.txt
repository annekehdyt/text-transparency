`` the 40 year old virgin '' exists in a world i do not understand .
a world where an electronic store employee can tell his boss to `` f*** off '' and oadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded .
a world
where it is really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other people ' car .
a world
where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underling .
a world full of raging and offensive stereotype of ethnic minority .
and a world
without any funny joke !
i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewer
who liked this movie .
i thought
every scene was like a bad saturday night
live sketch -
not very funny to begin with ,
and stretched out beyond all rational thought .
the chest-waxing scene went on forever.the character 
aside from carell ,
were totally one-note .
and the romantic element were completely contrived 
particularly the scene
where keener finds porn in carell 's apartment .
that was just lame.and i also found the `` aquarius '' sequence totally annoying and excessive .
i hated hated hated this movie !
