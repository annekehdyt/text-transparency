chang cheh 's `` shaolin temple '' might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brother martial art film cycle .
this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable
who 's who of the shaw stable .
though the plot is fairly standard
and the fight choreography is superb as usual ,
it is cheh 's handling of the subject matter
that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable .
the sense of reverence displayed for the history
and tradition of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame .
not unlike william keighley 's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self
titled film or john ford 's salute to west point in `` the long gray line 
''
cheh 's `` shaolin temple '' is a lovingly crafted ode
in that same style.the cultural correlation i am tempted to make ,
is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo .
watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feeling
that you experienced many year ago in grade school history
when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed hero of the alamo .
at the end of the film 
you too might be tempted to call out ,
remember the shaolin temple !
