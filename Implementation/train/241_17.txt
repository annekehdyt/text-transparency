the western society has been fed idea about indium being a poor country .
movie like these only make those belief stronger .
such illustration make it all the more difficult for indiumn to be accepted aoad .
agreed there are poor and homeless in indium ,
but why is there no representation of educated person
if not the successful ones.i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa .
in my opinion this movie has shown indium in a very bad light
giving wrong notion .
it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society .
exactly the reason
why person ask me ,
`` when we go to indium ,
can we hire an elephant right outside the airport
so we do not have to walk on the road so full of filth and snake ?
`` those
who want a second opinion on contemporary indiumn society
should watch `` monsoon wedding '' .
