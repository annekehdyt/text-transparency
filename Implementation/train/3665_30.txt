samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker ,
mainly because he had some very inconsistent politic in his film .
while `` shock corridor ''
and `` the naked kiss '' represented the hypocrisy and lunacy of america
and `` the big red one '' was an effective portrait of the horror of war 
`` merrill 's marauder '' painted war
as necessary hell and `` pickup on south street '' is about the danger of communist spy .
all of his film make for very entertaining viewing ,
and
even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker ,
fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractor .
`` pickup on south street '' is no exception ,
and despite the dated theme ,
the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time .
its also a very quickly-pace 
tight 
and occasionally utal film noir.the acting across the board is fantastic .
richard widmark makes for a great anti-hero and jean peter is quite sexy as a girl
who works for her communist spy boyfriend .
the show stealer is thlema ritter however 
in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie .
the angle fuller employ are great ,
making the acting sequence all the more exciting and utal
( this is very violent for its time ) .
the camera continuously moves around
just as tarantino and his school would do forty year later .
`` pickup on south street '' is a great action-paced noir thriller .
`` shock corridor '' remains my favorite fuller film ,
but this is a very close second .
( 8/10 )
