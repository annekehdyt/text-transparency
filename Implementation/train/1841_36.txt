i have not read a biography of lincoln ,
so maybe this was an accurate portrayal ... ...
and maybe it is because i am used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayal
that unnaturally deify lincoln as illiant 
honorable 
and the savior of our country ... ...
but why would
they make a movie representing lincoln as a buffoon ?
while henry fonda made an excellent lincoln ,
his portrayal of him as an `` aw shuck ,
i am just a simple guy ''
seemed a little insulting .
[ granted ,
that was bushie jr. 's whole campaign ,
to make us think
he was `` just a regular guy ''
so we would not care
that he is a rich and privileged moron
-- but that is a whole other story .
] not only did the film show lincoln as sort of a simple
( almost simple-minded )
kind of guy 
the film state
that lincoln just sort of got into law by accident ,
and that he was not even that interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law
being about right and wrong .
in the film he is not a very good defense attorney
( he lounges around with his foot on the table
and makes fun of the witness ) ,
and the outcome is mostly determined by chance/luck.furthermore ,
partly because this was financed by republican
( in reaction to some play sponsored by democrat
that had come out )
and partly because it was just the sentiment of the time ,
the film is unfortunately religious ,
racist and conservative.do not waste your time on this film !
