quite unimpressive .
the 'twist ' are all pretty predictable ,
if you have seen any movie within the last ten year 
and the few somewhat interesting part
( wherein someone utilizes context clue
to make a decision )
are few and lack much punch ,
since the 'secret ' has already been shown
before these clue are explained .
( spoiler 
sorta )
the acting is decent enough .
the story simply is not very interesting .
the whole 'still awake ' premise become nullified by the astral projection stuff
( not kidding ) .
the surgery scene is initially tense 
a bit discomforting ,
but then become utterly banal.not horrible 
but not memorable .
terrence howard 's least interesting role to date ,
so far as i have seen .
kind of boring 
overall .
