this is the first movie i have seen of john singleton
and he is a pretty good director .
the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman
and it shows what happens to several of them .
omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship
and having a hard time
keeping up with his work .
he is friend with ice cube
and being dating tyra bank .
kristy swanson is a rich girl
who is date raped and becomes friend with jennifer connelly ,
who is a lesbian ,
and is not sure about which way to go .
michael rapaport is a kid from idaho
who falls in with a group of neo-nazis
and their leader is cole hauser .
those are the three main character
and laurence fishburne is a political science professor
who tries to help them .
it is a great film
and it is unfortunate
that the studio had to make several cut to the movie .
