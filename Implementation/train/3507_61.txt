following the success of `` paris 
je t'aime '' 
a group of director
decided to get together
and make a similar anthology style film
based in new york .
unlike the original film 
the story in this film seem to sometimes come
and go too quickly
-- by the time
you think
are getting into a story ,
it is over in too many case .
and 
the often start up and stop
and then begin again
-- with the story woven together .
as a result 
there is no title to indicate
that a story is complete
and it is less formal in structure.sadly 
however ,
while `` paris 
je t'aime '' was hit or miss
( mostly hit ) ,
most of `` new york 
i love you '' was miss .
the story tended to be much more sexual in nature
but also far less sweet
-- and often quite terrible .
it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional story
-- and perhaps the often depressing music made
it seem more so .
now understand 
it was good quality music
but its somber tone really 
really made me feel like cutting my wrist !
among the better one was the story about the young man
who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom ,
the couple
talking about cheating outside a restaurant
( though this was also in the first film )
and the crotchety old couple .
this is all so sad
because i had loved the first film so much
-- and i really wanted to love this film .
i respected what they tried
but simply did not like it very much.by the way ,
and this is not really a complaint ,
but i was amazed how many person were smoking in the film .
for a recent film ,
that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.also ,
if you get the dvd ,
there are two segment included as extra
that were not included in the film .
one consists of kevin bacon
( wearing a cool fedora )
eating a hotdog ... .and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minute .
the other features a teen
who spends the film videotaping the world
-- including a very unhappy couple .
