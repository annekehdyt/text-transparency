i thought
this movie was hysterical .
i have watched it many time
and recommend it highly .
mel brook 
was excellent .
the cast was fantastic..i do not understand
how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating .
i loved it.. i have seen other movie of his
and they were also funny
but this one really stick out in my mind
because of the humor.. his i just can not say enough about this movie .
i look for it to be on periodically
but it never on enough for me .
the person
playing the homeless person
were by comparison up to the funniest standard also .
please put this movie on more often .
i can not see it enough..leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine 
ever since cinderella .
i always thought
that she was not really funny
but loved her acting .
in this movie
she was very funny..and her and mel
did a great job together .
they should put more of his movie on tv .
