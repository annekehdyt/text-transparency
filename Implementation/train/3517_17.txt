rajkumar santoshi
without any doubt has directed the greatest movie and biggest box office hit of indian cinema.this movie falls short of all expectation as this movie stars two great actor mr. amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar
and when you have these two actor in the same movie
you have to make a magnum opus.in the later part of the movie
you can make out
that amitabh bachchan 's voice has been dubbed by some other person
which was due to his illness.still the movie did'nt had proper character development plus cinematography was'nt good too and one thing
that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effect
only when it is needed
and when applied should be done with a high budget.the script
had so many flaw
which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls
rather than watching the movie.the new comer shakes the leg well
but could not act well
but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography.a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh.but every director
once in a while in his career makes a bad film.so watch it
only if you are a fan of multi-starrer flop movie .
