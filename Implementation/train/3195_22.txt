another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peak 
also aptly .
yet another review expounded on the difference between the comedy
we enjoy non-critically and black comedy ,
also well worth consideration.watch the whole thing 
all three series .
at the end 
all the character are tied up
and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel .
the detail and intricacy are staggering .
thoroughly post-modern .
wickedly funny 
and startlingly tragic .
not for kid .
not for those with thin skin
or who lack objectivity .
thought-provoking .
at once literal 
figurative 
and surreal in disturbing way .
the blackest comedy i can recall.and very possibly the most wonderful thing
i will ever see .
