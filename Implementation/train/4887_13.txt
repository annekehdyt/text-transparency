it is about time we see a movie
that stays unbiased toward these old indian tradition .
at time it is clear how most of the 'doctor ' are charlatan ,
even lying about how they do not charge their client .
while they are wearing their gold watch ,
the 'donation ' box is mandatory .
notice that there are only a couple of person
who get 'cured '
while we see quite a few cases.keep in mind
while watching
that ingesting mercury is not toxic
and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee ,
while the average salary in india is 1,700 ru/month .
