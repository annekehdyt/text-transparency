`` sir '' john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one .
; this is one of those film 
i suppose ,
that is considered `` art 
''
but do not be fooled ...
..it is garbage .
stick to the `` art '' you can admire in a frame
because the film
that are labeled as such
are usually unintelligible forgery like this.in this masterpiece 
giegud recite shakespeare 's `` the tempest ''
while the camera pans away to nude person .
one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool .
wow 
this is heady stuff and real `` art 
''
are not it ? ?
that is just one example .
most of the story makes no sense 
is impossible to follow and 
hence 
is one
that liberal critic are afraid to say
they did not `` understand ''
so they give it high mark
to save their phony ego .
you want shakespeare ?
read his book .
