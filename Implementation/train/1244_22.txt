i am not a very good writer ,
so i will keep this short .
world at war is the best wwii documentary
that i have seen .
i have seen different wwii documentary
( not only english/north american )
and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary
that i have seen .
i think
it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why/how hitler got to power ,
but it does a very good job
at covering the war .
it seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone .
it does not exaggerate or diminish role of different nation .
it has a lot of original footage ,
including color footage and many eye witness
( it was made in 70 's when a lot more were alive ) .
it has great music and narrator .
all-in-all i gave this one 10/10 ,
because it is that good .
( i have not seen special in dvd version
so i can not comment on those )
