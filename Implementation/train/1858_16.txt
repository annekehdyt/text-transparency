going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical
because fantasy movie are not always my cup of tea .
especially a romantic fantasy.little did i know
that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic .
everything in the movie from plot
to dialogue to effect was very near perfection.claire dane shine like the star
she is in this movie .
from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character.michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.robert de niro is a lovable character
who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief
as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.overall this was a movie
that surprised
and delighted me as a movie fan .
if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie
that will be fun for the kid and adult alike ,
stardust is the way
to go .
