not sure one can call this an anti-war film ,
it shows war at an elite level .
these are elite troop
that know
what they are doing and take great pride in it .
even when they are pacifist ,
they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their fo ,
even if it does go against being a pacifist .
the movie is slow
and rather uneventful and in many way is rather tame as war movie go-more so by today standard ,
no body part flying off as in modern movie .
it is utal in other way
though
as you see killing at a personal level .
this is more of a thinking man 's movie .
once you
start to watch you do
not want to miss anything .
the thought of the man in the movie and their interaction 
is what
the movie is about- not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline .
this maybe called a war triller.if
you are into the skill of war ,
if you are into reading
or seeing program about the sas and so on ,
you want to watch this movie ! ! ! !
! comparable movie are the hill
( 1965 )
with sean connery 
49th parallel
( 1941 )
with an all star cast 
the naked and the dead
( 1958 )
with cliff robertson .
all are unusual in their way
and show war at a personal level .
