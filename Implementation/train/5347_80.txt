john carpenter 's career is over
if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication .
his excuse is that he only produced it .
jon bon jovi looks like a girl .
in fact 
bon jovi and the two vampire girl 
natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothe .
in short 
it was hard to tell
which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way .
bon jovi has the most charisma .
at least he looks happy
when he is smiling .
the two vampire girl on the other hand are all cramp and complaint .
at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss 
but stop .
amazing how each vampire movie has some set of moray for the respective vampire .
at one point 
arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter
and then she sucks his blood
while doing the sex act .
it would have been an erotic moment
except
that it was filmed like a total goof ,
and the male actor looked mildly amused
as he watched arly jover move her head
to mimic something
that was very obviously not happening .
as far as gore is concerned ,
a few head are ripped off 
and the blood spurt profusely .
these scene have so little suspense or build-up
that
when they happen
it is almost funny ,
and there is no `` horror '' pay-off from the scene .
all you get
as a member of the audience is a feeling of `` wow ,
that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the wall .
i wonder
who has to clean it up . ''
throughout the movie 
these vampire hunter
who are obviously trying to kill arly jover
( the top vampire in the world ? ? )
keep reaching out to her .
at one point 
bon jovi goes into the abandoned church
and
after he just shot her with an arrow
( and has done so on other occasion ) ,
he says
`` i am not trying to hurt you .
i just want to talk to you .
i want to get to know you . ''
huh ? ?
of course 
the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say
hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device .
`` why can not we be friend ''
the 1970s hit
song by war should have been the theme song for this movie .
aside from all of the other silly moment 
there is a transfusion sequence
when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed ,
and the town person all line up to donate blood for her transfusion .
i guess blood type is not important ?
anyhow 
all her vampire blood is removed .
bon jovi then decides
that
if that blood is transfused into him ,
he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also .
of course ,
as the vampire blood is transfused into him ,
none of his healthy blood is removed .
so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood
as any human can have in his body .
and just like the first vampire 
this one also has the vampire-bursting-into-flames special effect .
