ya know
when one looks at this brian depalma film today ,
i am sure
there has been allot of criticism
about how dated it is .
also 
about the violence .
when i looked at this film on vhs
when i was 20 ,
i thought
it was ulta-violent and gritty as well .
but i did not get 'it'.a few decade go by and man ,
how i know
how much i did not get in this film ! !
this is a remake of an excellent film
which was done back in the 30's/40 's .
how can you improve upon a classic ?
ya do not .
but you tell a tale
that is ought up to date through the eye of the `` new immigrant '' during the most greed ridden decade 
the over indulgent 80 's .
depalma 
stone and the gang present an ambitious 
disturbing and darn right good film.ye ... .disco was dying
and new wave/punk were taking over but these immigrant from cuba
who had to make a new home in florida
could not tell the difference .
it was exciting ,
it was what they wanted but how to get it ? ? ? ?
to these immigrant 
there was only one way
to get it in florida
where they were..by having lot of money
and to get the money ,
you had to take over running a drug empire.al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana 
the `` little train
that could '' .
what an amazing way
to have your lead character look at america :
to fight 
kill 
steal .
lie 
cheat all to get
-- `` the money 
the woman and the power .
`` that is what tony saw
as the american dream.he wanted it ,
he wanted to live it
and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it .
tony montana 's command of the english language was heavily saturated with the `` f '' word
but what did you expect ,
emily post 's finishing school for him and his co-hort ?
look at how they came to america ,
what they knew ,
what they were exposed to .
this is the way
tony and his crew chose to `` be all
they can be in america . ''
it was all about the power .
tony montana would and did anything to achieve it..it all its violent 
lying 
stealing 
crooked 
thieving glory.the part of the film
that personified the 1980 's to me ,
is the money laundering .
tony 's crew inging sack of drug money to the bank .
did those around tony and his crew care ?
at the club where he spent and drank ?
nope .
money was money and with money ,
you get the power .
tony was living high off the hog .
he and his pretty blond american trophy
he married played well by michelle pfieffer.after tony montana 's rise to power ,
he finds out its really crappy up there .
he is riddled with doubt ,
he is drug addicted ,
he is paranoid ,
he is surrounded by those
who want to take him on in a bloody take-over ,
his trophy 80 's american blonde drug addicted wife
he finds out is a bore ,
he needs to keep atop of his empire
because ... he is going down .
and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion ,
but again i ask ,
what do you expect ?
this is the quintessential 1980 's film
telling you a warped tale
of how some misunderstand the american dream ... to obsession .
it is violent 
bloody 
overly so..but
it drives the point disturbingly home .
not all cuban thrown out of cuba
who landed in florida in the 80 's
were anything like tony montana .
give me a eak .
but the showing of how miserable the 1980 's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measure in the usa to `` be somebody ''
and have power took its tool on these poor character and their life in america.make you wonder
-- has anything from then --
been learned today ?
