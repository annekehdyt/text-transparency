the john goodman program was pretty awful ,
but this thing just plain stink .
the one and only thing in this mess
that made me smile
was recognizing the voice of patrick starfish as frosty .
the story is hopeless ,
written by somebody
who has garbled memory of childhood rebelliousness
but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening year .
paranoia rule the dark world
that these character inhabit .
everybody is unpleasant 
and for no reason .
the plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable 
unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way
there is no fun
in watching it .
the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow !
