there is something kind of sad
about seeing someone
who is so good
at doing something try to do something very different ...
and end up being mediocre .
i was thinking about jordan playing baseball ,
but the same apply to steve martin.this movie is reasonably well acted and directed ,
but the script is a stinker .
martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in `` roxanne '' ,
but this effort
to ing a victorian drama to the contemporary scene smack
straight into a wall of implausibility .
if you want to see an old story updated with some style ,
best to rent `` great expectation '' .
