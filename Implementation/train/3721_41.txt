gorgeous techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a trappist monk
who has left his monastery 
eaking his vow .
the film opens at a convent in europe ,
where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named domini
( marlene dietrich ) .
she is advised by the mother superior
to go to the desert and `` find herself '' ,
and lose her grief over her father
who has recently died .
in the train car on the way into the sahara
she sits opposite a very 
very troubled man
( charle boyer )
- our former monk .
she is soon at a hotel near a palm-treed oasis
where she again sees our mysterious troubled man
as he is stumped over what to do
when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl .
domini becomes friend with him ,
though knows nothing of his past - romance soon to follow.this film is sentimental 
melodramatic 
and different
( in a way 
almost surreal and even a bit campy )
-
i found it to be quite fun and entertaining .
the photography in this is really interesting -
it is full of extreme facial close-up and beautiful color shot of caravan of horse crossing the desert ,
silhouetted figure against a sunset sky .
marlene dietrich gives a nicely done ,
though restrained 
performance here and looks gorgeous .
charle boyer - not usually one of my favorite - is actually pretty good in this ,
i think
the part sort of suit him
and he looks quite young and handsome too .
basil rathbone is fine here ,
except given very little to do .
another great orchestral score by max steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all 
a very enjoyable film .
