i admit ,
the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blue ,
i did not think
it was very memorable in any regard .
but now after viewing it the 7th time ,
i admit
that it has very much grown on me .
the character of sissy 
ms. jellybean 
and the countess have become very endearing .
and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet .
though the plot is very weak ,
i think
the satirical humor more than makes up for it .
then there is the kick-ass soundtrack
which features the tremendously talented k.d .
lang
( who reminds me a little of patsy cline )
at her best .
i can not think of any movie
that has `` grown on me '' after an inauspicious first impression ,
as much as cowgirls has .
