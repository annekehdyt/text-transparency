everyone in the cast 
from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone
we know in everyday life .
they were so natural ,
and sugiyama 's transformation is incredibly believable .
the score is so moving ,
it ought me to tear .
the choreography was beautiful
without seeming athletic .
mai 's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebump .
tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character .
you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face
as she reminisces about seeing `` the king and i '' .
aoki 's character is both hilarious and pitiful .
masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife ,
you almost want to hug her to reassure her
that everything will be all right.this film
is truly a keeper .
