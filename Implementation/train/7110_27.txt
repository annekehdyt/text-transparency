i will start by saying
that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone !
the fact is it was not what anyone was expecting 
especially from guy ritchie .
what everyone was expecting was cockney geezer and good one liner `` do ya like dag ? ''
etc ,
but this is far more mature than his previous work .
i would agree
that it is confusing
but all the fact are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder ,
this film demands all your attention !
look past the cool and dazzling look of the film ,
try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performance and i think
we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film.yes this has its influence from modern classic
( fight club ,
pulp fiction etc )
but it is in the whole original in both direction
and pacing with a music score second to none .
i feel
that
if everyone watched this film over
and over they would understand
it a lot more and maybe appreciate
it for the fine piece of modern cinema
that it is and i hope
also
that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney `` masterpiece '' .
