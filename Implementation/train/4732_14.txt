i am glad the folk at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into .
i had a suspicion
it was trying to be a comedy ,
but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i was not sure .
for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous `` twist '' ending ,
which confirms
what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is .
it is hard to describe just
how amateurish the hazing really is .
did anyone
involved in this film
have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing ?
actually worth watching so
that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is .
