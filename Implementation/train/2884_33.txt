this is a great movie
that everyone should see .
it plays like a dean koontz book.bill paxton 's performance was great
in that it really seems like he believes
in what he is saying
and doing.i do not know
why viewer have to read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in to the film .
it is fiction .
the ending is surprising 
but fictional .
so what ?
i think
that is what makes this movie so good .
spoiler do not read further
if you have not seen the movie .
throughout the movie 
the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton 's character 
the impact on the child 
and the way
the child handle this outrageous conduct .
and then at the end 
it turns out to be true .
god has put him on a mission
to rid the world of demon .
paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewer suggest .
sure 
he is given info
that he could not have known otherwise ,
but the movie goes further
to show
how god is `` protecting '' adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent .
the film is not advocating christian murder ,
it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride .
