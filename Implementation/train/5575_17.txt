gee 
what a crappy movie this was !
i can not understand what person find so scary about `` the grudge '' .
the director plays one trick
( i would have to admit a very good one ,
that is ought to life very stylized )
and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again .
as a consequence i startled a few time in the first quarter of the movie ,
but once i knew
the drill i practically fell asleep
as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute .
to conclude 
i can say
that there are a lot better movie in the genre
to begin with ,
that the so-called predecessor `` the ring '' was way scarier
and that buying a ticket for `` the grudge '' is a waste of money .
