this is a strange sex comedy
because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex ,
most of which takes place in the back of a car
and is so graphic
it makes
basic instinct look like an edition of teletubby .
i kid you not ,
the sex in this film is so in your face
it might just choke you ,
especially if you`re watching with your grandparent .as for the rest of rita 
sue and bob too there`s not much else worth
mentioning except the language
where every single sentence seems to contain the f word .
this a rather bleak hyper-realist british film made at a time
when channel 4 was the main investor in british movie
which explains its made for television low budget feel
