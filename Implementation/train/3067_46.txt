i just came back from the late-night cinema
and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real-life black and white image of the partition 
the freedom movement 
etc
which was very much reminiscent of the life ' our forefather faced !
amidst this backdrop 
mind you 
there was no tel/fax/internet in those time but for the very voice of truth and non-violence 
the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict raj.gandhi shown as a hardworking attorney in south africa ,
who stood for his basic ideology
and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with humility and sainthood
which to the uttered speech of general smut was shown as a nice farewell on screen.it had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour and a veiled threat to the british raj in india ! there was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the british in india now that gandhi 
the politician is set for india
( towards sainthood ) .the very backdrop of a big family with many kid needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it is spell on the unfortunate kid 's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions.little did harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasure in life and fail in front of the huge idol of his father.he try to do away from mentor-ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbour in the street of gandhi 's residence when harilal vent out his frustration in open.this means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversion and alcoholism 
with debt and dis-obedience fuelling his negative thought.he still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scene and even gandhi 's humble expression form harilal to forgive him did not meet any conclusion in his mind
as he always feared the father ,
gandhi.he could not digest the fact that gandhi could not share his love with him
as he expected and was driven to rebellion when he could not understand the equal-merit based delivery of scholarship money by his father to his cousin
where he saw a failed opportunity
to study for barrister in england.this
had to take it is toll in him thrown to the street as a beggar
when the whole of india was celeating the indepedence !
the life of a destitute never changes come what may but the manner
in which the sad death of kasturba and gandhi himself is shown ings in an emotional silence.finally the last turbulent
thought of the dying harilal is shown as a flashback
to keep the audience gripping
and wondering
where did the father of the nation go wrong ?
was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an-one man army and use his ave soldier-son as a weapon
to show to the british and rival force
that
when it comes to the interest of the nation ,
nothing comes in between.sadly
though that to read a mahatma 's heart one has to live outside his family
and see
which the emotionally naive harilal could not see
living inside ... .a pity
that such naive harilal 's are still ruining the effort of many mahatma-like father in many family in today ' life
and have taken to drug 
alcoholism and god knows
what thought !
! here is a message to all those ave sainik
( soldier )
-son please respect the father of the nation ! please obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else
it is a disaster in waiting ,
is not it ?
