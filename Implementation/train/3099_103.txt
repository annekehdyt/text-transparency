this film center on four criminal 
locked away in a prison
who desire escape from their cell ,
hoping that a mysterious book of black magic ,
penned by a former inmate around 1920 ,
named danver
who wanted to use spell
to keep his skin young.carr\u00e8re 's
( g\u00e9rald laroche )
criminal business tactic
( shortcut ) have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates..a transsexual ute marcus ( clovis cornillac ) 
marcus ' love-toy p\u00e2querette
( dimitri rataud )
who eats objects
he touches
( ..and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister )
and obeys his charge
as if `` he '' were his mother ,
and the scholarly lassalle
( philippe laudenbach )
who does not read ,
or eat eakfast
( ..the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day ) .
the film follows carr\u00e8re
as he reads from the book ,
attempting to understand
it is meaning hoping to find an exit from his prison .
carr\u00e8re loves his child ,
and for a while believes
his wife will get him out early on bail .
when she betrays him ,
carr\u00e8re begin to slowly seethe with hate 
and longing to see and hold his beloved son .
carr\u00e8re 's toughest critic is marcus ,
who longs to be fully female ,
while still folding to several masculine trait ,
such as working out
and taking a leak standing up .
he talks tough
and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic ,
although deep inside is a world of vulnerability .
p\u00e2querette is completely under marcus ' control and behave like a canine
to it is master..there
is even an alarming scene
where p\u00e2querette east-feed from marcus !
lassalle is an unraveling mystery ,
opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motive
and what lies within his possibly sinister ain .
clearly intellectual ,
and holding possible secret from the other ,
lassalle is actually the one
who keeps the motivation
of pursuing the secret of the book going .
soon 
those
who are not a threat
to the book seek their `` true '' escape 
not as much from the cell of four wall ,
but the cell
that imprisons their true desire .
after a certain murder 
the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character
entering the film with a camcorder
as if he were a new occupant..who is this person
and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away ,
and better yet 
how to use it ?
a constant in this film is each of the prisoner often seen throughout
looking out their window into the world
just out of reach.i
am glad i had a chance
to watch this film .
it does play out like `` monkey 's paw '' ,
the character get what they desire ,
but a price must be met .
there is gore in the film ,
startling moment of graphic violence ,
but 
in my opinion 
this is first and foremost a story-driven tale .
the gore is a product
of what the book unleash .
one of the group gets his limbs twisted
while suspended in the air ,
while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man 's desire .
we see danver 's fate at the end 
with a magnificent special effect sequence
regarding an infant melting away .
lassalle 's fate is a masterful effect sequence .
i will say
that mal\u00e9fique 
through eric valette 's well paced direction 
always kept my attention ,
and 
for being such an isolated movie
( ..about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location 
the prison cell )
it never seems to drag .
i guess
that is a testament to interesting actor and fascinating characterization ,
not to mention a compelling story
using the supernatural
to drive them .
