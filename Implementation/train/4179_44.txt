being that i loved the original `` caligula '' even with all its flaw ,
i have to say
this remake trailer was abysmal.listening to jovovich say in that lazy american accent `` mmm cuhligyooluh ... '' makes me feel sick .
the set does not look roman at all ...
it look like some rich actor 's hollywood mansion backyard ,
and the roman costumes look like cheap crap
you buy at a suburban costume shop.that `` charming '' adriana asti look like a fifty year old hispanic woman
totally terrified out of her mind ,
as if not knowing
it is a movie trailer.the acting has got to be some of the worst i
have ever seen ,
with most of the line i hear being random actor
screaming `` caligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ''
as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly
as they can.the random sex scene also filled a good 40 or 50 % of the trailer 
and the scene with notable actor/actresses like gerard butler
( who graces the screen in shadow for all of three and a half second )
not doing anything
but looking uncomfortable or going all-out over the top with their minimal line ,
just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery.courtney love 's part consist of her
looking like her usual dumpy crack-whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something .
you can not tell
because she is either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically.karen black is just annoying ... randomly laughing ,
and screaming in such a way
that irritates you.helen mirren ...
she was in the original ,
and her return to `` caligula '' consist of ...
`` caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ''
i particularly `` love ''
( and by love 
i mean hate )
ennia 's line 
`` caligola ... j00 no maki me *something incoherent* ... . *something
that sounds like j00nalo* ''
it is also insanely arrogant to say
caligula 's four year reign was greater than jesus 's birth and death.honestly ,
this has got to be the worst 
most exploitative 
self-indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as `` art '' i have ever seen .
even if gore vidal hated the original caligula 
he should not have shown up or given his name over for this crap-pile ,
no matter how much they paid him
( unless it was a billion trillion yen ) .
worst trailer ever .
