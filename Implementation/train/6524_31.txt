this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard .
we had several friend over one night and for some reason
or another had channel-surfed to hbo during the course of the evening .
someone by the name of `` eddie izzard ''
was on.i tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few joke .
i did not want to be held `` responsible '' for the rest of the group 's enjoyment of something
that was obviously killing me .
after holding in my laugh for more than was healthful ,
i let go
-- as did the other of us
( we were not stoned 
by the way ,
nor talking of insurance and pension ... ) .
we were asphyxiated after that .
the story line 
the plot 
the bizarre yet ingenious connection throughout
the sketch are nothing short of illiance .
i have since been addicted to every eddie-izzard-piece-of-comedy i can get my hand on .
his work is sheer genius .
his comedy appears effortless .
he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this
or that ... it is convulsively funny .
he gives you the impression
that the joke is between you .. and himself 
the only true aficionados of humor 
after all .
if you are disappointed in this video ,
you have no sense of the penultimate in humor
-- or humour ,
as they say in the uk .
