i guess its possible
that i have seen worse movie ,
but this one is a real stinker !
the plot is unremarkable
but thats not the worst of it .
the directing is no
where close to what you would expect from andy ching .
he is capable of good work
but failed to pull this movie together.angie harmon ,
playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into
who 's behind the assassination of the president ,
truly butchered the role .
there was no chemistry with gooding ,
her demeanor was flat and wooden ,
and the 5 inch spike heel
she wore throughout
the movie were absurd .
this outing for harmon place her solidly at the bottom of the `` b '' list.and what was cuba gooding thinking ? ? ?
he has to his credit a number of outstanding performance ,
but this was far beneath what we have come to expect from him.poor jame wood and burt reynold .
poor poor poor poor poor .
