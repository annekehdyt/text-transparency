i enjoyed this movie quite a lot .
i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie
only emphasizes it .
she portrays a housewife in an african-american family
which is moving up the social chain due to the husband 's
( danny glover )
success as an attorney .
she moves to an all white neighborhood
where the person are friendly ,
yet a little awkward toward her .
the various event
that arise during the course of the movie make for some laugh
but mostly appeal to the other emotion .
this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama .
i give it a strong 8/10 .
i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon .
