i remember
seeing this movie shown several year ago on the lifetime tv network
and thought
it was an interesting story .
several year later i see it again
and fall head over heel in love with this movie .
the story behind
the movie is fascinating in and of itself .
the cast just makes it that much more appealing .
meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture .
she nails mrs. chamberlain 's mannerism 
the accent 
and even look .
she shows the pain 
hurt 
surprise 
and anger
that lindy had to endure ,
and in the process it is hard to remember
that it is not lindy .
in my opinion 
this performance of meryl 's was better than her oscar-winning turn in `` sophie 's choice '' ,
and should have garnered her her third oscar .
sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain ,
and for some surprising reason 
was not recognized by the academy with at least a nomination .
in all 
this movie only receive one oscar nod
( streep 's for best actress . )
however 
it did receive several australian oscar and nominations.definitely a top-rate movie :
it tells a great story
and you get great performance from the entire cast .
