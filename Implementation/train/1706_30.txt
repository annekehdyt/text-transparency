i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival ,
with the great dr. uwe boll in attendance.the film is 
simply put 
very 
very bad .
and no 
not in the usual uwe boll `` so bad it is actually entertaining '' way ,
but just plain bad .
the plot concerns a man
who leads a terrible life
( because of a past criminal record 
apparently ) ,
can not get a job ,
and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife .
this man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan
to steal a truck load of toy
that contain the bird flu virus .
al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toy ,
and what follows is just under two hour of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.the acting is awful
( except for dave foley ,
who really tries ,
despite it all ) ,
the joke never rise above child
being shot in the chest in slow motion ,
and person taking a poo .
it is supposed to be satire ,
but i am not sure of what.think `` airplane !
`` 
but done by the creator of south park ,
and without any joke .
