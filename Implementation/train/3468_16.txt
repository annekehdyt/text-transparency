when i refer to malice as a film noir i am not likening it to such masterpiece as sunset boulevard 
double indemnity or the maltese falcon ,
nor am i comparing director becker to alfred hitchcock 
stanley kuick 
stanley kramer or luis bunuel .
i am merely registering a protest against the darkness
that pervades this movie from start to finish 
to the extent
that most of the time you simply can not make out what is going on .
i can understand darkness in night scene
but this movie was dark even in oad daylight ,
for what reason i am at loss to understand .
as it is 
however ,
it would not have made much difference
if director becker had filmed it in total darkness .
