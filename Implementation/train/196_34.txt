80 minute ,
and it felt twice that long !
brief crossing is not ief enough .
indeed 
the first 50 minute or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue
( more of a monologue 
really )
of a woman approaching middle age 
tediously droning about `` man 
'' disappointmant 
sex 
aging 
and her recent eakup 
to a french teenager
she met in the ship 's cafeteria.the tedious monologue continues
as they go to duty-free shop ,
and to a bar ,
where finally her self-involved rant push him away .
the `` story '' can not end there ,
of course 
so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more
as she ings him to her cabin.what little romance 
sex 
or for that matter ,
anything at all this film has besides bitter ranting is hardly enough
to justify the price of a rental
unless you are one of those
who love dramas
where nothing interesting happen at all .
yes 
the ending is very nicely done ,
but it is scan not reward to subject yourself to what amount to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.of course ,
some person like it .
i could be wrong .
