what a pathetic movie.i will not waste much time
commenting about it .
i am still trying to get back the couple hour i wasted on it.let me leave
it simply with - shaq has no business
being an actor or singer .
he is utterly without talent at both discpline .
it is a crying shame
that substantially more talented person waste away in community theatre and karaoke bar
while shaq uses his name as a basketball player
to undeservedly get cast in movie
and cut cds.much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent
that is shaq .
