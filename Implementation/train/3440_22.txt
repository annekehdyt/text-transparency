...
but the trouble of this production is that it is very far from a good musical.granted ,
one can not always expect the witty master like sondheim or bernstein or porter ;
yet the music of this piece makes even andrew lloyd webber look witty .
it is deadly dull and uninventive
( with one or two exception )
and just
after i watched
it i could not recall a single significan not melody -
which is rather tragic coming from someone
who learned the whole another hundred person from three listenings.it is also strangely un-theatrical .
it takes place on an incredibly large stage
( one really has to feel sorry for those person in front row
who oke their neck in order to see something happening 50 meter on the right or 100 meter on the left )
and does absolutely nothing with it .
when there is supposed to be one person singing on-stage ,
that is just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty .
for me as an aspiring theatre director
it was almost painful to watch.the fact remains ,
cole porter seems to have captured the french culture in his work better
than these no-talent can ever come close to .
and i am puzzled by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical .
