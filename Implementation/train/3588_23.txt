well it looked good on paper 
nick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again 
this time on a mix of heist movie 
da vinci code 
american history 101 and indiana jone .
but oh dear 
this is to indiana jone what speed 2 is to speed .
a reasonable cast
( including john voight and harvey keitel )
battles against a puerile script
and loses badly .
the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemason.however these freemason are not your usual shopkeeper
who use funny handshake and play golf ,
these freemason are the natural descendant of the knight templar
( and nobody mention 'from hell ' or jack the ripper .
) i do not think
i have revealed any plot spoiler
because there are none .
there is virtually no suspense 
no surprise and no climax-
it just stops .
national treasure aims for dan brown
but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour .
