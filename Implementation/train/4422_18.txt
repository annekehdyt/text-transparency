a cheesy 
compellingly awful
( and not in a fun way )
c grade movie .
everything shouts 'amateur ' 
from the crumby script
( bizarre premise 
limited coherence and predictable ending ;
the turgid lighting 
sound and hand-held wobbly camera angle ; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and reference ; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting .
i saw it on dvd
and kept hoping edward wood would pop out .
all is forgiven -
your worst film are work of art 
and more coherent than this twaddle.but still 
preferable to the warbling 'every night in my dreams i
hear you ' - are you sure
the titanic crew were not involved in this on the side ?
