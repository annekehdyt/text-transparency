i am starting to write this review during a eak as i watch the movie .
it is the first time i have tried doing that ,
but i am having trouble
getting through this one
without occasional eak .
that is not because it is intense
but
because it is bad.it is almost painfully tedious and unbelievable ,
especially when the preternaturally robust dying other ryan
( colm feore )
is on screen
being tragic and bitchy 
self-indulgent and self-pitying .
this would have been a much better movie
if they had just left that character out of the story.he adds nothing but mawkish 
maudlin 
very irritating melodrama .
maybe somebody decided
that
if they could not make ryan believable
they had just make him obnoxious .
the problem with that is :
who cares
if a spoiled 
whining 
obnoxious jerk is dying ?
not me.the only thing this character has going for him is the fact
that he is dying 
and sorry ,
but that is just not enough .
dying does not make anybody special .
we are all dying 
sooner or later .
it does not give anybody the right
to expect sympathy
while acting like a jerk.the other two character ,
and the actor playing them
( david cubitt as theo and chandra west as sarah ) ,
are very much more interesting ,
and their story ,
without ryan 's self-pitying interruption ,
would have made a much better movie .
but it is not over yet ,
and it is time to hit play again .
maybe something great happens before the end ... .nope .
sorry .
this rented turkey goes back tonight !
