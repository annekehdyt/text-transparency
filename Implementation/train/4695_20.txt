it is a hideous little production ,
apt to give one nightmare as well as headach .
it is an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation .
it is weird ,
but it is not the kind of fun ,
weird trip
anyone optimistic might expect .
it is the cold 
inhuman 
unfriendly 
sickening 
even creepy kind of weird .
there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie .
after all 
disney did a fantastic job with the same source material .
and cosgrove-hall did far more attractive thing with stop-motion.interestingly ,
this is a french production .
as such 
it re-enforces the stereotype
that the french have no concept of scary .
