i go to the cinema to be entertained .
there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film .
from beginning to end ,
there is no respite from the gray 
grinding reality of this woman 's life .
it is one-paced 
with no change of mood .
i remained until the end
only because i was convinced that thing must get better .
they do not ,
and i do not think
i was the only one 
as evidenced by the many groan ringing around the cinema
as the film drew mercifully to a close .
honestly
depicting social depravation is no crime ,
but boring your audience to groan is not the way
to win the sympathy of the public .
a dreadful film .
