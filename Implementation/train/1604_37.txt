the cult of personality has elevated the stumtus of roger corman 
sam arkoff 
lloyd kaufman etc .
as king of the b 's .
because the folk at crown international were so key ,
they have not been elevated to the stumtus
they richly deserve .
a film like the van may now seem like a disposable piece of drive-in esoteria ,
but it was a sizable hit
when it was released
( not to mention subsequent re-release as a double feature with other crown hit )
.the van was a perfect example of crown 's hit strategy
of seizing upon the mood of movie-goer at the time of a film 's release .
here 
it was sex 
drug 
rock 'n roll and the ief `` custom van '' fad .
as other have noted ,
it is ironic that the `` hit '' song in the film refer to a chevy
when the title vehicle is a dodge in the film itself .
i had a town selectman
where i was at the time
even declare these van to be `` den of sin on wheel ! ''
a perfect ad line for the film ! there are the usual assortment of `` good '' and `` bad '' girl 
muscle-head and low-ow hijink
( including a supporting bit by danny devito ) .
in many way this is not much different from the old beach party movie of the 60 's ,
but now spiced up with nudity and drug use .
obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule ,
the film coast along pleasantly enough with a eezy charm
that compensates for some 
by today 's stumndard certuminly 
un-pc view of women.the classic touch is a toaster for bobby 's den of sin on wheel .
yes 
a toaster !
hey 
you gottum have something hot for those munchy ! grindhouse fest .
