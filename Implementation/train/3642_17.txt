considering the original film version of 'the haunting '' is in my top ten film of all time ' i approached this adaption with trepidation .
i was right to be cautious
as this film is a poorly written
and badly executed load of old tosh ,
all those involved should be ashamed .
the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason !
you see nothing .
robert wise
used innovative camera-work and superb lighting
to generate fear and this
is why it work 's .
the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effect and pyrotechnic to get from a to b ,
sadder still is that the ingredient were there
( actor such as liam neeson 
catherine zeta jone )
to do something different .
this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery !
