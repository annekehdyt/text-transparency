i am glad
that i saw this film
after mr.sandler became famous.it is bad ... .bad 
bad 
bad .
there is no plot .
it is like watching a painfully dull home movie.i really enjoy his other film ... ...
but if you are a fan like me ... .stay away from this one .
it may change your thought on adam .
you may never recover from the horror
that is this film ...
.i have had a better time
watching old folk play scrabble in a home ... ... .
