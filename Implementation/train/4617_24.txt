standard rise to fame tale
that has a few high point .
number one 
lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning ,
star making performance .
the fact
that she never became a huge sensation after this
is beyond me .
sadly 
she is a supporting character
and we are forced to focus on irena carter 's bland character 
sparkle ,
whose rise to fame is easy 
boring 
and unconvincing .
however ,
whenever the girl go on stage and perform ,
the movie comes back to life .
the original music by curis mayfield must be praised .
the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape .
the picture quality was pretty low 
as well as the production value i am guessing .
all in all 
its worth a gander .
