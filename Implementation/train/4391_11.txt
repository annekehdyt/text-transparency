former at pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe star in a film
set in a high security american prison .
i had a gut feeling
his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reason like tobias in the first series of oz 
but proximity isn`t
that kind of film 
it`s more like a `` man on the run `` film like the fugitive .
it also makes a nod to the theme of punishment and justice with jame coburn
putting in a cameo
as the spokesman for a justice for victim pressure group
but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminal is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old clich of shoot out and car chase
