the fact
that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list
should not have mattered
if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent .
instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequence featuring picturesque beggar and whore ,
and the final alienation is accomplished
by pulling back
to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage ,
appropriately enough for a production
that is more lionel 'oliver ' blair than brecht .
the acting talent is shamefully misused :
migene and walter are good
but do not have to try very hard :
migene at least has a great voice and some feel for the material .
julia looks perfect as mack ,
but struggles with the character ,
straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent .
harris 's peachum is embarrassingly mannered
and polly is atrocious .
the adaptation of lyric 
script and music are often awkward :
it was a bad move
to base the film on marc blitzstein 's bowdlerised broadway version ,
but at least his word were singable ,
unlike most of what is been interpolated in gesture of faithfulness .
and the attempt at overcoming the low budget
by filming at claustrophobic angle on mist-shrouded set lit in garish blue and orange as if by some bargain-basement vittorio storaro fails utterly
-- the film just looks cheap 
shoddy and thoughtlessly made .
disgraceful .
