the movie itself is not too bad ;
many comment have pointed out the obvious flaw of the script ,
but it is watchable .
what really gives me the creep though is that person like justin timberlake even get cast for movie ,
and on top of that for movie like this one .
i have to admit
i had never heard the man 's name
before watching this ,
but the very instant he appeared i
was just plain annoyed .
the voice is crap ,
the face is a bad rip-off of legola ,
the posture is horrible ,
and he can not even properly coordinate all three of them .
said to say ,
i was delighted
when he got jumped
after leaving the disco ,
because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only .
too bad i was wrong .
these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance ,
and they are the main reason
i give this a 4. i see many upcoming movie with the little timberlake cast ...
and can not believe it .
