i go to a lot of movie 
often i ing my 5 year old son ,
i am
so glad i did not ing him to this one .
there are many reference to sex and a skinny dipping scene 
however ,
that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it .
the trailer lead you to believe
it is a light-hearted comedy ;
nevertheless ,
virtually all of the funny moment are in the preview .
i kept waiting for it to get interesting 
funny 
or anything but serious ; however 
i nearly fell asleep
as the plot-less story dragged on .
i understand
that dog can be great company ,
that
being said ,
the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog
that the owner were not savvy enough to train .
if a human caused this much damage and mayhem
that person would be banned .
the worst movie i have ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson 
a waste of their talent .
the best way
to sum up this movie is ,
couple gets unruly dog ,
couple fall in love with dog 
dog dy 
couple sad .
the end .
