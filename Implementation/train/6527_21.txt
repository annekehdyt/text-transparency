i enjoyed this movie a lot .
i thought
that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history .
there is always that woman
that does what she needs to do to climb the class system .
i feel
that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly
and could of not been done better .
what i enjoyed most was when she realized
what love really was .
throughout the movie all of the man
that fell for her were in love with her ,
had given her everything ,
even lost their career for her .
until she had met cortland ,
she did not understand
why these man gave up everything for happiness .
the way her life had ended up
was far from what she expected to be possible .
i would recommand this movie to anyone of a mature audience
so you are able to understand the content and the under-laying meaning of the movie and plot .
