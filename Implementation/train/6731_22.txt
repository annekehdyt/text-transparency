hayao miyazaki has no equal
when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling ,
yet often he is being compared to walt disney .
that is just so unfair ,
because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki 's film
that he is the superior artist .
he really has a gift of thrilling both grownup and child ,
and laputa is indeed one awesome ride.but
where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and eathtaking !
miyazaki 's work have never cease to amaze me .
laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder
how a film can be so packed with detail and imagination .
ask yourself this question :
if you are a kid
dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical ,
what would it be like ?
the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa ,
because it is truly a childhood fantasy come true .
every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequence ...
and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself .
not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi !
everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here .
