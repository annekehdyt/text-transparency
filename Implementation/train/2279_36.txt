a friend lent me this dvd ,
which he got from the director at a festival ,
i think .
i went in warned
that some of the technical aspect of the movie were a bit shaky
and that the writing was good but not great .
so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie.the standouts where the actor .
youssef kerkor was really good as ernie 
the main character 
kind of pathetic in a likable way .
adam jone
( who also directed )
and justin lane were excellent as the roommate
who drive ernie mad .
the bill character
( justin lane ) ,
who spends a lot of the film
dressed like a panda ,
was by far my favorite ;
he seemed the least one-dimensional ,
and reminded me of an old college roommate
so much i
called the guy
after watching the dvd .
really kind of lovable 
and very funny .
some of the other acting was good ,
some was so-so ,
but none of it was bad .
i also really liked the vigilante duo .
ridiculous and funny.i am giving this one high mark ,
even though it has some issue ,
because you can tell
when you watch it that these person cared ,
and decided to make their movie their way .
well done to adam jone and crew .
