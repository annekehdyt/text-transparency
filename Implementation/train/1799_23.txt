judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukor 's film version of `` born yesterday 
''
and from that point forward 
her career consisted of trying to find material good enough
to allow her to strike gold again.it
never happened .
in `` it should happen to you ''
( i can not think of a blander title 
by the way ) ,
holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde
who 's maybe not so dumb after all ,
but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted .
even jack lemmon ,
in what i believe was his first film role ,
can not muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy .
the audience knows
how the movie will end virtually from the beginning ,
so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film
to catch up.maybe
if you are enamored of holliday you
will enjoy this ;
otherwise i would not bother.grade :
