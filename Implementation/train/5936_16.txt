the sword fighting was out of this world ,
the fight scene spectacular
without the flying on a wire technique
( until the end )
that are way too common today .
the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie .
the character in the assault on the bad guy mansion were clich\u00e9
but the movie is comfortable with it .
an injection of humour from woo.the plot with it is twist
and turn was unpredictable and exciting
and you could not tell
who was good or bad
or which side person were on .
a good sense of suspense and well timed surprise .
the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre
and reaches you in way most kung-fu flick do not .
