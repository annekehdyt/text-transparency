i never saw this
when i was a kid ,
so this was seen with fresh eye .
i had never heard of it
and rented it for my 5 year old daughter .
plus 
the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious .
the special fx are cheesy
and the singing and dancing is mediocre .
but the story is great .
my daughter was entranced .
i loved watching walken in this role
thinking about what the future held for him .
very amusing to see him dance !
and if the song were not great ,
at least they were not disney over-produced saccharine sweetness .
the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her ,
and she was a little nervous
when we saw him again at the end ,
but it was mostly benign .
interestingly 
we had recently read `` puss in boot '' ,
and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story .
but
while staying true to almost every aspect ,
walken 's acting made it believable .
great fun .
i would watch it again with my daughter .
