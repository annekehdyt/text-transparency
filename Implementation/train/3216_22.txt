raising victor vargas is a movie
you definitely need to see .
it was very heart felt
and had a lot of humor
that gets you sucked right in .
it is so much like real life with what teenager have to go through .
victor 
a cocky teen 
but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right place
dealing with girl and family .
at the end victor learns the true meaning of love
after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl
who he wants to use
is actually using him too.i recommend person to watch this movie
because it will be like you are watching a real family .
thats how much feeling this movie has .
one heart felt moment was
when victor 's grandmother throws victor out over something simple .
victor was really heart and could not believe
that she would do something like that .
it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real .
overall i give this movie a b+
