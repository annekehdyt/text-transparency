beautifully done .
a lot of angst .
friendhip may not endure all ,
but in the end it is all that matter 
or so a group of friend learn .
i have watched it over and over again .
the music is also amazing .
when kei loses the one friend
he has he gives up
until he meets sho 
an orphan boy
who is not repelled by his true nature .
in the lawless street of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian race ,
and learn
that sometimes being on top can cost you more
than you are ever ready to pay .
a surprise ending
that grips as much as the whole movie does .
i could not get enough of it .
gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting ,
proving
they are more than pretty boy
who sing .
