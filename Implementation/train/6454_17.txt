i think
it is time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him .
this series is getting old
and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer .
ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies .
vietnam was not a fun place
to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood
making it seem like it was .
this is not the worst of the film concerning vietnam ,
that honor goes to john wayne green beret .
in any case john rambo
carrying around a 50 cal machine gun
taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good many russian
is an insult to watch .
what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the end ... please ! !
oh yeah i heard
they are making another one ...
