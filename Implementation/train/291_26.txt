i saw the mst3k version of `` deathstalker iii ''
and loved the movie so much
-- even `` unmystied '' --
that i decided to watch the entire series of `` deathstalker '' film .
i bought i and ii
and settled down for a laugh.nothing about `` deathstalker i '' was funny on any level
and when the credit rolled i was embarrassed and regretful
that i had bought it !
too much ugliness and nudity .
i guess
either `` ds 3 '' was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot
because i expected something similar 
i.e .
stupid and carefree and simple .
i was wrong .
even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money .
i did not even open `` ds 2 ''
as i will return it tomorrow .
now i will probably just throw away this dvd as i can not return it and no one wants it
-- including myself !
so really ,
do not bother with this one .
even the nudity
( lot of it 
btw )
is uninspiring and icky .
