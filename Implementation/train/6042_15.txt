oh my gosh i live in kentucky
and when mellisa joan hart came to louisville
she went right through my neighborhood
and waved at me i am filthy rich
so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and i love being rich any way
she came for the derby back to my interest in the show ... ...
that show makes you want to point your finger at something
and make it disappear i mean it is just so creative and i love it i would love to be on that show ... ... . that show is just amazing i mean
who ever came up with that show i want to just give them a big kiss i mean
it makes me feel better
when i am sick
and makes me happy
when i am mad i mean
if someone tell me
they do not like it i will talk some sense in to you ok ok
