'presque rien ' is a story of two young boy
falling in love during summer stay by the seaside .
i do not want to tell the plot ,
because it is not what is most important about this film
( but you can be sure
that it is interesting and original ) .
the best part of this movie is the cinematography .
the visual side of 'presque rien ' is so amazing it deserves highest note .
it leaves you charmed with its beauty.as for the plot ,
it is shown in uneven 
rather complicated way .
there is no simple chronology
nor there are answer to all the question the film ings .
but this is what makes 'presque rien ' even more interesting .
i recommend this movie to all the person
for whom the artistic side of film is very important
and they will not be disappointed .
