given
that this movie was put together in less than a year
might explain its shortness
( 81 minute -
including end credit ,
so roughly 76 minute of actual film ) .
but what it can not explain is its lack of humor
that the previous film possessed.the gag are quick
and sometimes not even funny .
the only true funny part are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spot 
jame wood ' portrayal of max van sydow 's character in the exorcist ,
and bit and piece scattered throughout the film .
very unfunny was the take off of charlie 's angel ,
which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene ,
basically recreated the scene
without much humor injected into it.today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gag of the classic supernatural horror film of the 70 's such as the exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' poltergeist 
et .
al.hopefully scary movie 3 will take some time
to put together ,
making the spoofs more enjoyable.one thing though 
the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna faris
( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) .
just for her casting and acting ability 
i give this movie a `` 3 '' out of `` 10 '' .
