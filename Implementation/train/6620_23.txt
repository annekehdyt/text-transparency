i watched this film ,
along with every other adaptation i could get my hand on-
including seeing plays- in preparation for some academic research .
the cinematography is very moving ,
as is the music .
unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story .
i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr. rochester .
all of his most fundamental trait are gone .
where is his wit ?
where is his passion ?
scott 's rochester more closely resembles rochester 's foil 
st.john 
than the character from the novel .
in fact 
the actor playing st.john in this adaptation played a passionate st.john
while scott is content to smash thing or just stare at the ceiling
( which he does all the time ) .
i have no idea
what they were thinking .
i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote
based on the wonderful music and cinematography
but i honestly can not bear to see this film for too long
because of george c. scott 's performance .
