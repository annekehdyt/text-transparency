how strange the human mind is ;
this center of activity wherein perception of reality are formed and stored ,
and in which one 's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the ain 
this most delicate and intricate processor of all thing sensory .
and how much do we really know of it is inner-workings ,
of it is depth or capacity ?
what is it in the mind
that allows us to discern between reality and a dream ?
or can we ?
perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see ,
like looking at a painting by monet ,
in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality .
it is a concept
visited by filmmaker cameron crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film 
`vanilla sky 
' starring tom cruise and penelope cruz .
at the age of thirty-three 
david aame
( cruise )
inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father .
his fifty-one percent controlling interest 
however 
has made him something of a marked man ,
as there are seven member of his board of director ,
and each deems himself more worthy than the young mr. aame of the lion 's share of the company .
and fueling the fire of discontent is their perception
that david lacks the focus the job requires.admittedly 
david like to play ; still 
he is in control of the business
and does what he sees fit ,
whether the board
( he refers to them as the `seven dwarfs ' )
like it or not ,
and no one has ever had the courage
to challenge him directly .
but during a lavish birthday party in his honor 
one of the corporate lawyer 
thomas tipp
( timothy spall )
warns david
that the seven are up to something behind his back .
at the time 
however 
it is the last thing on david 's mind ;
he is been having a casual affair with a friend 
julie gianni
( cameron diaz ) ,
but even that moves to the back burner
when he meets a woman at his party
that he can not get out of his mind .
her name is sofia
( penelope cruz ) ,
and after knowing her for only one night ,
she becomes a pivotal part of his life
-- which is about to be turned upside down ,
as on the morning after his party he makes a decision
that will change his life forever .
and he is about to learn that sometimes ,
there is simply no going back.director cameron crowe has crafted
and delivered much more than just another film with this one ;
far more than a movie 
`vanilla sky ' is a vision realized .
beginning with the first image
that appear on screen ,
he presents a visually stunning experience
that is both viscerally and cereally affecting .
it is a mind-twisting mystery
that will swallow you up and sweep you away ;
emotionally ,
it is a rush
-- and it may leave you exhausted ,
because it requires some effort
to stay with it .
but it is worth it .
think `memento ' with a driving rock n ' roll soundtrack and a viant assault of color
proffered by the stroke of an impressionist 's ush .
there is darkness and light ,
and sounds that pound and drive
until you can feel the blood rushing
through your vein and throbbing in your ain .
and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath
that ever expanding vanilla sky .
simply put 
this one 's a real trip ;
it is exciting
-- and it is a mind bender.as to the performance here 
those
who can not get past the mind-set of tom cruise as maverick in `top gun 
' or his ethan hunt in `mission impossible 
' or those
who perceive him only as a `movie star ' rather than an actor ,
are going to have to think again in light of his work here .
because as david aame ,
cruise gives the best performance of his career 
one
that should check any doubt
as to his ability as an actor at the door .
he is made some interesting career choice the past few year 
with film like `magnolia ' and `eye wide shut ' merely warm-up for the very real and complex character
he creates here .
and give him credit 
too ,
for taking on a role
that dispels any sense of vanity ;
this is cruise
as you have never seen him before .
`jerry maguire ' earned him an oscar nomination ,
and this one should 
also
-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peer .
cruise is not just good in this movie ,
he is remarkable.penelope cruz turns in an outstanding ,
if not exceptional performance 
as well 
as sofia 
the woman of david 's dream .
there is an alluring innocence
she ings to this role
that works well for her character
and makes her forthcoming and accessible ,
yet she lacks any hint of mystery
that may have added
that special `something extra ' to the part .
but crowe knows how to get the best out of his actor ,
and he certainly did with cruz.he also knew
what he was doing with cameron diaz ,
who is absolutely viant in the role of julie .
she is never looked better 
and fairly sizzle on screen .
but make no mistake ,
this is no `window-dressing ' part ,
and diaz deliver a complete package with this character .
the quality of her performance can be measured ,
in fact 
in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time .
and it is the persona
she integrates so fully with her innate beauty
that makes julie so unforgettable .
overall 
a terrific job by diaz.the
supporting cast includes kurt russell
( dr. mccabe ) ,
jason lee
( brian ) ,
johnny galecki
( peter ) ,
armand schultz
( dr. pomerantz ) ,
noah taylor
( ed ) ,
mel thompson
( `l.e . '
man ) 
jean carol
( woman in new york )
and john fedevich
( silent ed ) .
about half-way through 
this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality ;
but rest assured 
by the end of `vanilla sky ' all will be revealed .
it is a reality-bender ,
to be sure ,
and a wild one ;
but this is exciting entertainment
that offers a satisfying
-- and unique -- experience 
one you have to see to believe .
it is the essential 
and absolute 
magic of the movie .
10/10 .
