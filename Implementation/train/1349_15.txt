after seeing the terrible 
terrible 
terrible batman :
dead end i knew i
had to see this as soon
as i heard about it.pressing play
to view the trailer i
thought
i was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker
trying to ing new depth to an existing character .
but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie
that sadly does not exist ,
as i would love to see a finished movie
even if it was only 30 minute long.world 's finest makes up for batman :
dead end and then some.i look forward to the next short !
