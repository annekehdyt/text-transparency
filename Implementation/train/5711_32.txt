this is one of the most overlooked gem hollywood
has ever produced .
-- a young wwii british fighter ace
whose plane is about to crash ,
has radio contact with a young american woman
who comforts the ave pilot ,
knowing
that within minute he will be dead .
for some reason the man
who should certainly be dead walk away from the wreckage and eventually learns
that he was meant to report to heaven .
when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven 
the man refuses and demand to have his `` day in court ''
to argue his case .
the man argues
that his situation had changed during the final moment of his earthly life ,
that
he had fallen in love
and therefor had become a different person 
one
who deserved a chance
to live on .
the `` heavenly court '' is a cinematic delight !
the `` announcement of the jury of peer '' is a definite highlight .
the story ,
as fantastic as it seems ,
is an engaging one
and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hour play time .
the final scene is simply beautiful
and will require a `` kleenex treatment '' for most viewer .
this film is in my personal all-time favorite top 10 ,
it has my highest recommendation !
