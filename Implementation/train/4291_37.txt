a bdsm `` sub-culture '' of los angele serve as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess ,
plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player 
celium xavier ,
who also produces and script
while performing a dual role as twin sister vanessa and celium .
a question soon develops
as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera ,
lighting and editing pyrotechnic can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative
that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer .
celium is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angele ,
while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure
within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performance upon cd-rom ,
but
when disaster befalls `` mistress vanessa '' 
virtuous celium ,
determined to unearth her sister 's vicious attacker ,
begins a new job as a `` sex slave '' at the private castle club
where the specialty of the house is a `` dungeon party '' .
two fbi field agent
( whose deployment to the vanessa case
is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm site ) ,
in addition to a los angele police department homicide detective 
are assigned to investigate the crime ,
while endeavouring to provide security for celium
whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customer
as to have created condition of personal danger for her .
flaw in logic and continuity abound ,
such as a homicide being allocated to l.a.p.d .
's operations-south bureau 
a region of the metropolis
that is far removed from the setting of the film .
direction is unfocused
and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction .
the mentioned photographic gymnastic culminate with a batty montage near the movie 's end of prior footage
that is but tangentially referent to the scenario .
one solid acting turn appears among this slag :
stan abe as a zealous fbi agent .
