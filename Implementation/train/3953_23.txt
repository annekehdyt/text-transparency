i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne 's `` waitress ''
( 2007 ) .
this movie only confirms
what was clear from that movie .
adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director 
an original and unique artist .
she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency .
ally sheedy steal this movie with a terrific performance as a woman
who has fallen over the edge .
male lead reg rodger ,
looking like judd nelson ,
is fine .
there is also a great cameo by ben vereen .
the song at the end of the movie `` the bastard song ''
written by adrienne
can stand as her optimistic eulogy :
`` it is a world of suffering 
in a sea of pain 
no matter how much sun you ing ,
you are pummeled by the rain ...
do not let the heartless get you down ,
do not greet the heartless at your door ,
do not live among the heartless ''
