what a wonderful 
fanciful movie `` stardust '' is.i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say ,
one could take it as a very strong recommendation
to go see it.at a time
when hollywood seems bent on forcing remake and sequel down our throat ,
`` stardust '' makes us remember
why we go to the movie in the first place -
to escape reality for a couple of hour and explore other life 
other time 
or other planet .
ironically 
`` stardust '' takes us to all three place effortlessly
and with a childlike glee we all long for .
`` stardust '' is full of all the character
we remember as child :
prince 
witch 
pirate 
ghost and scoundrel .
it has the damsel in distress 
the hero 
the rogue 
the obstacle 
spell 
antidote 
charm 
and even a touch of light-speed
to make it quasi modern .
`` stardust '' is about a man from the town of wall ,
which is conveniently situated next to a wall
that separates their town from a magical kingdom .
the only way past the wall is through a eech
that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger
( played wonderfully by david kelly ) .
one day a young man from wall
named ben barne out maneuver the old guard and escapes through the eech .
he happens upon an enchanted kingdom
called stormhold
where he meets a chained
( and very sexy )
young lady named una .
she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an uneakable chain .
while the witch is away ,
una seduce ben
and sends him on his way .
ben return to wall
without incident
and continues his life .
but nine month later he is summoned to the wall eech
where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.the boy ,
named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man
( charlie cox )
who is smitten with a girl way out of his league
and also betrothed to another .
nevertheless 
the young lady
( named victoria and played sienna miller )
goes out once with tristain
and he confesses his love to her .
after they espy a falling star ,
she tells him
he can have her if
he retrieves the star and ings it back to her .
he agrees
and sets out on his quest ,
which will take him to the other side of the wall.meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold 
the old king
( perfectly played by peter o'toole )
is dying .
he calls his remaining living son to tell them
who shall succeed him to the throne .
his son ' name are primus 
secondus 
sextmus 
and septimus .
the other son where killed by the other other in a humorous competition
to see who life to get the throne.anyway ,
he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila ,
that what ings the star to earth.the star crash in the form of a beautiful woman
named yvaine
( clare dane )
and she 
of course 
is wearing the charm .
but little does she know
she is now being persuaded by tristain 
the prince ,
and also an aging witch named lamia
( michelle pfeiffer )
who wants to cut out the star heart
to regain her own youth.complicated ?
yes .
but it all comes together
as the adventure unfolds.tristain is the first
to find yvaine
but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria
he does not recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine .
his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love .
but he must get past the prince and lamia first .
the prince are not that big an issue
as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in `` pirate of the caribbean '' - never has death been so funny .
but tristain also encounters the witch
who enslaved his mother
( though he does not know
it is his mother )
and a band of flying pirate
led by robert deniro.his
is the most important character in the movie and deniro play it to a tee .
he steals the movie with his toughness
and soon we learn an undercover secret
that will leave audience on the floor with laughter .
though his role is small in length ,
deniro is extraordinary !
michelle pfeiffer is wonderful
as lamia - a sexy evil witch .
claire dane is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine .
she makes a perfect damsel .
jason flemyng 
adam buston 
rupert everett 
and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting prince whom ,
as they die return as ghost ala `` blithe spirit '' and `` high spirit '' .moreover director matthew vaughn ,
whose only other directing experience was `` layer cake '' 
weaves an enchanting tale
that everyone will enjoy .
`` stardust '' may be too complex for young child ,
but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple time .
it is that good .
`` stardust '' is what movie are supposed to be .
perfectly written 
perfectly cast 
perfectly directed 
and perfectly acted .
in other word ... perfect .
