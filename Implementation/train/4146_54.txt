i just bought the dvd
and i must say ,
( after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas )
terry does it again .
as well of being a fan of the monty python movie ,
terry gilliam 's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller ,
whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as jame cole ,
and as well
( perhaps my favorite character )
brad pitt
who played the insanity of jefferey goine .
a must have for sci fi fan 
or movie fan of any type really ,
because it includes suspense 
drama 
action 
etc .
any way the plot 
in the future 
1 % of the world 's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race ,
which is unleashed in the past by `` the army of twelve monkey '' .
jame cole
( bruce willis )
is sent back to 1996
( which is when the virus was unleashed )
to find out about the disease ,
so scientist in his time can find a cure .
before i go further 
jame cole life in an underground society ,
and the animal rule the world on the surface due to the disease
that will kill the human .
anyway
when he is sent back in time
he is actually sent back to 1990
where he is sent to a mental institution
because of his telling to person of the virus .
during his stay he meets jefferey goin
( brad pitt )
who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race .
he also meets his psychiatrist
( ( madelein stowe )
who eventually teams up with bruce
to save the world
( as she sees
that he is correct in his telling ) ,
he is sent back and forth from his time to the past
and eventually sent to 1996
where he then question his own sanity
but later pull through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax ,
where he tries to stop the man
carrying the virus
( not actually brad pitt )
and is instead shot by the police
as the killer gets away .
