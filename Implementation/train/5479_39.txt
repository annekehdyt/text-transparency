the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 bakhtiari person and their animal on the summer migration to winter grazing .
the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a `` forgotten person ''
and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the `` roaring twenty . ''
a more drastic contrast could not be imagined .
raging river and barefoot mountain crossing are utally realistic and the animal
that disappear under the water do in fact die .
to make sure
that the audience of the time believed
that the story took place ,
a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end .
the version
that i saw had fascinating iranian music
that can stand alone
and be appreciated
without the film .
having said
all this 
the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening 's entertainment .
the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shot
that
they recorded
and there is no fancy camera work
resulting from multiple re-take .
the western inter-title detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record
since they demonstrate
how hollywood tried to put their spin on the life of an indigenous persons life
so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day .
off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a `` policeman 's ball . ''
the producer went on to make the docu-drama chang
( 1927 )
and the totally commercial king kong
( 1933 ) .
the migration theme is used again in person of the wind
( 1976 )
and in himalaya
( 1999 ) .
recommended for those
who know in advance what they are getting into
-- and then highly recommended for them .
