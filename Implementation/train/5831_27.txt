mysterious murder in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde
plaguing the terrified community.this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic picture 
one of hollywood 's poverty row studio .
the sparse production value and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere
and lend it an almost expressionistic quality .
overall 
it leaves the viewer the feeling
of being caught up in a bad dream ,
which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort.even
though the eventual explanation for the hideous crime is quite ludicrous
and is not given proper plot development ,
the film can boast of a good cast .
grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performance 
this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle .
beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role
which requires her to do little more than look lovely and alarmed .
dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed polouse inspector
who also happens to be 
conveniently ,
miss wray 's boyfriend.maude eburne ,
who could be extremely funny
given the right situation 
steals most of her scene as miss wray 's hypochondriac aunt .
elderly lionel belmore plays the village 's terrified burgermeister .
and little dwight frye ,
who will always be remembered for his weird role in the frankenstein and dracula film ,
here is most effective as a bat-loving lunatic .
