really 
i liked it .
the premise was good ,
the story fit
where both respective series left off ,
and here is my favorite part .
mary and valerie are not bitter !
they are not like other
who become synonymous with a certain series
and then refuse to talk about it ,
or do possible reunion
( a prime example is susan dey 
`` the partridge family '' ) .
in fact 
valerie was saying
that she had be thrilled to do another movie ,
and then mary said
the same thing later 
so i would be on the look for another ...
but if that does not quite work out ,
then they can re-run this one .
