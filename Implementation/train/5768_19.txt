this movie deserves credit for its original approach .
it combines element of theater 
film 
and epic storytelling .
unfortunately 
it falls flat on all level .
the film biggest weakness is it is unwillingness to commit to anything ;
it has camp 
moralistic 
and epic element
without ever committing to any of them .
as for the story itself 
chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation
which turns the lovable 
unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.most likely two type of person will see this 
francophiles or arthuriophile .
speaking as one of the latter ,
i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby 
disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .
