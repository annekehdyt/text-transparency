this may have been based on historical event ,
and we know
that the maker of this tv docu-drama took liberty
to make it more dramatic - i
can live with that -
but it was just so badly done !
i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid-air crisis
how calm everyone seemed ,
surely someone would have panicked ,
and what a smooth flight 
no passenger discomfort apparent - come on !
not sure about the regulation ,
nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems ott nonsense ,
but why take your shoe off before the emergency landing ,
common sense tells
me this is not a good idea !
the shot of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake .
in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby 
in this movie
it was out of proportion
and looked like the model
it probably was .
escape slide appeared at the front and mid emergency door ,
yet nobody appeared to exit from the front ,
even though the drop was much less .
the captain went back into the plane
after the landing - why ?
this was never explained .
we know
the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel ,
but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tank ,
and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger ,
yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely ,
and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slide instead of getting as far away as possible ,
as i am
sure
i would have done .
there were just too many inconsistency 
error and faked action in this .
i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time 
and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed .
it had the potential
to be quite thrilling ,
but doubtless due to the budget restriction failed ,
and made one feel
that a plane losing all engine was no big deal really ,
and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing ,
but no real danger !
- the reality of course being somewhat different !
