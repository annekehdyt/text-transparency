the plot has already been described by other reviewer ,
so i will simply add
that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see gaielle drake in all her undoubted glory.miss drake has to be one of the sexiest 
prettiest example of `` posh totty ''
to have been committed to celluloid .
of her era and ilk 
only the equally exquisite jane asher comes close .
what was it about actress with musical other ?
( nick drake and peter asher )
for those
who like me
have admired gaielle ,
her scene in this movie will not disappoint .
she has a magnificent figure
and none of it is left to the imagination here.as a whole ,
the movie is very poor
and being of its time 
very cheaply made .
the song
that covers the opening credit
seems to go on forever and is appalling .
