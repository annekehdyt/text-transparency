the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery ,
which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plot ever .
powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30 's ,
and arthur has a unique voice
which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bell .
they are extremely fun to watch ,
so take the ashness of the plot with a grain of salt
and just enjoy seeing it unfold .
eric blore also has some comic turn as powell 's butler.powell 's contract with mgm included a clause
which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio ,
but he wanted to work again with arthur
and he liked the script ,
so he eagerly accepted the assignment .
they had worked together in two 1929 paramount film 
the canary murder case and the greene murder case 
both in the philo vance series .
