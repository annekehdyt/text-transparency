when i saw the commercial for this ,
i was all about seeing it .
now 
forgive me ,
but it is been so long since i have seen it
that i do not recall how it went .
suffice it to say ,
the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the `` movie ''
they sold me on.i
was bored 
annoyed ,
and incredibly
disappointed by this movie .
and if it was not bad enough ,
they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music .
not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie 
eh mon ?
i guess
if you never saw the commercial
( or trailer 
i suppose )
you may think
this is some hot stuff .
for my money 
the commercial was way better .
