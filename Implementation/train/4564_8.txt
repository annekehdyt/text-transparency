when i learned of sir alec guinness ' death ,
this was the first of his many film i
thought of re-seeing .
what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these year .
and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame .
his eye and face are as luminous
as that white suit he wears .
both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorite .
