if this is based on the true-life relationship ,
as purported 
between ms. curtin and mr. levinson 
i am thrilled i do not know them personally .
this is painfully slow ,
and both character take stupid pill liberally throughout the movie
while the theme song gets played into the ground .
many stupid scene with person
acting stupid does not make for a comedy .
