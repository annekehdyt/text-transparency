as a long-time fan of superman from the comic 
through the 1950s series 
the first two of the chris reeves film and lois and clark 
and finally smallville 
i was *really* hoping for something clever with `` superman return '' .instead we got lex luthor making *another* attempt at real-estate conversion 
another superman-beaten-up-while-wearing-kryptonite sequence 
and internal inconsistency :
he could not stop himself falling into the ocean
when stuck with 6 '' of kryptonite ,
but when lois eak off 3 '' of it ,
*leaving the rest embedded in him* ,
he can lift *a continent* into space ? ?
really 
the only hero in the story was lois ' partner - i can not remember his name off-hand .
he did all kind of life-saving 
heroic thing with nothing but gut and skill - no superpower 
no invulnerability ... just a normal human.they keep making superman so small .
why can not we have superman battling brainiac or fighting
to save the universe from general zod instead of lex 's petty scheme .
oh 
i forgot ...
they are doing that in smallville.yeah ... i think
i will stick to smallville ...
you probably should 
too ...
