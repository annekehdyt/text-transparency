i really 
really wanted to like julian po .
i think
that slater is underrated as an actor ,
and that many of the supporting player here are better
than they are given a chance
to demonstrate in this film .
i realize this is based on a short story
which i have not read .
so 
i do not know
if what i see as the film 's fault originated with the story ,
or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter .
the premise is wonderful ,
and i loved the voiceover ,
confessional tone the opening narration strike .
but then ... ?
nothing !
several of the cliched local character ask julian pointblank to explain his intention
to commit suicide .
one could argue
that he does not answer ,
because it is none of their business .
but julian is the one
who 
under only token pressure 
blurted out his intention in public .
then neither julian nor the director/writer ,
despite the fact
that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god 's sake ,
seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scan not initial information on julian 's life .
he says
he was a bookkeeper .
he says
his family moved around
when he was a child ,
due to his father 's job .
so what ?
there are several interaction with the local
which seem designed to illuminate julian 's purpose .
but none of them go anywhere ,
because julian seems to regard all these dopey local
as if they were alien from another planet ,
as if he were the ultimate
( and only )
sane one among them .
this might work as an allegory ,
if julian po had any defining characteristic or anything approaching wisdom to impart .
the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene
in which he purposely humiliates the naive 
religious wife of the mechanic .
and what this scene reveal is not anything
that would inspire empathy for julian .
i can only see the julian character
-- as rendered --
as selfish 
petty 
and totally condescending .
sort of match the attitude of the director of this half-baked 
contrived film .
and poor michael park 
an actor
who once had so much promise ,
is given nothing to work with here .
