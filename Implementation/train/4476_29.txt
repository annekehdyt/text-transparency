the young victorium is a beautiful film
and has presented queen victorium in a different light
to what everyone thinks about her .
the film wipes away the `` i am not amused '' impression of queen victorium and shows
she was a cheerful young woman.as i love history 
particularly victoriumn history ,
you can imagine my reaction
when i first saw this film advertised ,
i was so so so excited
and counted down the day
until it came to the cinemas .
i was a little worried
that it would not be historically accurate ,
but it was and i loved it .
i found out new fact about queen victorium
that did not know
before
and it interested me greatly.queen victorium in many light was one of our all time greatest monarchs ,
and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like .
she was treated so badly by her mother adviser sir john conroy ,
because he wanted britain to have a regency .
this was what inspired victorium to be a fantastic queen ,
which she was !
the romance between her and albert was so deep
and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend ,
who were both illiant !
the young victorium is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history ...
i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
10/10 ... no doubt !
