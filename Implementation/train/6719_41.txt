this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue .
what dialogue there is appears in word baloon
as it would in the manga .
the plot of this is existent
but only vaguely accounted for .
there is an issue of the manga
on which this is based available in english in the blast book collection 
'comic underground japan ' ,
and it has actual captioned dialogue
that explains the plot a bit more than here .
i recommend checking
that volume out if you liked this ,
as it explains some of the `` plot '' of the movie ,
which is otherwise inexplicable .
animation wise this is pretty decent ,
good unintrusive use of computer and the image are for the most part realized well .
it jumps in and out of episode ,
as the character 
a cat and his ain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd image :
a boat 
a circus 
a desert .
for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plot and setting ,
which leads me to believe
that the director chose a number of issue of the long-running manga to adapt at random 
but primarilly selected visually .
knowing what is going on might somewhat increase appreciation .
this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff
they used to play on the mtv show 
cartoon sushi 
in particular a short
that feature a cat chasing a man 's severed butt-cheek around the house .
only in this case the cat resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other theme [
though not all that easy to tell what is going on ] .
the dvd of this has director 's commentary and a `` making of '' feature ,
but i can not comment on those
because i didnt get around to them .
i am
giving this a 8/10 for now ,
here is not much to compare it to in anime ,
and i hope for more like this .
