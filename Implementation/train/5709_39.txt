in a penitentiary 
four prisoner occupy a cell :
carr\u00e8re
( g\u00e9rald laroche ) ,
who used his company to commit a fraud
and was betrayed by his wife ;
the drag lassalle
( philippe laudenbach )
and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e

one night 
carr\u00e8re finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell .
they realize
that the book was written by danver
( geoffrey carey )
in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic .
they decide to read
and use its content to escape from the prison ,
when they find the truth about danver ' fate .
`` mal\u00e9fique '' is an original 
intriguing and claustrophobic french low-budget horror movie .
the story is practically in the same location ,
does not have any clich\u00e9s and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene .
i am a great fan of french cinema 
usually romance 
dramas and police story ,
but i noted
that recently i have seen some good french horror movie 
such as `` un jeu d ' enfant '' 
`` belphegor '' and `` dead end '' .
my vote is seven.title
( brazil ) :
`` sinais do mal ''
( `` sign of the evil '' )
