what can be said about mr. moore ?
he is the godfather of rap ,
he is the king of the z-level blaxploitation flick ,
and here 
he is back as his most famous character 
dolemite !
can you dig it ?
this movie is one whacked-out roller-coaster ride of politically incorrect humor 
trippy kung-fu 
nudity 
cheese 
violence 
and a whole lot of other stuff
you would never find in most modern movie
( or any movie ,
really 
haha ! ) .
the stand-up routine
he gives early on is not to be missed !
at any rate 
d2 is definitely an entertaining way
to waste an hour or so .
dolemite :
`` he think
he is bad
and are not got no class !
i am gon ' rock this shotgun up his *beep* a** ! ''
