a definite no .
a resounding no .
this movie is an absolute dud.having been recommended to me by a friend very much into `` that sort of thing 
''
i watched this movie with some anticipation
of being informed 
changed 
moved 
altered 
uplifted 
and all the other positive mystical thing
that could happen to me
when i suddenly see the truth .
now this may sound like someone
who is already predisposed to poo-pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical 
the metaphysical/physical boundary of existence .
believe me ,
i am not such a person .
i try to be open about any presentation
and then decide accordingly.in term of content ,
the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative ,
was the bit about peptide 
emotion 
addiction 
and cellular receptor .
that was the only `` unifying '' element i could find in the documentary part of this film .
the rest of the documentary rambled around several topic
and never seemed to unify and cohere ,
try to tie up and conclude to a point .
and what was all
that stuff about native american not being able to see the ship
that columbus came in ?
who told the `` authority '' in this film
that that was what happened in 1492 ?
where they there too ?
had they compared this to scientific work
being done in visual cognition
( the famous gorilla video 
for example 
visit the visual cognition lab at the university of illinois site )
there may have been a more convincing point made .
here 
however 
it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo-jumbo.as a film :
this was not one film ,
it was two .
i found the documentary part mildly interesting ,
just to hear the person
talking about what they were talking about ( i was annoyed
that their credential were not presented at the bottom of the screen
when they spoke 
at least initially ! )
but i found the `` story '' part of the movie with matlin in it annoying 
disjointed 
intrusive 
non-related and downright stupid .
that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny .
it was laughable 
ludicrous 
sophomoric 
and stupid .
and i found the use of the word `` pollack '' offensive .
it just seemed so out of place and wrong .
is such usage okay
because a member of the group uses a pejorative term
to refer to the group
because he or she is a member of the group ?
that may be okay to make a point ,
but it did not seem to be used that way here .
and in any case 
i do not care what the reason ,
it offended me 
a pole .
i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as `` pollack . ''
and i certainly do not like like it
when other do .
can i watch or listen to a bigoted conversation
in which this term is used ?
you betcha !
but again this did not seem to be the case here .
it just seemed so out of place .
unprovocked 
unmitigated.the acting was abysmal .
elaine hendrix 's performance was totally unbelievable .
at time 
it seemed like she was just reading her line
that had just been given to her .
marlee matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing .
perhaps she was baffled by the material .
i know i was .
if she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged-up anxiety-prone malcontent ,
it just did not seem to click .
but by far 
the world 's worst was hendrix !
all in all 
i found this a disjointed ,
poorly acted piece of clap-trap .
