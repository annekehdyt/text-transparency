`` kalifornia '' is one of my all-time favourite movie ,
and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thriller of the 90`s .
the film has a very stylish surface to it ,
but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depiction of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence
they inflict upon other .
one of the film`s strongest aspect is it`s performance ,
brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho
named early .
pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly .
juliette lewis is equally as good
playing his naive girlfriend ,
her innocence is almost heart-eaking .
`` kalifornia '' has a very simple plot to it ,
that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour ,
but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder 
as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality .
there are alot of shocking scene ,
and it all mount to a power-house climax
that will haunt you for day .
`` kalifonia '' is a film
that should really be watched for it`s intense look
at how monstrous a human being can be 
and not only for it`s violence and gore .
