such a film of beauty
that it is hard to describe .
maybe it is the absence of superfluous dialogue ,
or maybe it is the absolutely stellar soundtrack ,
or maybe it is just meena mumari 's foot ,
but it is a joy to watch this movie again and again .
i have never seen another indian movie
that comes close to it ,
and few from any country rival its perfection .
