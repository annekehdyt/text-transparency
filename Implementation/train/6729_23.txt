as a another reviewer state hanna 's war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person ,
hanna `` anniko '' senesh ,
who would become the jewish joan of arc .
unfortunately i diverge in opinion not agreeing
that miss detmer as the lead is too beautiful
to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter .
in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty
but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic utality
as a resistor she faces .
maruschka detmer performance is ave 
poignant 
heartfelt or understood 
and totally believable .
in other word for me `` in the zone . ''
from the opening credit .
if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something
they believe
in and be impressively entertained give hanna 's war with maruschka detmer a try .
my hat is off also to ellen burstyn as hanna 's mother a much well known and famous actress
who could have made effort
to walk off with the film .
in that it is a team effort
perhaps of two actress ' but not an all about eve situation .
