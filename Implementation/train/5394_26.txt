this was a less than exciting short film i
saw between feature on turner classic movie recently .
while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor ,
the film itself just was not that moving and at time the plot looked pretty cheesy
-- like this was made for classroom use
and capturing the attention of a wider audience was not even a consideration .
in particular 
i really hated how many time in the film thing were reiterated
-- such as when the character
talked to her ,
they usually said
`` clara barton '' instead of `` ma'am '' 
`` miss barton '' or `` clara '' .
plus 
one sickly confederate soldier said
that he was a `` johnny reb 
a confederate a rebel 
... ''
-- almost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girl .
this was just sloppy writing
-- period.it was interesting to see john hamilton
( later 
`` perry white '' on the superman tv show )
in a beard as president garfield .
yep
-- it is him under that beard .
