the acting in this movie was superb ,
but mixed with the truth about the condition of many african in south africa made it heart wrenching .
it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from other run from their home 
so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeat ;
the conflict they shared
as they grew together and apart .
worth seeing
when you put the movie in it
is proper context .
