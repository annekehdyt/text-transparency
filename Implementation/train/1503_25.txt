i absolutely love all of tom robbin book ,
so i was very excited
and interested to see a movie made after one of his book .
i knew
that there would be no way
that the movie would capture even half of robbin ' magic ,
but after seeing the movie ,
it made me never want to read the book again .
the movie
even cowgirls get the blue does
not include an eighth of the content in the book ,
and it seems to focus more on the love connection between bonanza jellybean and sissy than anything else .
along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie ,
i think
that better actor definitely could have been chosen to play the character .
the only actor in the movie
that i thought
played their role fit to robbin ' description in the book
were julian 's friend 
in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie .
those
who have not read the book
might enjoy the movie ,
but as a huge tom robbin fan 
this movie was nothing but a disappointment .
