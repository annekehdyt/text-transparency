the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah 's own stand up ;
it is so over the top with prejudice
that you can not possibly take it to heart .
the fact is 
though ,
that
while most all person will `` get it 
''
it does not mean they will all appreciate it .
it is a very polarizing and one dimensional show ,
so
if you do not like it after 10 minute ,
you may as well give up there .
if you do like it after 10 minute 
stay tuned ,
because every episode thus far has been as good as the last.like all show 
though ,
it is not perfect .
personally i love the program ,
but there are some huge fault with it .
racist song are funny ,
but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize
-- a problem
that i had with `` jesus
is magic '' as well .
it seems
as if silverman gave herself a quota for song per episode
that does not need to exist .
not to mention
that
while the lyric to the song
she writes are good ,
the music 
well 
is not.another thing
to keep in mind
is that
while this show will for some reason appeal to fan of monty python 
upright citizen brigade 
etc. ,
it is nothing like those show .
i can watch monty python all day ,
but 
as much as i like this show 
i can not watch more than the half hour limit at a time .
it gets flat very fast .
the repeat value for this show is low too
-- the second time around an episode is fairly funny ,
and by the third time 
in my opinion 
it is boring.still ,
that first time around is very 
very funny .
give it a shot .
