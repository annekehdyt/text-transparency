i just saw this cartoon for the first time
and recognized the caricature of famous black entertainer ... cab calloway 
bessie smith ,
( not josephine baker or sophie tucker ,
who was white ) ,
thomas `` fat '' waller 
bill `` bojangle '' robinson 
stepin fetchit
( notwithstanding )
louis armstrong and the chorus girl are out of the famed `` cotton club '' in harlem .
true ... stereotype are there ,
but this was the way
it was ...
and these cartoon were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature .
harmann and ising cartoon tended to be more `` cutesy '' and more upscale ,
( after all ... we are talking about m-g-m )
than the standard animated short done over at warner 
paramount 
universal 
fox 
rko or lowly columbium .
even disney 's very early mickey mouse had load of barnyard humor
before uncle walt cleaned him up
just
before he went `` technicolor '' .disney had some cartoon with caricature of black entertainer as well ... for example 
1937 's silly symphony `` woodland cafe '' .
but we have to remember
that these film are part of a certain time and place .
50 year from now ... clip of the simpson 
family guy 
and south park will be also scrutinized 
analyzed ... and even vilified by future viewer .
