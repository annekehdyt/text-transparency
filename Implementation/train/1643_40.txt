i resisted seeing this movie
and i understand
why it was not a big hit in theatre .
`` october sky '' feel
and looks oh so familiar .
and it is .
all plot contrivance and emotion have been explored before in other film
-- and possibly even better .
but despite
it is familiarity and resistance to all formula hollywood ,
this movie is winning and likeable at every turn .
sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart 
mind and soul .
just as the character from steven sondheim 's musical merrily
we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof
hoping
it would launch their new generation
( `` what do you call it ?
you call it a miracle .
`` ) 
sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale .
while jaded townsfolk of their 1950 's coal town dismiss the event ,
homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.masterful direction
and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pal seem fresh and new .
especially affecting are subplots concerning homer 's ailing young school teacher .
remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship .
also remarkable is the father / son supblot
that anchors the film .
perfectly played all around .
even homer 's mom gets her moment
without cliche or intrusion .
her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heateaking .
`` myrtle beach '' says it all .
a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film
stating
that you will love this film
or they will refund your money .
for once 
i agree with them .
you will never look at the october sky quite the same again .
