`` stella '' ,
starring bette midler in the title role ,
is an unabashed tearjerker .
set in upstate new york ,
stella claire works night as a bar maid ,
pouring and dancing in a workingman 's saloon .
one night ,
in comes a slumming medical intern 
stephen dalla ,
who woos stella 
and in the course of their affair impregnates her .
she spurns both his offer of marriage and abortion ,
sends him packing to a lucrative medical career ,
and raises her daughter herself in near-poverty .
flash-forward 16 year and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous 
loving 
young lady .
dr. dalla is not out of the picture ,
still maintaining a tenuous 
but caring relationship with his daughter and ..i am rambling ,
and worse yet ,
making the movie sound somewhat interesting .
the acting and screenwriting are so over-the-top
you will let out a groan in almost every scene .
the chief offender is bette midler ,
but close behind is john goodman as her alcoholic buddy .
each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale ,
which is truly a hoot .
taken as a dramatic piece 
this film rate no more than grade d ,
but as camp ,
it scores an unintended b+ .
