the american humane association ,
which is the source of the familiar disclaimer `` no animal
were harmed ... ''
( the registered trademark of the aha ) ,
began to monitor the use of animal in film production more than 60 year ago ,
after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse jame
( 1939 ) .
needless to say ,
the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me .
i suppose one could say
that at least the horse did not die in vain ,
since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animal for the glory of movie making ,
but i can not help but feel
that
if the poor animal had a choice ,
this sure would not have been the path
he would have taken !
