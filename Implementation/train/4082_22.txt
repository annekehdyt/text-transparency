it is always a nice suprise
when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard .
this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller 
little richard
played by an actor
called leon
who i
have never seen
before but does an very good job .
as most tv film 
this is a little tamer than if made for cinema
which is a shame
because i am sure
there is lot
we could have seen about little richard
that was controversial .
instead we see a lot religous rubbish
which is the only thing
that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career .
all in all this film is good
and the acting is above average fot a tv film .
7/10 .
