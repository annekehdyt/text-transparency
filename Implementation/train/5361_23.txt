as i am no fan of almost any post- '' desperate
living ''
john water films ,
i warmed to `` pecker '' .
after he emerged from the underground ,
water produced trash-lite version of his earlier work
( `` cry baby '' 
`` polyester '' 
hairspray '' )
that to die-hard fan looked and tasted like watered down liqueur .
`` pecker '' ,
which does not attempt to regurgitate early success ,
is a slight 
quiet 
humble commentary on the vagary of celeity and the pretentiousness of the art world .
water clearly knows this subject well
because he has also exhibited and sold
( at ridiculous price )
some of the most amateurish pop art ever created
that you could not imagine anyone being able to give away
if it was not emblazoned with the water `` name '' .
edward furlong is fine as `` pecker ''
and water ' non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject .
