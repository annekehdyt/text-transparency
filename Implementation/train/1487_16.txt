i am sorry
but this is just plain pathetic .
the little girl was a at ,
their were no enjoyable character and the plot sucked .
besides it was not even a gator
as the film would like us to believe .
if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you
will find
that it really is a crocodile 
not a gator .
obviously they did not hire a real animal expert
or they would know
that the creature is a croc .
it is a sad excuse for a movie .
especially the ending .
i nearly fell asleep with this one .
