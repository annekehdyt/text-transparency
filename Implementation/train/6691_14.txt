in watching this early demille work 
it was once again reinforced to me
that early demille is far superior to late demille .
his attention to use of light within scene
is remarkable .
his pacing is very good ,
enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so .
it is a pity
that he was not as intuitive about the style of his later sound film
as he seemed to be in his silent film.this
was the first film
in which i had seen cleo ridgely .
she was remarkable 
quite restrained and yet conveyed a oad spectrum of emotions.the ending is wonderful .
