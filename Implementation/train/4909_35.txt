i should have trusted my instinct better :
no expectation - no disappointment .
instead 
however 
i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi
( 1983 )
and was utally disappointed .
powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor 
and - artistically -
it fails miserably .
it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi ,
hurriedly threw it together ,
placed everything in slow motion
and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass
to hurriedly throw together some banal background music ,
which is incessantly repeated .
where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion change ,
powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane image in slow-motion
( if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode ,
you will see what i mean ) .
what disappointed me the most 
however 
was philip glass 's soundtrack .
i could not -
and still can not - believe
that these commercial-sounding new age type drone ,
which could easily
have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a casio calculator ,
were from the same composer
who so illiantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi .
all in all 
a big waste of time !
my advice :
forget commercialism !
watch koyaanisqatsi again instead !
