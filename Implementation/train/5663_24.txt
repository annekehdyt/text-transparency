michael bennett and nicholas dante 's broadway show ran for year ,
but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation ,
which most likely stems from the choice of director
( richard attenborough 
as far from b-way
as you could get )
and lead actor
( michael dougla ,
who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer ) .
the slim story 
about a grueling audition for a broadway show
which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singer ,
is pushed right up on us 
with loud 
assy talent
playing to the rafter .
nothing is modulated or subtle 
particularly a laughable subplot about a ex-dancer returning to the theater and butting head with old-flame dougla .
the over-eager hopeful are filled with promise and heartache ,
but their personal story of angst are a little embarrassing ; this ,
matched with attenborough 's sluggish pacing 
spell disaster ,
and even the now-famous song fail to eak through the artificial wrapping .
*1/2 from ****
