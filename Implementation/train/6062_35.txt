there is so many negative review about `` stay away 
joe '' in here i just can not stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen .
here is a side you
have not heard yet.elvis presley 's movie are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason :
they are perfect film for a pure relaxation
because i do not have to think
when i watch them .
that means i do not have to worry about missing a complex plot
because there never is a proper plot
to start with .
i can just kick off my shoe 
grab a beer 
sit back 
switch off my ain
and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy-going rock n ' roll tune from the grooviest decade of them all.in my book `` stay away 
joe ''
definitely falls into the `` so bad
it is good '' -category .
now if you are like me and appreciate `` the trash value '' ,
this is the ultimate 1960 's camp experience .
it is so bad
that it is almost surrealistic to watch
and just when you think
that it can not possibly get any worse
it surprises you in the most imaginable way .
in the end you are so amazed by all the new level of stupidity
you just do not know whether to laugh or cry .
in a nutshell :
i love it
because it is so damn amusing
that there once was a generation
that actually made film like this .
i still give it 1/10 though -
once it hits the bottom 100
it will became an instant bad movie classic .
