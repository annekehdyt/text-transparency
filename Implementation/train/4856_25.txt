this is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste ,
and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film .
the movie is about a couple trying for a child ,
and those person in real life
who are in that situation will wince at the depiction
that are portrayed .
for instance scene at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny
and are quite frankly embarrassing .
the male lead
who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from village person .
the female lead is trying to look 20 year younger
than she is .
both leads come across as unappealing 
unattractive and completely unconvincing .
there are various ridiculous
and totally unassuming gratuitous scene in the film 
for example with a budget airline ,
which is devoid of any humor .
the only reason
i give this 3/10 instead of 1/10
is one mark for shirley maclaine ,
who is a a class above anything else in the pic ,
and one mark for some half decent
( albeit old )
music .
