i saw this movie by luck ,
just because i was going through a phase
where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman
and wanted to see all of his recent movie and thank god i did !
this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorite !
the story revolves around two girl
who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country
where they will learn the true meaning of freedom.alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together
before going to college
but their trip ended up a much more complicated story .
the struggle
they go through
as they
are arrested in thailand
and became prisoner is very moving and intense .
the acting is amazing ,
the image extraordinary 
the soundtrack is fantastic
and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful .
i actually can not even find the right word
to describe
how this movie makes me feel
every time i watch it .
i know
some person have not appreciated as much as me by the rating
the movie has but i swear 
this one ,
you have to see ! ! !
i promise it will stick with you !
