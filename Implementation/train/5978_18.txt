i do not think
i need to tell you the story .
for it has been told for year and year .
so i will just share my feeling .
i first saw cinderella was
when i was five year old .
from then on i was a disney child in a good way .
the animation now seems childish and old fashioned ,
but that is part of its charm now .
now 
in the age of high school musical and computer generated image 
it seems like person have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movie .
thankfully i was born
before that so i was introduced to this classic .
and it seems no matter how old i get 
i turn back into
that five year old watching it on vhs .
which is the true magic of disney .
