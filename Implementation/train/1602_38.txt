this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light
but it is telling a story based on true event .
unfortunately not everything in life ,
including religion ,
are all nice and rosy .
sometimes person and group do thing
that at the time seem like the right thing
but in retrospective do not look as great
as they once did .
`` a love divided '' tells the story of a family ,
yes it does incorporate religion ,
but really the story is about a family ,
and that family 's ability
to stay together no matter
what is thrown at them .
this film is also based on true event
which is not to say that this story 
scene by scene 
is true ,
but if you were to look at news article from that time period you would be able to see
that neither church handled the incident in a way
that was helpful towards the family .
both church are at fault here 
the catholic church
for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place
and not responding to the violence
that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother
that she should just obey her husband and his priest
and not put up a fight .
in this case both let this family down .
i believe
that the film does a good job
in showing this struggle in both the church and the family .
it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church ,
just the opposite ,
it shows
how one incident can change the course of that religion 's idea and how one person can have an effect far more reaching
then just themselves .
