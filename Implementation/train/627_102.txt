as with most of the reviewer 
i saw this on starz !
ondemand .
after watching the preview with my girlfriend ,
she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched .
i 
on the other hand 
thought
it looked weird enough
to warrant a watching .
i mean 
the design of dr. meso alone warranted at least a ief sweep over this title .
after watching it ,
i can say
that
while there are some interesting aspect
to it
( namely the owsing over the notebook
and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story ) ,
it is best to pass over this one .
*major spoiler ahead*
after making their first video for their as-yet-unfinished cd 
the lead singer 
cassidy 
kills herelf in an attempt
to get her boyfriend neil to notice her .
3 month later 
the band is trying to decide
if they are going to finish the album or not .
to try and see what cassidy would have wanted ,
they go to see an old psychic friend of her 
dr. meso ,
and try to contact her through him .
in his card reading 
dr. meso turns up four straight death card for the four remaining band member .
bad time are ahead .
( i just wanted to make a point that later in the film ,
they do explain
that the death card really just represents change .
kudos to them on that at least . )
even without the approval of their deceased friend ,
they decide to go ahead and finish the album .
but while in the bathroom 
cassidy 's best-friend 
dora 
catches a glimpse of her deceased friend .
when another band-mate goes in to check on her ,
dora is standing in the dark ,
requesting his sunglass .
that is when the killing begins.my main problem with the film from the very get-go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault .
too many warping effect 
unnecessary zoom ,
and a plethora of other cheap effect riddle this film .
an incoherent storyline does not help anything either .
while the narrative hang together for the first part ,
once cassidy is resurrected ,
everything fall apart .
we have jump-cut between cassidy and dr. meso
( who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building ) ,
which show
they are connected in some way or another .
however 
within a few minute of that revelation 
we find
that cassidy really is an independent being from meso .
she then turns on the guy
who had been helping her revenge
and he scurries away in a way
that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker .
but not in a good way.from this point on ,
the whereabout of cassidy are shown ,
but there are strange lapse
as character move from place to place almost out of sequence .
one scene
we see cassidy
standing at a desk ,
when a character enter in the next 
she is nowhere to be found .
as he move behind the desk ,
we see her at the end of a hallway .
then in another room grabbing the keys
( which neil already has ) ,
then back again .
not to mention that from one moment to the next 
cassidy 's mood seems to go a complete 180
without a catalyst to it .
one moment 
she wants to kill everyone
( although she is only wounded 90 % of the character )
- the next
she is apologizing to everyone
and walks out the door to die again .
sound confusing ?
that is because it is .
it is a jumbled mess
that i am sure
the writer could not even figure out.as for the performance ,
most are particularly wooden .
some though are interesting ,
but overall this is not a piece
that would be known for it is acting .
the story is the driving force behind this piece .
