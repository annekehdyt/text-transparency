i love this movie ! ! !
purple rain came out the year i was born
and it has had my heart
since i can remember .
prince is so tight in this movie .
i went to a special showing of purple rain last night
and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fan cause
this movie is so undervalued ,
it is really one of the greatest movie of all time .
the music is untouchable .
the movie is about `` the kid '' ,
played by prince ,
his family is dysfunctional ,
his band is the hottest act in town ,
and he has his eye on the apollonia 
an aspiring singer .
there is no question
why purple is my favorite color i can thank `` the kid '' for that .
so if you have not seen this
then
you are need to asap .
this is a classic - 4ever !
