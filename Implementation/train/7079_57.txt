i am a big fan of stephen king 's work ,
and this film has made me an even greater fan of king .
pet sematary is about the creed family .
they have just moved into a new house ,
and they seem happy .
but there is a pet cemetery behind their house .
the creed 's new neighbor jud
( played by fred gwyne )
explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery .
that burial ground is pure evil .
jud tell louis creed
that
when you bury a human
being ( or any kind of pet )
up in the burial ground ,
they would come back to life .
the only problem 
is that
when they come back ,
they are not the same person ,
they are evil .
soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary ,
everything start to go to hell .
i wont explain anymore
because i do not want to give away some of the main part in the film .
the acting
that pet sematary had was pretty good ,
but needed a little bit of work .
the story was one of the main part of this movie ,
mainly because it was so original and gripping .
this film features lot of make-up effect
that make the movie way more eerie 
and frightening .
one of the most basic reason
why this movie sent chill up my back ,
was in fact the make-up effect .
there is one character in this film
that is truly freaky .
that character is `` zelda . ''
this particular character pops up in the film about three time
to be precise .
zelda is rachel creed 's sister
who passed away year before ,
but rachel is still haunted by her .
the first time zelda appears in the movie is not generally scary
because she is not talking or anything ,
but the second time is the worst ,
and to be honest ,
the second time scare the living **** out of me .
there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie ,
it is almost perfect .
pet sematary deliver great scare 
some pretty good acting 
first rate plot 
and mesmerizing make-up .
this is truly one of most favorite horror film of all time .
10/10 .
