i was not expecting this to be a great movie ,
but neither was i expecting it to be so awful .
i hated the mother character
so much i had to turn the channel .
i turned it back ,
hoping it was just one part of the movie 
but no .
and for the daughter
to sit there
take being embarrassed ,
or almost done out of a job ,
or driven to madness inside her own home ?
are you kidding me ?
i was raised to respect
( and even fear )
my mother but i would put her up fast in the nearest hotel
if she proved that annoying in my house .
i was expected to follow a set of rule in my mother 's house ,
after all.i did not buy any of it .
i tried giving it several chance ,
i really did .
sorry .
