i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed .
i generally like to see documentary ,
but i can not remember to have seen one
that is better than 'earth ' .
i knew some of the scene from youtube videos
that i found by random owsing .
i also remember to have seen part of the film on multimedia store ,
running on the displayed high definition tv .
after seeing the movie
it is obvious to me
why the footage is so popular among youtube user and multimedia retail manager :
it is just so awesome and spectacular
that you can not help but stare on the screen ,
no matter
if you are generally interested in nature documentary or not.without hesitating a 10/10 .
for sure 
there are more thrilling movie ,
but in regard of documentary 
'earth ' is definitely one of the best
of it is genre .
