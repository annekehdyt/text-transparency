performing himself.it
is magic what he does with the piano.edgar kennedy plays chief of police station.sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse.there is a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.just look at kelly and sinatra performing
`` we hate
to leave ''
.it is so energetic .
`` if you knew susie
( like i know susie ) ''
is quite funny.it is a nice moment
when frank sing brahms ' lullaby to little dean stockwell.it is lovely to listen to grayson
singing the tango `` jealousy ''
.the most memorable sequence is the one
that takes into the animated fantasy world ,
and there gene sing and dance with jerry mouse.also tom cat is seen there
as the butler.they originally asked mickey mouse
but he refused.the movie was nominated for five oscar
but georgie stoll got one for original music score.anchor aweigh is some high class entertainment .
