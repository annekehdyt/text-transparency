i used to love saina the teenage witch
and have seen every single episode .
i remember
when i used to sit at 6pm every night
and wait for it to come on nickelodeon ,
however
when saina left high school the show began to go downhill .
the best series has to be
when she was friend with valerie
( i am not sure
which one that is ) .
from there the next series
( friend with dreama )
was still really good ,
but when she left high school it just did not seem right .
all the main character seemed to have left ,
which meant
that it did not have as much of the old `` sparkle '' ,
however the first series where saina is in college
is still relatively good and watchable ,
however
when her aunt 's leave and saina move into their house
it just is not right .
she is no longer a teenager ,
so therefore the name of the show is not right
and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just does not seem right ,
especially when saina nearly marry someone
that is not harvey .
thank goodness he came through in the last five minute of the last episode
to take her away .
all in all i still love to watch the old episode of saina the teenage witch ,
but i think
the writer took it too far
and should have left it with saina leaving high school .
because after that the show definitely lost some of it is magic
