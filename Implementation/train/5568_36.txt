a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott .
g.i .
jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seal .
the training is the most difficult and hard in existence
as the instructor says in the film to the lead character o'neil
played by demi moore .
there is no particular message or point in this film
or then i could not reach it properly .
it may be a some kind of a statement of female right and ability
but it all sink under the tired scene
and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.i really can not understand
why ridley uses so much zoom
in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert ? !
it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish
so i would really like to know
what the director saw in that technique .
when i look at his latest film 
black hawk dawn ,
there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scene
( which are plenty )
and they are very intense and directed with skill .
the whole finale in g.i .
jane looks ugly
and is nothing more but stupid and ainless shooting
and killing.this is ridley scott 's worst movie in my opinion
and there are no significan not touch from which this great director is known .
still i am glad i saw this in widescreen format
because there are still couple of great scene and sample of scott 's ability ,
but they are very few in this film.a disappointment and nothing
compared to the classic
( blade runner 
thelma and louise 
alien and so on.. )
of this talented director .
so i am forced to give g.i .
jane 4/10 .
