this film was recommended to me by a friend
who lives in california .
she thought
it was wonderful
because it was so real ,
`` just the way person in the ohio valley are ! ''
i am from the area
and i experienced the film as `` just the way person in california think
we are ! ''
i have lived in marietta and parkersburg
and worked minimum wage job there .
we laughed a lot ,
we bonded with and took eak with person our own age ;
the young person went out together at night .
the older person had little free time after work
because they were taking care of their family .
the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.aside from the `` if
you live in a manufactured home
you must be depressed '' condescension ,
the story lacked any element of charm ,
mystery or even a sense of dread.martha 's character was the worst drawn .
it is doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church ,
but if she had ,
she probably would have made friend there .
i have read review
that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose
because rose was `` younger 
prettier and thinner ''
but if this is the case
it is not shown .
all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reason
that would apply just as much
if the three friend had been the same age and gender .
we see martha feeling left out during smoking session ,
left out of the loop
when social plan are made ,
used but not appreciated ,
and finally disrespected and hurt.just one more thing :
are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder
because he had once had a few panic attack ?
please .
this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .
