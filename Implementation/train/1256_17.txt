this movie lacked ... everything :
story 
acting 
surprise 
ingenuity and a soul .
fifteen minute in 
i was staring at the screen saying ,
`` how could all of these guy get together
and consider themselves friend
( even without the girl ) ? ''
another fifteen minute in 
i was praying for as much amanda peet as possible .
when a bad movie quietly rears
it is ugly head ,
eye candy is a nice consolation .
but there was not much of that !
cheated on all front !
