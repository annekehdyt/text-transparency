i love this film .
it is well written and acted
and has good cinematography .
the story blends action 
humor 
mysticism 
and tenderness with great set and beautiful location shot .
see it ,
buy it ,
show it to your friends.the acting is good
and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero .
i enjoyed all the character
and found them to be interesting
and well developed with dynamic interactions.i cared what happened to these person and ,
while the outcome was pretty predictable
( the good guy win ,
the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves life
-- who does not see that coming ?
) 
it still made me happy
when everything worked out well in the end .
thank god this film 's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel .
grab some popcorn 
cuddle up on the couch 
and watch this fun 
happy and entertaining film .
