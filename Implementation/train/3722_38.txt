after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer
( 1976 )
to be the final chapter in the series .
dirty harry is back 
older 
more dirtier and grittier than ever
since the original 1971 classic.dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer 
vigilante cop 
and vietnam veteran terrorist .
but now he is after a new killer 
a killer
who wants payback ,
by gunning down her attacker.sudden impact ings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry .
callahan is on a new murder case
that is circling back to a woman
( played by sondra locke ) ,
who was utally raped ,
along with her sister ,
who is left traumitized .
ten year after 
she is out for revenge by gunning down her attacker .
at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superior
after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack ,
of which the mob are hunting him as well .
so in order to let the heat die down within the city ,
harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town ,
but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well ,
while hunting her attacker one by one .
harry is on the investigation
and finds the killing very similar ,
as he home in on the killer 's trails.sudden impact in my opinion ,
has to be one of my top 10 revenge film ,
as well
as being the second best dirty harry movie yet ,
far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined .
sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had 
a dark tone with entertaining value.so do you feel lucky 
punk ?
