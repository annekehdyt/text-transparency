wow .
this was probably the worst dcom ever .
i watched the first half hour and i laughed .
brenda song plays wendy 
the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friend
who is determined to be homecoming queen .
she is supposed to save the world as a warrior ,
and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial art .
shin teaches her the skill of a snake 
tiger 
etc .
and she has to learn certain technique
to save the world.this movie
is great for kid
who want to learn about martial art and the chinese culture
but the acting and casting was horrible.brenda song is a comedic actress
and i can not see her playing a serious role .
it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin .
shin could not act at all ,
and everything was totally unbelievable.i watched this movie
and tried to think of something similar ,
and the thing i came up with was the power ranger .
this movie is so fake
and the stunt were so power ranger-esquire
that it was just corny and stupid .
the character were not likable and i just could not stand to watch it .
disney really needs to take time
to make some decent movie .
high school musical is the only movie
that deserves to be on disney channel ,
along with other movie
like jumping ship 
color of friendhip ,
go figure 
read it and weep ,
and stuck in the suburbs.if you like action-adventure and corny joke ,
you will like this movie .
