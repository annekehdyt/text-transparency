this is the first review i have wrote for imdb so bare with me ,
but i caught this flick on hbo
and was sure
glad i watched it .
richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective
who bends the rule
to get the job done .
i think
the story is great ,
and there is never a dull scene
that slows the pace of the movie down .
some part of the movie
which have to do with demented sex addict
are pretty shocking ,
but
if you have ever seen a crime film like se7en ,
you will be able to stomach the scene just fine .
so all in all ,
if you are looking for a good detective/suspense movie ,
ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it .
