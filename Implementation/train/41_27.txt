`` pandemonium '' is a horror movie spoof
that comes off more stupid than funny .
believe me
when i tell you ,
i love comedy .
especially comedy spoof .
`` airplane '' 
`` the naked gun '' trilogy 
`` blazing saddle '' 
`` high anxiety '' 
and `` spaceball '' are some of my favorite comedy
that spoof a particular genre .
`` pandemonium '' is not up there with those film .
most of the scene in this movie had me sitting
there in stunned silence
because the movie was not all that funny .
there are a few laugh in the film ,
but
when you watch a comedy ,
you expect to laugh a lot more than a few time
and that is all this film has going for it .
geez 
`` scream '' had more laugh than this film
and that was more of a horror film .
how bizarre is that ?
