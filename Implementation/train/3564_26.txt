extremely interesting and intriguing movie .
the similarity to david lynch
( who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtain in the film )
and the novel of franz kafka
( the house keeper in this film
is called mrs. grubach ,
as is the one in der prozess ... )
are clearly present
but in this case are accompanied by clear reference to the colonial past of belgium in africa .
the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe :
this colonialism is an important part ,
as is the inability to cope with such a past ,
but the personal memory of the main character are a central issue as well 
and his quest for social contact and love .
these are the symbolic theme i deduced from the movie ,
but in fact they are no more than impressions.but
even if you just try to follow the linear story
without these symbolic background ,
you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery
( beautiful close up of beatle ,
larvas and other nasty insect are alternated with great dream sequence
and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style ) .
maybe you can say
that i did not quite 'get ' the film ,
but i have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour ,
deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity .
