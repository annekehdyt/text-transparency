yes ,
that is right ,
it is .
i firmly believe
that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made .
it was amazing the first time i saw it 
with its huge environment and colorful character 
and its amazing now .
the play control is perfect ,
the graphic are beautiful ,
and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there .
a must have for any n64 owner ,
and a reason
to get an n64 for everyone else .
