while this movie is not a classic by any stretch ,
it is very entertaining
as i remember it .
i saw it about 15 year ago on hbo
and loved the movie .
it was written by the same guy
that wrote and directed `` arthur ''
and though it is not as funny as that movie ,
it does show the potential
that steve gordon reached with `` arthur '' .
