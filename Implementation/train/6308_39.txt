i have to congratulate the genius
who approved this one .
edward furlong 
you are not as good
as you think mate ,
you can not grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap ,
which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.the filming is bad ,
and i mean bad .
anyone with a camera would get the same result 
or better.the acting ,
lets just say :
do not go to the supermarket
looking for actor .
the good one usually come with a degree or 
at least 
have some damn experience !
the director.. mr. jon keeyes 
please find your purpose in life ,
as a director you simply suck .
your directing is poor ,
the angle are all messed up
( not in a good way ) ,
the line seem
as if they are being read out of toilet paper ,
and the damn music.. it always comes up
when it should not and goes out for no apparent reason .
and do not go for writer either 
by the way .
making movie is not like serving on a coffeshop ,
it requires art and skill ,
thing i really doubt
you will ever have.instead of making a badass shootout movie ,
you should have shot this one back to oblivion
and wait 'till something good came up..
or just go find a job on a coffeshop .
you will have less stress
and you will save movie goer some money and a bad night.vote :
1/10
( my first one )
