slaughter high is about a boy
named marty .
he was harassed ,
and picked on in high school .
a group of kid played several prank on him ,
and these prank were really bad .
the last prank ended tragically.cue to 5 year later .
the gang of kid meet up again for a reunion .
one of them set it up at the old high school .
the school is now abandoned ,
and they have to eak in .
for some reason 
the janitor is still there ,
but he tells them to go ahead
and have fun
because they give him a beer.they start partying ,
and looking at their old locker ,
and they see something of marty 's .
one girl feel sorry for marty
but another guy calms her down.once the kill begin ,
it is great .
every kill is creative and gory .
we see a figure in a jester mask ,
hunting them one by one throughout the school .
it appears marty is back to exact revenge .
after the first person is killed ,
they find out
they are locked in the school .
they begin looking for a way out.now ,
there are a number of illogical thing in this movie .
first of all 
i do not know anyone
who has a 5 year reunion .
second of all 
after the first kid dy 
a girl gets blood all over her .
they all run away in a panic ,
yet she runs to the bathroom ,
and finds a bathtub .
hrr friend has just been killed ,
and she decides to take a bath ! ?
more importantly 
why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom .
anyway 
the bathtub does not seem to really work ... .and
she dy a horrible death this is an 80s movie .
it is a horror slasher .
who cares
if it has some illogical part .
i for one do not .
this movie has really great death .
the ending ... . there is a twist .
having recently seen haute tension ,
i can compare the two .
the only way
they are similar is that there is a twist ,
which kind of left me disappointed ... ..then right after the twist ,
comes a great ,
if not the best kill ,
in the movie.after the last kill 
the killer looks at the screen
and also does something crazy ,
and it was the perfect way
to end the movie .
it has me going `` wow ... ''
