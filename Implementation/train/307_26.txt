isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor .
the director of `` la pianiste '' understands this ,
providing the viewer with long takes of huppert 's face ,
and these are a pleasure to see .
huppert is not an animated actor
-- she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyeow or flicker of a smile.other than the enjoyment
of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession ,
there is nothing in this movie
that makes me want to recommend it .
( well ,
if you enjoy self-mutilation 
sado-masochism ,
and bizarre behavior 
`` la pianiste '' might work for you .
other than these attribute 
i could not find any redeeming value in it .
)
buried in all this strange material
there is a kernel of truth .
person
who compete at the very highest level
-- musically 
athletically 
whatever --
begin as strange person ,
and are shaped into stranger person by the competitive environment.not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson .
