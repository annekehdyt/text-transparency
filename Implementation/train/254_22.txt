his first movie after longtime friend john belushi 's death 
aykroyd show much fatigue
trying to pull off a character
that would have been a snap for belushi.instead ,
`` doctor detroit '' gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird 
violent pimp to ward off a rival
known only as mom .
that is bad enough ,
but he also has class to teach 
a school dinner to host 
four lady of the evening to protect and a pimp 's dinner
( or something like that )
to attend .
no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time .
why should the viewer be alone ?
it was on this film
that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon .
at least some good came out of this chaotic mess.one and a half star .
you want good aykroyd ,
see `` the blue brother '' .
you want bad 
see `` doctor detroit '' .
