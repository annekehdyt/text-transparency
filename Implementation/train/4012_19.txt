this movie is based on the art of frank frazetta 
the mythical fantasy illustrator .
some of the character are straight out of his painting
( the death dealer being the best example ) .
surprisingly 
the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art .
bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope
( the technique of tracing a live action sequence )
and this film is no exception .
however 
since the subject of the movie is quite realistic
( all character are human ) ,
this works pretty well.but what i really like here is the plot :
for once we have a story with interesting character and nice action sequence ,
a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe .
this movie has the feeling of the best conan comic ,
not surprisingly since roy thomas is the writer of the marvel series of our favourite cimmerian !
this is a far cry from the crappy live action conan 
not to speak of all the b-movie of the genre.definitely recommended !
