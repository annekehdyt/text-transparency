i enjoy watching person doing eakdance ,
especially if they do it as well as in the best scene of this movie
which takes you to a disco club
called `` roxy '' .
especially at christmas time ,
because there also appears a `` mc santa claus '' .even
if this is an old film ,
and
even if i have videotaped it from tv ,
when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen ,
i went there to check it out .
it is much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv.even
if many person here think
that
watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost ,
i disagree with this and i think
that
when i paid my ticket ,
i got the money 's worth by seeing this ,
as it is on big screen ,
especially seated on front row of the cinema 
an unforgettable experience 
and much better than just on video .
