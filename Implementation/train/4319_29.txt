`` do not bother to watch this film ''
would be better advice ,
if you like marilyn monroe in her other role .
this was a huge disappointment
considering the great cast ,
not just marilyn.the story was just nothing ,
certainly nothing like described on the vhs box 
of course .
there simply was no suspense 
precious little excitement and too many dull spot 
most of them
trying to show why `` nellie ''
( monroe )
was so messed up .
this was not a good role for monroe ,
even though i did not need to see this character
to know
she could act .
`` some like it hot '' alone was good enough evidence for me .
but this role just did not fit her
and it is no surprise
it was not one of her more popular films.it is also too bad a film had the waste of the talent of actor like richard widmark 
anne bancroft 
elisha cook jr. 
jeanne cagney 
donna cocoran and other .
summary :
it is not entertaining
and entertainment is the name of the game .
