a highly atmospheric cheapie ,
showing great ingenuity in the use of prop 
set and effect
( fog 
lighting 
focus )
to create an eerie and moody texture .
the story is farfetched ,
the acting is merely functional ,
but it shows how imaginative effect can develop an entire visual narrative .
this movie is recommended for its mood and texture 
not for its story .
