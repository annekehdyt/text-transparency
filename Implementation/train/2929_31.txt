silly 
often ridiculous romp
involving the landing of a space ship
and the resulting havoc this causes on tim
( jeff daniel )
and the person in his orbit.am always amazed by daniel .
he showed such depth
and promise in 1983 's `` term of endearment '' as shirley maclaine 's philandering son-in-law .
as the year have passed ,
daniel has been unable to get his hand on a good 
meaty role .
instead 
he is in inane comedy such as `` dumb and dumber .
`` as for this picture ,
it fails because of the subject matter .
at least 
the television show ought about a variety of situation .
in the film 
we have constant slapstick
and person
turning into monster
as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-martin.the part of mrs. brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film .
on television 
pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situation with the martian leaving her perplexed .
in the film version 
a blond bomb-shell as brown 
tries romantic entanglement.television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent ,
or is he really that ?
a very big disappointment for those
who enjoyed the television
show so much .
