i thought
i had seen this movie 
twice in fact .
then i read all the other review ,
and they did not quite match up .
a man and three young student 
two girl and a boy 
go to this town
to study alleged bigfoot sighting .
i still feel pretty confident
that this is the movie i saw ,
despite the discrepancy in the review .
therefore i am putting my review back :
if you like the occasional 'b ' movie ,
as i do ,
then return to boggy creek
is the movie for you !
whether it is setting the sleep timer ,
and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb 
or just hanging out with friend .
boggy creek 
the mute button 
and you have got a fun night of improv .
look out !
is the legend true ?
i think
we just might find out 
along with a not-so-stellar cast .
will there be any equipment malfunction at particularly key moment in the film ?
does our blonde 
manly 
young hero have any chest hair ?
will the exceptionally high-tech technicolor last the entire film ?
you will have to watch to find out for yourself .
