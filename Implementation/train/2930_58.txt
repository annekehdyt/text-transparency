first 
nobody can understand
why this movie is rated so poorly .
not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me
who am pretty hard-boiled with a decade long experience of horror
starting with driving through dark ride
( ghost train )
as a child .
second 
the main actress cheri christian has a face
that lets you hope
she will be the leading actress in major picture of the future .
third 
this woman is that tremendously beautiful
that i suggest the director retire all those cameron diazes 
eva mendezes ,
and how ever the name of these ephemeral bulb-light are .
mrs. christian is not a light ,
but a sun.however 
`` dark remain '' is also of considerable metaphysical importance .
they idea
that photographs shows creature of the intermediary reign between reality and `` imagination ''
that are not visible with one ' own eye
is not new .
but i have never seen in a movie
before that those creature are visible on the photographs only for certain person and only to certain time .
this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality
( by which reality turns into a sign ) ,
but becomes an alternative form of reality
which can change as the `` real '' reality can .
being a sign ,
the changing of the picture means
that it influences the photographed object 
i.e .
the sign behaves like an object .
now 
in our usual world of perception 
it is common that object change sign .
f.ex. ,
if someone grows a bird ,
his photograph will show him with beard ,
not without ,
as it did before .
but the opposite 
the changing of object by sign would imply
that the photo with beard is first
and only then the beard grows on the man .
this is ,
very simply expressed ,
the case
that happen with the photo
taken by the main character in the prison 
in this movie .
this is new ,
and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movie
which usually just repeat and reorder effect and feature
that are already well-known 
mostly since the silent time .
