i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf .
and before i got my first vcr i figured i would christen it with this little gem
and it is bad film-making at it is finest !
the dialog is inadvertently hilarious .
and it contains a cameo with donald trump .
anthony quinn is in it inexplicably .
and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later year .
this movie is mr. quinn 's country bears.it features line like ,
`` shut up
and let me fight ! ! !
`` and `` you are saying a lot of sh_it ! ''
and the priceless comeback :
`` unfortunately it is sh_it 
tough angry sh_it !
`` you will be awed by a fight scene
as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table !
and does a nice kung fu kick
when she comes up from the roll !
chop socky action and t and a thrill ! !
! what schlock movie fan could ask for more ?
oh ,
and when mr. quinn 's character commit suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost
she asks him why
he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness ?
he says ,
`` real man do not eat quiche .
`` uh 
aaa 
yeah .
if bo was a smart cookie
she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there !
