this is not my favorite wip
( `` woman in prison '' ) ,
but it is one of the most famous film in the sub-genre .
it is was produced by roger corman ,
who at this point had already produced a few wip .
it is obvious that the film try to play with the established formula .
the movie takes place in an usa prison ,
not in a `` banana republic '' like most wip film .
i am not sure
if that was a wise move ,
but it is an acceptable change of pace .
writer-director demme really gets into his job 
alway digging for new way
to present a familiar scenario .
in fact 
he is a little too ambitious for his own good .
the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequence
that are borderline pretentious
but it is fun to see how hard he try to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick .
but do not worry ,
demme still operates within the parameter of the sub-genre .
there is plenty of nudity and violence ,
something
that will satisfy hardcore fan .
the film is a little slow ,
but it is very entertaining .
the cast is good .
roberta collin is a wip veteran ,
so she does not need an introduction ,
and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden .
pam grier is sorely missed 
though .
