at what point exactly does a good movie go bad ?
when does a movie go from `` watchable ''
to `` where is that and^ @ _+ # !
* off switch '' ?
thank goodness for dvds 
like this one 
that can be borrowed from the liary - for free !
likewise 
thank goodness for the `` fast forward '' switch on the dvd player .
i feel sorry for those person
who were duped at the box office.at one point
( i have forgotten exactly
when because now it is all just a blur ) ,
our `` hero 
'' luke wilson start running through traffic ;
i think
he was looking for a cab .
it was at that point
when i gave up ,
realizing i could not care
whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.the last time
the movie was interesting was
when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster 
hair dryer in hand 
and first meet the `` heroine 
'' uma thurman .
that scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far 
far above the departing luke and uma .
that was the last time
the movie was funny ,
and when was that scene ?
ten minute into the flick ? every time the movie tried to become `` funny 
''
it could not .
every time
the movie approached `` excitement 
''
it fizzled out 
heading in the opposite direction .
when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard ,
the sound track stayed empty
and silent.the sex scene were not needed
and were beyond lame ;
the damage to set and prop unnecessary and childish .
when uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend ,
i felt like i was watching `` the 40 year old virgin meet pulp fiction '' ;
that is when i realized
that there was no turning back
because i thoroughly disliked `` the 40 year old virgin '' and `` pulp fiction .
`` luke wilson 's sidekick 
rainn wilson
( also seen in the dreary `` the last mimzy '' )
adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie .
rainn wilson 
the king of television boredom 
should stay with that equally awful medium .
hey 
rainn wilson !
leave full-length motion pictures alone !
every time uma 's rival 
anna faris 
came on screen ,
i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster
to jump out from behind the scenery ;
once you see anna faris in `` scary movie 
''
that is all you ever see ,
no matter the movie ,
no matter the medium .
the character
played by wanda syke
was just plain awful
and was so out of place in this flick .
