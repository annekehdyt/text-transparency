when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie ;
it is touch and go
whether you should revisit it .
anyway 
i remembered a scary scene
involving a homeless person and a cool villain
played by jeff kober .
`` the first power '' is not a very good movie ,
sad to say .
it is chock full of those cop clich\u00e9s and a very poor script with hole a truck could drive through
( along with countless convenient `` twist ''
that help the story run along ) .
lou diamond phillip is the over-confident bad ass cop
who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber
only to find out
he was a minion of satan himself
and now has the power of resurrection along with the power
of possessing every weak minded person
who he comes across .
through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic
who helps with the case.ahhh ,
this is trash .
but enjoyable as such 
especially if you have fond memory of it .
it scared me as a kid
and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good .
as for any kind of logic here ;
forget it ,
just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure
and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70 's demonic flick .
and who on earth thought
it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillip in the lead here ?
needless to say
he is not convincing at all
but he tries his best and i have never had the problem with the guy
so many reviewer here seem to have .
as for tracy griffith as the psychic ,
the less said the better .
but kober is pretty good as the killer ;
always liked that actor .
`` the first power '' may be just what the doctor
ordered after a hard day 's work
and a `` ain switch-off '' is needed .
beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience
and i will definitely have load of it the next time i give this movie a spin .
all in all ; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fan
who were easily scared as kid .
`` see you around 
buddy boy '' !
