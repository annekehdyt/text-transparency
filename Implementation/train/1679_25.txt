as a person
who sought out an existence as a 'professional ' person with income
backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management ,
my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgence in thing more artistic .
my post-post graduate class were always emotionally and spiritually
supported by an interest in photography 
stained-glass 
ceramic 
metal forging/welding ,
and art drawing
that also included silk screening.i also keep healthy with jogging 
walking and lately 
hiking to remote destination in california and nearby state like utah 
arizona 
and nevada .
jogging 
walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time
to stop and watch and listen
and also photograph or record sounds.within
that background 
i was obsessed with river and tide .
i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skill and smoothness of director/cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer .
i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer.wonderful .
wonderful .
wonderful .
