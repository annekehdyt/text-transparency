joshua seftel 's first film - a satire of memorable proportion - is about just as the title suggests :
the corporation effect on war.the film is about a mercenary
( john cusack )
traveling to turaqistan
( not a real country 
fyi )
to help the american government 'get their message across ' to turaqistan 's leader .
he meets a reporter
( marisa tomei )
and we all know
what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter .
somewhere in the mix 
a pop star
named yonica babyyeah
gets thrown in .
as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan 's most important person
( a son of the president ) ,
a subplot is created
where the mercenary must watch over this star 
well 
somewhat .
the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar ;
no more than fifteen second later ,
the film hooks you .
with it is amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politic 
the film 's running time blow by you .
the film has a lot more action than i expected ,
with the occasional scene of war 
well choreographed fight and just sporadic scene of murder .
though the story is not much deep ,
the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect
for both the common man and movie critic alike.in the final act of the film ,
the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled .
i thought
it was executed very well ,
but other may disagree ,
and i could understand why .
twist
after twist is what
the ending is all about 
and like most film ,
it is a true hit/miss situation .
regardless 
the three writer on the film
( mark leyner 
jeremy pikser and john cusack )
did a fantastic job
creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today 's situation
overseas.joshua seftel does an excellent job
insuring the film 's integrity ;
not reducing the material to the most redundant of film
( which i was afraid
would happen ) .
seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could :
he created a viant atmosphere 
one
that is both examine harsh reality and cartoonish falsity ;
- contrasting them perfectly - as well
as making the film feel
as if you were watching it all .
seftel really gets you involved in all of the action
and it pays off completely .
no missteps here .
hopefully 
he takes on more directorial job ,
for he is one director
to look out for .
