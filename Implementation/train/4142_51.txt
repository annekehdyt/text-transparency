i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time ,
so i was anticipating it greatly
when it arrived .
my worst fear were
that it would be plodding 
as well as ... well ,
you know
what all the screaming fan girl were babbling about ?
gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love ?
that sort of thing ?
dreading it .
i was very ,
very pleasantly surprised .
the movie was surprisingly watchable ,
even if the filming and music did make
it feel
like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scene ,
and the acting on gackt 's part was quite good .
hyde ,
being 
um 
hyde ,
acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character
that anyone
who saw him on stage
would hardly be surprised by .
he is one of my two major beef with the film itself .
but the rest of the cast
( including the child actor in the opening scene )
were very good
at doing what they did-
which was 
mostly 
get shot at
and yelled at .
but my second problem was very minor ,
having to do with the goriness .
it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene
where someone is shot
they either slump over 
really most sincerely dead 
or lay there burbling for a rather long time .
but sho just ... takes the shot ,
repeatedly 
keel over 
bubbles a lot
while he talks ,
and makes hyde cry .
all in all ,
if you are a fan of any of the actor or just a j-film fan ,
it is definitely worth a watch .
