steven seagal ... .how could you be a part of such an awful film ?
i rented this movie
because your movie usually have been pretty clean .
i have lost a lot of respect for you
being in an awful movie such as this one .
very 
very poor taste !
i am embarrassed
that i even rented this movie .
steven ,
if you keep acting in movie like this one ,
i believe
that your career is over .
my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movie
because you always can `` get the bad guy '' with a few hand maneuver
and make it clean ...
and also the language is pretty clean in your movie ...
but this one is something else .
i will think twice
before i rent another movie of your .
