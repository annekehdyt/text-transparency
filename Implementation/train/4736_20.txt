this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment ,
promising to develop into something worth
hanging on for .
but it does not .
it is flat 
self conscious 
unimaginative and tedious.a series of set image and backdrop do not make a film ,
they make a calendar .
this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary
( `` it is true it really happened '' )
not only fails to entertain ,
it fails to convince ,
so it does not even function as social history .
clich\u00e9s co-mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish ,
the amusement factor
wearing off fairly quickly .
the character are one dimensional ,
never developing to the extent
that one feel for them .
the director 's ego is the largest character in this film .
