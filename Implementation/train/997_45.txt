a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molass and haphazardly connived comedy .
peter ustinov try hard here to ing something to life
but the result is a dour bore
that misses all the right beat
that might have made it watchable .
regardless of the favorable comment here ,
this film is awful .
badly directed .
badly edited .
badly acted .
badly written .
you need to sit through a hundred movie
to come across one this bad.the muddled
and excruciatingly laggard plot concern ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company
in order to hack their computer and embezzle million of pound .
how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility
( he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight
by reading some pamphlet ,
and hoodwink computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identity )
.as a side plot 
ustinov romance fellow loner maggie smith ,
who just happens to become his secretary by chance
after he gets a flat in her building .
she ends up sharing scene
that have sexual undertone with bob newhart
that go nowhere ,
while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit
and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden .
then he marries smith
and they fly off to brazil ,
which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since
( nun on the run ?
a fish
called wanda ?
)
the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before .
by the end i was thinking
i must be truly off my rocker
to stick out drivel like this .
even a cameo by cesar romero did not help it .
one of the most unfunny 
poorly paced 'comedy ' i have ever seen ,
and certainly the worst caper .
do not waste your time .
if you love this you need to see better film .
