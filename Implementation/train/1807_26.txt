i think
it is a great movie .
because you get to see how diana 's life at home is .
she got so much aggression ,
and she wants to prove
that girl can fight too .
i think
she and adrian were great actor .
because of this movie i am boxing too .
it really impressed me .
the only negative part i think .
is the end .
because it is alright between diana and adrian .
but you do not get to see how it is at home .
and i did not really like it
that you also do not get to see how her father is doing 
and her other .
but i think
it was a great movie
and i think
i am going to watch it a lot more : )
i recommend it to anyone ,
even when you do not like boxing ,
you get to see a lot more than only boxing .
i had a great time
watching it .
