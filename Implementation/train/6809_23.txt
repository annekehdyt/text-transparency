`` party girl '' capitalize on the tremendous charm of parker posey .
in fact 
at time 
the movie seems to be a vehicle
in which ms. posey is allow to play herself ,
as she normally is in real life.the film ,
directed by daisy von scherler mayer ,
is a treat for ms. posey 's fan .
ms. von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan
to show us this aimless soul
whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different club
she constantly frequent .
this is an era
that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market district became .
at least 
there are no pretension in the film
and we see down to earth person going about their life in a normal way ,
if we can call it
that way.parker posey makes an amazing mary .
it is because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more
than if another actress would have played mary .
she is the whole picture .
the rest of the cast is good .
