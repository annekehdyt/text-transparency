i heard about this movie
when watching vh1 's `` 100 most metal moment . ''
on the segment 
gene simmon
( who played a cameo )
and several other interviewee discussed
how utterly awful this movie is .
unlike most person 
i am often more curious about checking out movie
that have reputation for being ridiculously bad than 
say 
a masterpiece of cinema .
the advantage
of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out
that the movie are nowhere near
as bad
as person said ,
and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected .
that was my experience with `` trick or treat . ''
now 
it is hard to make a movie about a teenage boy
who receives message from a dead heavy metal star
by playing one of his vintage record backward
without person scoffing at the premise .
sure 
it is certainly a strange premise ,
but one that is never been done before !
give the filmmaker point for originality for pete 's sake !
if you are looking to buy the dvd ,
having no prior knowledge of the movie ,
do not be fooled into thinking ozzy osbourne and gene simmon are the star .
however ,
though simmon has a thankless role ,
ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend
( that is right 
a reverend ! ! )
who speaks out against heavy metal .
for one thing 
it is funny seeing ozzy with short hair .
and for another thing 
you can not help but laugh at the irony .
sure 
it is a cheap shot 
but an effective one .
the acting is pretty good .
i found the performance convincing .
the teen character are horribly clich\u00e9d .
so expect the usual array of jock and nerd .
and like in every one of these movie 
the pretty girl is a decent person
who has sympathy for the alienated main character ,
yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend .
why 's she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place ?
because the plot needs an obstacle .
no other reason .
but i can not deny
that one of my guilty pleasure is watching the evil jock in these movie go down ,
since i was an outcast in high school .
the movie kept my interest for the most part ,
but the third act is way too conventional
and caused me to roll my eye
as there would be one predictable situation after another .
but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth
viewing on a rainy day .
( 7/10 )
