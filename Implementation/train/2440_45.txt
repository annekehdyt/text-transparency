i saw this movie about 5 year ago ,
and the memory of it still haunts me to this day .
i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it ,
so i have only myself to blame .
but like most 
i did not believe all the negativity .
being a sandler fan ,
it just seemed inconceivable one of his movie could really be that bad .
i figured
it was just sandler hater .
i could not have been more wrong.what
we have here is a comedy
that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny .
that is actually quite an accomplish .
you would think in a 90 minute comedy ,
they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing .
but no 
it is just horrible .
it is not `` so bad it is good '' 
its just bad .
you can not laugh at how bad it is ,
you can only cry .
you wait patiently for a joke
that will at least make you chuckle ,
but they never come.have you seen the movie the ring ?
where the person watch a video tape and die 7 day later ?
if this movie was on the video tape ,
person would die instantly ,
by their own hand ,
and there would be smile on their face
as they realize
their agony has ended ,
and that would be the first smile
since they pressed play.you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is ,
unable to curb your curiosity .
do not .
please do not .
trust me 
i am doing you a favor .
there are 2 type of person in the world ,
those
that think
going overboard is the worst movie ever made ,
and those
that have not yet seen it .
