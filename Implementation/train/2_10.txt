for me 
this movie just seemed to fall on its face .
the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer .
i do not know
whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor ,
but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain .
he is a good guy ,
and that is always obvious in his performance .
other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story .
nothing very innovative .
