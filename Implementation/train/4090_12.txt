i managed to sneak away one night
and go to the movie theater to see this one ,
thinking i was in for a treat .
boy 
was i wrong .
considering the talent involved ,
this has to be one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
everyone in it was miscast ,
and i find it incredible to read on this site
that there are person out there
who actually liked it .
