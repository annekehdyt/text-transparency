let me start by saying
i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before ; however ,
i am in the video biz myself .
and coming from that perceptive ;
i can say ,
without a shadow of a doubt
that this film is what a short should be .
it has a very good story and another thing i love-
( an even better twist ending ) .
opening was very well done ,
i loved video
chosen for it
and how it was edited.i am not a fan of bandw
but the way this film uses the effect it works .
and with any film that is all that matter .
the flow of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done .
from a technical side of thing
( which is side i
normally work on )
everything is also very well done .
there is no major tech .
stuff to point out .
only minor one i have is that the end credit are a little bouncy .
this is probably due to a rendering issue .
let me also say
that i would have prefer to seen more of the love scene
but i am guy
( so you can chalk
that up to a guy factor )
.so overall i rate it a 9/10 .
it is worth the watch
if you fan of indie and/or short films.ps .
sorry for bad grammar or spelling .
