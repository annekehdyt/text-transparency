ugh !
where to begin ... first ,
campbell scott 's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile
( a very short while )
as he internalizes his mounting anguish 
curiosity and anger .
only we do not care !
these character
as presented by the writer and director
are wholly unlikable ,
and therein lies the key .
they have not given us anything
to make us care if
they are adulterous
and whether or not they are still in love with one another .
when scott quietly tells his wife ,
`` i could kill you ''
before their three daughter at the dinner table ,
after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished
that he had
-- and then done the same thing to the smug 
wisecracking apparition of denis leary
before being hauled off the the looney bin .
an utter waste of time and perhaps
-- only perhaps --
resource .
