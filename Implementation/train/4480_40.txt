much to your presumable happiness fair reader 
cage and hopper did meet
and fortunately not in a lynch movie\u0097because red rock west is way better than any lynch movie .
nicolas cage is a third\u0097rate actor ,
the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal ,
only daddy hopper is as mean as ever .
red rock west is ,
despite the trite cast 
one of my favorite american thriller ; in a word 
a thriller with some twists.one notice mainly the gusto 
the awesome pace 
the thrill 
the nice suspense 
lara flynn boyle 's cute tight small ass 
cage 's enviable physical shape
( though undeniably ugly 
with sharp 
bird feature 
thick eyeow and thin 
rare hair ,
cage displayed a fine overall shape ) ,
hopper 's consummate routine 
some moderately but truly funny moment 
cage 's play with his intended persona 
hopper 's rigid 
psychopathic allure 
lara 's meanness 
cage seems a roamer 
the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema 
hungry 
tough
if needed 
naive 
dirty 
tired .
lara flynn boyle perform as the cold mean seductress ,
walsh as her heartless husband 
and hopper as the lynchian hit-man he is already done before.cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused
and having a severe hangover .
but this might be his regular look .
