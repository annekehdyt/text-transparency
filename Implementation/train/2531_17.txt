what a fun b-movie !
shepis is absolutely beautiful
and the scarecrow is a distinct and original .
he really ought me back to the monster of the 80 's .
the budget is obviously low
and not everybody is pacino behind the len
but it does not matter
because it never once takes itself seriously .
from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial art move of the scarecrow ,
this is truly a b-movie gem .
grab some refreshment 
snack and a couple friend and kick back and relax .
i enjoyed this film
so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow film .
sure 
they are not for everybody but to each his own .
sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile .
