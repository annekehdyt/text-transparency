the movie began well enough .
it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite ,
getting superpower
( telekinesis 
x-ray vision 
invulnerability 
flight 
the ability
to speak to dog 
superspeed 
heat vision ,
and the ability
to make plant
grow large and quickly ) ,
and fighting crime .
from there
on it is all downhill.meteor man
gets a costume from his mom 
fight with the resident gang ,
and has many aborted encounter with the gang leader
which serves to set you up for the disappointing 
overlong ,
and stupefying ending.it would not be so remarkably bad
if it were not like watching a boxing match
where the two fighter pretend to hit each other
while the audience stands
looking onward
while the fighter just continue to dance.despite all of this nonsense
the movie has good point .
it states clearly
that if you try to take on a gang alone
then they will come back to your home and hurt you .
it states
that gang and community need to see their real enemy
( the big boss
that use them for their own end
to crush honest person into a ghetto existence ) .
it also states
that person do not need superhero
if they are willing to work
as a community do destroy the predator
that harm them .
the only message
it really lacks
is that the voter should ensure their elected official
( rudolph giuliani 
marion barry 
ronald reagan 
george w. bush 
and george h.w .
bush ) are not crook too .
