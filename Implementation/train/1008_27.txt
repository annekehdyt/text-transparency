ok 
i really do not have too much to say about this film 
other than this :
i have seen over 4,000 film in my life ,
and more than 2,300 of those were horror film .
while i have some difficulty
deciding
which is the best
( as opposed to my favourite ,
which i can tell
you is george a. romero 's dawn of the dead ) ,
i can tell you without the slightest hesitation
that todd sheet ' zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i
have ever seen.there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film .
the acting 
the dialogue 
the directing 
the make-up 
the music ... every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable
that it boggles my mind
that this was ever even released.even
if you are a horror or zombie movie completist ,
please heed my warning
and do not waste your time on this garbage .
there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this .
you will not even get any laugh out of the utter ineptitude on display ... trust me .
please .
