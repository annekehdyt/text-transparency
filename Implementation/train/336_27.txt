a case of being in the right place at the right time .
what a fascinating film .
it is easy to see
why chavez is so popular with his person .
he gets thing done .
he is accessible .
and it is also easy to see
why the west hates him so much .
he has control of the resource of his country
and gives the profit back to the person .
mostly the poor .
and it easy to see how the tv station can portray misleading image to put there case .
just like the iraq war 
or the war on terror .
or those missing wmd 's .
or how about the axis of evil .
person need to wake up .
and get different point of view .
stop the neo con ruling the world .
go watch this movie with an open mind .
and make your own mind up .
then i suggest you see aaron russo 's :
america :
freedom to fascism .
it is not the person of america
that are the problem .
it is the government .
