the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 's soap opera .
deeply character-driven film are great ,
but only if the character are compelling .
and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire
to change the channel .
the villain 's dialog sounds
as if it were written by a romance novelist .
the great lt. columbo himself is no where near his famous 
lovable 
self-effacing 
crumpled self ;
and the ide/kidnap victim is a whimpering 
one-dimensional damsel-in-distress
( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on ! ! !
i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand
and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 second ) .
in any sense of reality 
this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little .
and speaking of reality ... .the story revolf around a kidnapping
which is worked
and solved by the police .
the police ? ?
give me a eak .
everyone knows
the fbi takes over every kidnapping case .
this was no columbo 
just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt. columbo
written in and stretched to 2 hour .
