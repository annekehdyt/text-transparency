first of all 
this is a low-budget movie ,
so my expectation were incredibly low going into it .
i assume most person
looking at the info for this movie
just wanted a bloodfest ,
and essentially that is all it is.plot ?
there really is none .
it is basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse .
cast ?
there is none 
period .
special effect ?
absolutely awful in my opinion ...
there were cutaway
and the blood was often completely unbelievable
because of amount 
splatter 
color 
texture ,
etc.i believe
the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a utal 
shock film .
now it had some great potential on a bigger budget
but poor scripting 
poor dialogue 
awful acting ,
what seemed like camcorder video shot ,
and just plain unbelievable `` gore 
''
made this movie truly awful.there are movie worth
taking a chance against some review ,
even `` b-rate '' movie deserve some opportunity
( blood trail for example was the most recent i saw against review
that was worth it ) ,
but this was simply awful .
i hope
that person considering this movie read my comment
and decide against it.i am all for utality and shock ,
but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience .
save your time/money and chance something else ,
you will not be disappointed .
