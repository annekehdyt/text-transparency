mating game is a charming 
wonderful movie from an era gone by .
hollywood need to consider a charming remake of this movie .
my wife and i would go see it.it is an excellent romantic comedy
that my wife and i watched on amc.this movie has tony randall at his best .
debbie reynold is great 
as always .

we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of movie.too bad hollywood
does not make movie like this anymore.hey hollywood ... .time
to dig some of these type of script out of the old safe ,
update them a bit
( without spoiling the original movie and script
as you have done with other remake ) ,
and hold a casting call.a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen 
dvd 
and on cable/sattv.sn austin
