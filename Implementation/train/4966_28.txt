whattt was with the sound ?
it sounded like it was all dubbed.otherwise 
bad .
plot = bad .
accent = bad
( even dougray ,
and we live in scotland ) ,
acting = bad 
harp = bad 
sex scene - bad/cringeworthy.still ,
we watched it until the end in disbelief .
how could such a good roll call of actor perform so badly ?
will they ever get a decent job again ?
bad 
bad 
bad .
by the way 
we gave it 3
because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot ,
etc.and to the older reviewer - i totally agree ,
it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s .
how did it get made in 2004 ? ok 
ok ,
there were some ok bit .
they had a nice house in bristol .
dougray had a nice boat .
jennifer looked nice in a little outfit .
but how come the sister got all the man ?
