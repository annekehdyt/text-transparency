this movie reminded me
that some old black and white movie are definitely worth
the look.initially i had some reservation 
however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated .
i was very impressed with the mixture of drama 
suspense and comedy.arthur askey
( tommy gander )
is hilarious
and had me in stitch the whole time.definitely add this movie
to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometime depressing and `` too '' powerful
or overly `` funny '' movie of today .
