everything i
remember about it
was excellent ... great cast with sam waterston and george inne
( before he became more familiar to us audience )
... .
excellent script
as only the english can do - edwardian sherlock holmes/lord peter wimsey/albert campion type mystery 
but with a jule verne twist .
sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england 80 year earlier ...
right at the beginning of the scientific/technological revolution of the 20th century.i have often wondered
if the creator of macgyver saw these show .
macgyver first aired about 3 year later.i still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape .
