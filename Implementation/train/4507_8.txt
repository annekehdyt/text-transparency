`` telefilms '' tend to fall under the pitfall of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule ,
which is why this film always tends to buck the trend.george c. scott embody ebenezer scrooge perfectly ,
fully encompassing all of his cold tendency ,
and still makes him a simpathetic character .
the production value for this film was exceptional ,
never relying on boffo special effect or soundstage set-up ,
yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrop .
a movie that certainly stands alone .
