paul verhoeven
( genius and master film maker )
strikes back with the less than perfect ,
yet still fun in a `` dirty old man type of way 
''
hollow man .
the first two act are so good that the slasher final act disappoint .
yet i am giving a recommendation to this film
for it is mind blowing special effect
( perhaps the best so far around )
and two dandy performance by the lead .
verhoeven 's moral question are of course thought provoking ,
and
although the film turned off many ,
this movie is pretty soft-core for old verhoeven.two major flaw :
josh brolin
( aka walking ape-man )
and the whole deal with the elevator .
if there was an access ladder ,
why were they trapped down in the lab ?
a fun horror film for a saturday night .
