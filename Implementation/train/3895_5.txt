`` chinese ghost story '' is one of the most amazing hong kong film i
have ever seen.it is a illiant mix of fantasy 
comedy 
romance 
horror and martial arts.the film has some wonderful visual and amazing fights.i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue.truly original and refreshing film and another embalmer 's fine recommendation .
