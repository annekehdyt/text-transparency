`` magnolium '' is a preposterous ,
bewildering acting showcase
that adds up to very little .
like `` eye wide shut 
'' `` magnolium '' is an aimless series of episode
without any concern for coherence .
the camera swoops through hallway and corridor 
catching glimpse of sad character .
where is the reason to care for these person ?
the common theme seems to be person
who yell a lot ,
who can not care for other
( except for john c. reilly 's and philip seymour hoffman 's character ) ,
and are self-destructive jerk
who are either falling to piece or dying .
i was reminded of how much i disliked `` shine ''
because of the irredeemable monster of a father
played by armin mueller-stahl .
there are so many unattractive 
unappealing character here ,
why would we want to spend time with them ?
having said
that 
there is nothing held back about `` magnolium . ''
paul thomas anderson 's idea are splashed onto his canvas with abandon .
there are two idea in particular that bomb .
both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film .
one has the camera flipping from one character to another
while each one sings one of aimee mann 's coffeehouse folk song .
sweet 
but ineffectual since we can not see what strings them all together .
the other idea i refer to can not be revealed other than to say
it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous .
`` magnolium '' has a lot of great acting .
particularly tom cruise
who unleashes a performance i
did not know
he had in him .
and john c. reilly plays maybe the most decent
and truly good cop in recent memory .
but it all adds up to nothing .
when the secret unexpected event happened ,
a girl behind me in the theatre could not hold it in any more
and said ,
`` this is stupid ! ''
my feeling is the majority of moviegoer will agree .
