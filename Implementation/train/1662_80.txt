the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minute
to keep the audience hooked .
late night shopping manage to avoid interest for much longer than that .
when we do get to a point ,
it is so monumentally moronic
that i kept thinking
i must have misunderstood it .
but i did not.sean tell the story of an osaka landlord
who rented the same apartment to two person at the same time
who worked different shift
and so did not realise
they were sharing .
his friend asks `` but what about the weekend ? ''
sean does not have an adequate explanation .
sean then tell the story of his own similar problem ,
which is that
he is not sure
his girlfriend is still living at home
as he works during the night
and she works during the day so
they never see each other .
this has been going on for three week .
but his friend does not ask :
`` yes ,
but as i said before 
what about the weekend ?
you must see her then .
it does not make sense .
what are you going on about 
sean ?
are you on medication or something ? ''
but let 's be generous and assume
that they both work seven day a week.we see sean checking
to see
if the soap and towel have been used .
( in fact 
bizarrely 
he starts to carry the soap around with him . )
but what about his girlfriend 's conditioner and shampoo 
sanpro and moisturiser 
toothpaste and toothush .
let 's go to the kitchen .
what about food and drink ?
is any missing ?
has any been bought ?
in the bedroom 
has the shared bed been made or not ?
are her clothe being used
and exchanged for clean one ?
is the laundry basket fuller ?
in the toilet 
is the seat up or down ?
i mean 
good grief ! and to cap it all paul arranges to leave work early
to see
if his girlfriend is still living at home .
why does not he just phone her ?
but it gets worse .
in the last act although no-one told vincent
where the rest of the group are going he manage to find them .
lenny 's love interest and sean 's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friend
and also manage to find the group .
there is not even the slightest attempt
to explain any of these
extraordinarily unlikely coincidences.to be fair the dialogue
is ok but not nearly good enough
to make up for the weak character or annoyingly lame story.i
heard one of actor interviewed
and he promised `` no guns 
no drug 
no corset . ''
i thought 
`` great '' .
but after half-an-hour of tedium i was yelling at the screen :
`` i want guns !
i want drug !
i want corset !
`` it would not have taken much to sort these problem out but on the official website the director boasts
that the film was not script-edited .
that is all you need to know .
