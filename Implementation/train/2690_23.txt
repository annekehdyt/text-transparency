i was glad to watch this movie free of charge
as i am
working in the hotel industry
and this movie came lately to our movie liary .
nothing against low budget movie ,
but this movie has horrible acting and directing .
how can a movie as this one ever be made .
the director should be blacklisted ,
and for all the poor actor 
it is for sure not a jumping board into a career .
please make sure
that you will not watch this movie ,
the acting is lame 
the camera and directing awful .
there are just a few more movie out there
which deserve to be called the `` low 10 '' .
another example would be `` dracula 3000 '' .
person
who make money with this movie
should give it to charity ,
so at least it serves for a good reason .
in this case i would watch it even another 10
( or at least one more time ) .
