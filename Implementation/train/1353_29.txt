the first episode set the bar quite high i thought .
it starred william hurt as a hit-man
who is contracted to kill a toymaker .
we are given very little information on his character
or who is paying him to kill ,
indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all .
returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package
containing toy soldier ,
this gives him a smile
but he dismisses it
and goes about his business .
but he is in for a night of hell ,
the soldier are alive
and are about to wage war ,
driving jeep ,
shooting machine gun and bazookas and even flying helicopter ! .
the special effect are good for a tv show
and it becomes quite tense
as he dodges around the apartment
using his wit to survive ,
sometime getting the upper hand and other time not .
i wont spoil the ending but suffice
to say
it was a clever little twist .
this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment ,
the other episode were all rubbish
and i lost interest by the fourth one .
stephen king adaptation are always a mixed bag
and these are no exception
