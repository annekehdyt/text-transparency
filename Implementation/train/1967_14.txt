i know a lot of person do not like this movie ,
but i just think
it is adorable .
there is not much i
can say ,
but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess .
the song are beautiful ,
the costume are beautiful ,
the voice are beautiful ,
and there are a lot of funny line in the movie ,
especially as briggitta learns about the do 's and do not 's of society .
if you like musical ,
i would say
you would like this one !
