this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech and chong flick .
it is the first one i saw with these guy .
i found it to be really good .
my dad actually recommended me to get it .
what a great role model 
and my grandma actually bought it for me ,
knowing what it was like .
what a family i have .
well this movie is pretty good and great to rent
when you want to see a good classic .
i must warn you though ,
this is not gut-busting funny .
it has its moment but not as funny as there is something about mary .
check it out anyway .
i am sure you will laugh .
unless your an anti-drug activist or something .
