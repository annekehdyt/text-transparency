the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget `` halestorm entertainment ''
has had to work with .
all involved should be fined for littering
since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more
than filling the trash .
not only is the writing atrocious and the joke awful ,
but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best .
the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guy laptop pc .
the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing .
i think
just because i could not believe
that i had actually paid
to buy a ticket
and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the `` film '' .
