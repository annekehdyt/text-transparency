it is depressing to see
where jackie chan has ended up .
he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punch 
kick and incredible stunt .
to be fair ,
he is now in his fifty
and one would expect some slowdown .
but with 'rush hour 3 ' 
where he takes a back seat to chris tucker
( of all person !
) ,
and then there is 'kung fu panda '
where not only is he in a purely vocal role
but his character barely has any dialogue ...
to say
that jackie chan has seen better day is a colossal understatemant.it is time like this
when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arse in his younger 
fitter 
chris tucker-free day.enter 'police story ' .
jackie chan plays kar-kui 
a policeman
whose task
it is to protect a witness before a major trial .
he faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit man
sent by the mob
to silence them both.but on the other hand ,
who cares ?
we do not watch jackie chan film for the story .
we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye-popping stunt and generally punch
and kick a whole lot of person
who are less awesome
than he is.and on that level 
'police story ' does not disappoint at all .
there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end
that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant 
high-voltage chandelier .
seriously ,
if this sort of thing happened more often ,
no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.there
is also comedy ,
much of which involves kar-kui inadvertently upsetting may
( maggie cheung ) ,
his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend .
the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle ,
but it works
so i am
not complaining.the acting is not too subtle 
either .
indeed 
i am not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story ' at all .
director jackie chan
( yeah ,
he does that too )
clearly has a deep understanding
of why we watch his film ,
and knows
that
while we are waiting for the next fight to start ,
the last thing
we want
is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.so 'police story '
is a blast .
as is the case with most of his film ,
the fact
that jackie actually does the stuff
you see on the screen puts it head
and shoulder above the competition .
i mean ,
when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umella 
a whole new `` wow ! ''
factor is added to the action .
