i had to compare two version of hamlet for my shakespeare class
and unfortunately i picked this version .
everything from the acting
( the actor deliver most of their line directly to the camera )
to the camera shot
( all medium or close up shot ...
no scenery shot
and very little back ground in the shot )
were absolutely terrible .
i watched this over my spring eak
and it is very safe
to say
that i feel
that i was gypped out of 114 minute of my vacation .
not recommended by any stretch of the imagination .
