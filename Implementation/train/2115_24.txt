the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disaster
so sad
to start a millennium with such nonsensethe film seems to suit 70 's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000anywayz some classic gem from the film :
paresh rawal i do not understand to laugh at his role or cry reason :
he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is
when he realises a secret of anil
he keeps the secret in his stomach
which becomes big
and makes him look pregnant i
remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf ! ! ! !
as a child i laughed at it that time but here ?
the whole film is a joke can not explain
we have anil in a dual role
( one older and younger )
and rekha
playing the older 's wife and raveena the younger
we also have reject harish
while shakti
playing the son of aruna irani
who both fight on
who has the worst wigdirection
is outdated music
is badanil try hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate ,
raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo
