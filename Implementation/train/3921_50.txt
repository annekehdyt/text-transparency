sentimantal and naive but undeniably affecting 
emotional man-helping-man plea 
in this case personified as german and french miner forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thank to a new border ,
leading to disillusionmant on the german side ,
as the french are the boss .
but when a fire begins on the french side ,
the common decency of the german man lead to assistance 
safety and even friendship .
this was a plea
that would fall on deaf ears within the decade ,
as a certain man from pabst 's own side would eak
that piece and turn the great war into merely a prelude .
but it is obvious to me
that pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamantal humanism ,
as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant 
cynical adaptation of the threepenny opera lacked the bite needed
to make
that work work .
also furthering his honest belief are the fact
that the character here are not simplistic mouthpiece for position 
but real person 
with real family
whose home lives we are privy to as well .
these are ordinary 
working-class man
who just happen to believe in the worth of caring
and treating right your fellow man ,
and in this day of individualist opportunism 
i will take a little thinning in my plot
to get a positive message
that represents a point of view
that i think
we can all aspire to .
( note :
apparently the ending is cut on most print ,
where the french rebuild the mining gate 
closing off the man once again .
this is a utal turn of event ,
and may have made the film a better overall film ,
but i would have lamanted
it souring the positive vibe of the final sequence 
so in short ,
i am glad
it was clipped . )
