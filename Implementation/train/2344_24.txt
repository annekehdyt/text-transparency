i am sorry ,
but this is such a bad movie
it is hilarious .
football hooligan arguing in a travel lodge ?
suit ?
shade ? !
alan clearly had no idea
what he was talking about
when he made this ,
it is as far from the truth
as you can get.the casting
was atrocious ... gary oldman as a football hooligan ?
he does not look scary 
act scary or even come across as someone
who would like football .
and as for yeti ?
what the hell ?
suit 
shade
and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with `` its about time
you got your nappy on '' .
please.and the yeti 's gang spraying the icc 's underwear ?
i do not see how anyone can even take this film seriously ! .4/10 .
its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighty hooliganism i have ever seen .
