gender bender sex thing up a bit for the x-file .
this episode has an interesting premise 
a good story 
but an ending
that is wanting .
gender bender is also the x-file debut for actor nichola lea ,
better known as alex krycek .
in this episode he plays michael 
a man
attacked by one of `` the kindred '' .
you need to see this episode just to see nic lea 's less than spectacular beginning .
an interesting thing about the kindred 's `` power of seduction '' .
when marty does it to his victim ,
they become turned onto him/her .
however ,
when andrew seduces scully 
she only because disoriented and groggy ,
and does not become attracted to andrew .
maybe it is because marty has more experience at it than andrew .
this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia .
throughout the episode it is so wet 
soggy 
and muddy ,
it could not have been that much fun .
despite the disappointing ending ,
gender bender is still a decent episode to view .
