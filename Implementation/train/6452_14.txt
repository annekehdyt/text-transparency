it is a cooking competition show 
americanized .
it is not going to be the japanese version.the show is great .
i could care less about cooking
but this show is just entertaining to watch ... from the intensity put into the dish by the chef to the goofy chairman .
truly a good way
to spend some time
watching tv .
you could critique the show
for having guest like marc ecko as a judge ...
but ... meh .
it is entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize .
oh yeah and i
am bitter john besh is not the new iron chef ... ala cuisine !
