tiempo de valientes fit snugly into the buddy action movie genre ,
but transcends its roots thank to excellent casting ,
tremendous rapport between its lead 
and outstanding photography .
diego perettus star as dr. silverstein 
a shrink
assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz
( luis luque ) ,
who 's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hood
who seem to have been involved in am arm smuggling conspiracy .
diaz has been suspended from duty ,
but he is the best man for the job
and must have professional psychiatric help
in order to be reinstated .
silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy
involving argentina 's intelligence community and some uranium ,
and the film separates them at a crucial point
that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skill of his own .
perettus and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer ,
though perettus is not as classically handsome as hill .
remarkably 
even at almost two hour in length tiempo de valientes does not wear out its welcome ,
and indeed writer-director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film 's charming coda .
all in all 
a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy
that neither pander to the lowest common denominator
nor insults your intelligence .
