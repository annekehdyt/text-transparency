this is a superb movie ,
suitable for all but the very youngest ,
though accessibility for younger person was marred
( at least in the print
which i saw )
by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub-titling !
for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess
in which time-period it is set -
there is no modern technology
shown 
not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle 
just a drab 
almost monochrome 
everyday life ,
against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celeatory firework .
even when a group of soldier refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war ,
this could still be any time in the past 150 years.but
then we iefly see a motor car - late 30s 
early 40s style -
and we realise
that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheaval ,
and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution.which makes the central character 's desire to adhere to old custom and tradition all the more poignant.but the film also raises issue
which are of vital importance even today 
both within china and in other part of the world :
the inequality between boy and girl 
man and woman ; the trade 
for various purpose 
in young child ; corruption in society ; injustice ; the importance of friendship.maybe i am reading too much into this film ;
but i do not think so !
i also think
that it is a scandal
that film of this calie are often not shown in the united kingdom ,
whilst dross is passed off
as quality material.but do not get me started on that ...
