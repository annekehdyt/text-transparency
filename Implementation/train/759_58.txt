there is an all star cast here ,
including tom cruise 
pen\u00e9lope cruz 
cameron diaz 
kurt russell 
jason lee and noah taylor
who all give good performance in the movie .
in the movie they all put off different thing about there character 
like happiness 
sadness 
angry 
etc .
really well .
there is also a cameo in the movie from the illiant ,
steven spielberg.vanilla sky is a well made 
different 
interesting and original movie
which will leave you
talking about it a lot
after it is finished .
it is not just a thriller ,
but it is a real psychological thriller .
the trailer for the movie is really good ,
but the movie is so different
from what it might be made out to be .
it is been directed very well
and there were a couple of really great scene here too .
all in all 
an enjoyable movie
which should be really
be paid attention too .
they are sure making a lot of `` are they dead ,
if not who is dead ''
movie recently .
