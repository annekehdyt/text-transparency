the japanese have always had incredible ambition in their fantasy movie .
they have always been ready to destroy city by huge plastic monster coming from outer space and elsewhere .
the problem is they
have never had the money
to succeed
in making convincing special effect .
this film ,
released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l'espace ,
is no exception .
its ambition is to show three creature from the giant octopus to the giant lobster
trying to have the upper hand on the human .
it is extremely awkward and laughable ,
but well quite enjoyable too .
after all 
we do like these creature and these film after all ,
do not we ?
