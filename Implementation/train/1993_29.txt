just watched this movie on dvd
and thought
the acting was very good ,
but the over all story left a lot
to be desired .
this movie has the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy .
hard to believe
that human being can live this type of lifestyle ;
on the underbelly of society ,
in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use 
crime 
violence 
sex 
and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything ,
including themselves.val kilmore
is outstanding in his role of `` burnt-out '' former porn star john holme .
the supporting cast is just as good .
however 
this is a bleak 
dark 
disturbing 
and depressing film .
the murder was utal ,
but the daily life of these person were utal as well .
unless you have an interest in these murder
or were a `` fan '' of john holme ,
this really is not a film to see .
if you want to see a docu-drama on murder ,
truman capote 's 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better .
