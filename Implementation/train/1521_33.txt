this film 
for an after school special 
is not that bad ,
and that is the problem .
nothing happen .
you feel
as if you are still in class .
a guy teaches a bunch of young underdog
how to be good paint ball player .
we never get to see these underdog
doing badly
as the good player is training them .
they all of the sudden turn into good player by meditating .
also there are too many character and no character development .
too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister
and not enough on some of the other kid .
this could have had a 'bad news bear ' feel
( the original )
since there was a girl on an all boy team ,
but there was not any feel to this movie at all .
it has no feeling
and leaves a dull pain in your bone
after watching it ,
is not fun to bag on 
not fun to watch ,
and is just kind of ... there .
plain .
boring .
something you would watch after school before your pre-evening nap .
as dull as the day is long
and it is been a long 
long day
watching this movie .
