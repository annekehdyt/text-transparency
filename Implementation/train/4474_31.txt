i have to point out ,
before you read this review ,
that in no way 
is this a statement against iranian person ...
if you really want to read something into it ,
than hopefully you see ,
that i am against politician in general ...
but if you are looking to be offended ... i
can not help you ! not in iran
as this movie is banned there
( see imdb trivia for this movie ) .
which is a shame ,
because the movie is great .
would it not be for `` grbavica '' ,
this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin.rightfully so
( it was the runner-up 
or second place
if you will ) .
why ?
because it is a movie about oppression .
it is not even that this is a complete woman issue .
it is about the government trying to keep the person down .
an analogy so clear
that the government felt the need
to ban the movie .
but by banning
it nothing is resolved and/or
can they make this movie disappear !
another reviewer had a great summary line :
`` comedy about a tragedy '' ,
that sum it up pretty well !
