during the opening night of the vanty a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage .
as the show continues the police attempt to piece together
who killed
who and why
before the final curtain.i had always heard
that this was a great classic comedy mystery
so i was excited to find myself a copy .
unfortunately no one told me about the musical number
which go on and on and on .
while the number certainly are the type
that hollywood did in their glory day ,
they become intrusive
because they pretty much stop the movie dead
despite attempt to weave action around them .
this would not be so bad
if the music was half way decent 
but its not .
there is only one good song .
worse its
as if the studio knew
they had one song 
cocktail for two ,
and we are forced to endure four version of it :
a duet 
a big production number 
as the vanity finale and in the background as incidental music .
i do not think
spike jone and his city slicker ever played it that much .
the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie .
charle middleton is very funny is his scene
as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.by no mean essential i can recommend this
if you think
you can get through the musical number ,
or are willing to scan through them .
its a fun movie of the sort they do not make any more .
