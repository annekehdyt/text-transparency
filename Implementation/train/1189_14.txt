this movie is just plain bad .
it is not even worth watching to make fun of it .
the lunatic professor is just plain annoying .
even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility
( which i glady do for the sake of good bad movie )
and allowing for exceedingly stupid victim in a horror movie ,
this movie asks for even more than that .
if you are looking for woman 's locker room shower scene ,
and random sexual encounter 
get a porn ,
if you are looking for a good-bad movie ,
get something else .
if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie 
rent this .
