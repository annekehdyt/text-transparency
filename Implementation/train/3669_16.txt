i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film .
the humor seems to be destined for corpse .
it is slow .
the story is too simple to be true .
the character do not raise much sympathy 
a few non-important character aside .
nothing surprising happen .
what did the writer of this script think ?
`` oooo funny !
let 's make some old lady 's high on pot !
let 's make them ... . giggle !
let 's make them ... behave like little child ! !
oooo 
yes 
that is absolutely illiant and original !
`` this film has irritated me most from all the film i have seen in the last five year .
