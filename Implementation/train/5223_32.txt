a horribly pointless and 
worse 
boring film .
stranger than fiction has nothing new
to say about anything 
no character beyond the most unimaginative stereotype ,
and rely on a clunky central concept
that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .
will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey 's truman show ,
and substitutes his usual shouting routine
( admittedly very funny
if you discount talledega night )
for 
well 
pretty much nothing .
emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating
( that some review i have read here
are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable )
whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script
that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student
who dropped out of harvard
to become a baker
because she liked making person happy .
please .
that she ended up falling for ferrell 's 'character ' is utterly ludicrous.marc forster 's attempt to jazz up the film
using computer graphic
only serve to highlight the uninspired the material
he has to work with.i
had the choice
of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this .
i wish
i would opted for the prestige .
