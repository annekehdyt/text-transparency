as part of the celeation of the release of casino royale 
this film with the new bond
starring in it was shown 
from director roger michell
( notting hill ) .
i almost turned it off
for being a bit boring ,
but i am glad i stuck with it .
basically may
( anne reid )
is a single mother of helen
( anna wilson-jone )
who hardly sees anyone
and has not had a boyfriend in year .
her daughter says
that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend 
darren
( daniel craig 
of course ) .
after knowing each other only a few day ,
may and darren have a secret affair .
and at her age 
with a 30-something 
and the new bond ? !
anyway 
they obviously want to keep it a secret ,
but may has regret and wonder
if helen will find out .
when she does ,
darren gets less hassle than may .
in fact 
helen asks her permission to hit her .
also starring peter vaughan as toot 
danira govich as au pair 
harry michell as harry 
rosie michell as rosie and johnny english 's oliver ford davies as bruce .
very good !
