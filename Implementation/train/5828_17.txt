i saw this film
( it is english title
is `` who 's singing over there ? '' )
at the 1980 montreal international film festival .
it won rave then ... and disappeared .
a terrible shame .
it is illiant .
sublime 
ridiculous 
sad 
and extremely funny .
the script is a work of art .
it is been 19 year
and i have seen only a handful of comedy
( or any other genre ,
for that matter )
that can match its originality .
