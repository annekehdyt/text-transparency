if dick tracy was in black and white ,
the pope would not be religious .
giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie ,
we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world ,
and it is one of the few movie
which succeeded in doing so ,
thank to a serious script 
good direction 
great performance
( al pacino is astonishing )
and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography 
art direction and costume design .
using only primary color ,
the experience is quite different from anything
we have seen before .
and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre 
pratically extinct from modern cinema .
overall 
i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema
which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formula .
7/10 .
