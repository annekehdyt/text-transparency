my watch came a little too late
but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together ...
which makes me compliment the maker of this flick
for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism ...
and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationship !
as a lot has been written about the movie already ,
it would just be appropriate to highlight few portion of the movie
which i personally loved.i think
the point where jesse and celine make phony phone call to their respective friend was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs ... the curiosity of two person
who both think
the other has made an infallible impact on the other
has been very smartly dealt with ... on the plot front ,
making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..i believe in romantic flick of such flavor ,
the character are not clearly designed even in the writer 's and director 's mind .
what the actor ing out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong
even the idea bearer would find it difficult to justify ... to become the character ,
the life the actor gives has to go beyond instruction and the story ... here
both the actor do just the right job !
kudos.. ! !
!
and before sunset is another feather
which makes this one even more beautiful !
