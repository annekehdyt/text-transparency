i have seen this film several time ,
and watched it today
( on tcm )
solely because of geraldine fitzgerald .
she is a much underrated actress
and i have to admit
i have had a crush on her since i first saw her
( probably in `` wuthering height '' 40 or more year ago ) .
the real star in this movie 
however 
is paul lukas ,
and he deserved all the accolade
he got .
he makes it clear ,
whether we like it or not ,
that the end justifies the mean .
naziism had to be stopped ,
and anything
that helped do it was good .
he gave his child a line about being bad ,
and that they should not be bad ,
but as he said earlier
when conversing with adult 
he would do this sort of thing again
without hesitation .
lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man
caught in this situation ,
and made it clear
that what he did was a very hard thing to do.some person
think
his victim was a nazi ,
but i do not think
so - i think
he was only after the money .
his nazi associates knew this
and that is why
they did not have much use for him.one interesting point in the film ,
and presumably also in the play 
is the fact
that muller
( lucas )
is a german .
while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii ,
there was considerable anti-german sentiment
and some german were interred similar to what happened in california with person of japanese ancestry .
it was something of an act of avery for hellman
to write a play about good german at this time
( maybe she thought
they were the one
who signed the nazi-soviet pact ! ) .
after all 
the us and british air force were bombing german city
and having no qualms about killing innocent civilian .
i think 
however ,
that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later ,
after `` watch on the rhine '' was released.the title is something of a play on word ,
as the `` watch '' is looking west 
from germany .
in fact 
watch am rhein was a german army marching song -
used in wwii ,
but the nazis had their own marching song
that was used as well .
but muller is a german
and he is engaged in his own `` wach am rhein '' .all the other actor did an excellent job here ;
although bodo was too much
there are child like him .
i am surprised
he did not give his father 's secret away .
in real life 
he may very well have done so .
