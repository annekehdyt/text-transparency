of life
in ( some ) college .
of course there were artistic license taken ,
but some of what you saw in this film go on in some college.i went to college in southern california
where the race pretty much hang around with their own .
it is funny
because these are school
that want racial unity 
equality etc .
and i can honestly say ,
that it is there .
but the thing is when class lets out ,
or when they are just hanging out waiting for class ,
they
( student )
seem to just hang around with person of their own race or ethnicity .
is that bad ?
not really .
everyone needs a feeling of belonging .
but like the school paper of one of the school i attended once wrote about that ,
`` we should all try to hang around with student of other ethnicity
and try to know them . ''
otherwise you are creating your own segregation.racism certainly existed in one of those school i attended .
one time someone put leaflet around campus
talking about the glory of the aryan race
and had the symbol of some of those racist organization .
fortunately 
nothing happened like the incident in the movie
where the young caucasian man went off
and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.i can only hope and pray
that nothing like that ever will happen.so
is `` higher learning '' overly dramatic ?
exaggerated ?
maybe .
is it way `` off mark ? ''
it depends on where you went to or go to school .
the race thing
where the ethnicity just hang around with their own does happen .
minus the hollywood exaggeration ,
the race thing hit pretty close to home for me .
