six different couple .
six different love story .
six different love angle .
eighty number of audience in the movie theater .
looking at the eighty different part of the silver screen.i am
sitting in somewhere between them
looking at the center of the screen
to find out
what is going on in the movie .
all story have got no link with each other 
but somewhere down the line nikhil advani
trying to show some relation between them .
i tried to find out a few line i
could write as review but at the end of 3 hour 15 minute found nothing to write .
the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually.my suggestion .
do not watch the movie
if you really want to watch a nice movie .
