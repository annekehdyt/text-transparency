... for the lt to have chosen this one .
first 
the film was not horrible ,
it was just hollywood .
worst case i-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie scenario :
if willi ' mission was to save the doctor ,
but she was adamant
that her `` person '' make it out of the missionary ,
he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugee to the border
without her .
he would not have compromised his package for the refugee .
that is not how it works .
but ,
as i pointed out 
this is hollywood ,
we must have drama .
this is why we make movie ,
because reality is not quite so complicated .
however 
i did think
that willi and the good doctor had workable chemistry .
that said ,
there are also some well done battle scene in the film .
it is not a waste of time ,
`` tear of the sun '' is worth the dvd rental fee .
check it out on a rainy day
and you will be satisfied .
