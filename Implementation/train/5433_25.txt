i entered the theatre intending
to pass a pleasant 90 minute
being entertained if not enlightened .
i left neither entertained nor enlightened .
this movie can not make up its mind
what it wants to be
and ends up being not much of anything .
there are a few funny line and a few incredibly pretentious movie reference
( the 400 blow
-- for this character ?
come off it ! ) .
while none of the character gets treated with much respect ,
the over thirty gay man get the worst of it :
all predatory 
fat 
sad 
slobs .
if you are in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationship check out parting glance ,
longtime companion 
trick 
all over the guy 
red dirt 
maurice 
philadelphia instead .
you will thank me .
