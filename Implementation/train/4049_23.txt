oh where to begin .
the cinematography was great .
when the movie first started
because of the initial landscape scene i
thought
that i was in for a good movie .
then the cgi bigfoot showed up .it
looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong 's love child.it totally took away from the believability of the character.now i knew
there was not a bigfoot chasing person hiking around the wood for no apparent reason
but a cheesy cgi cartoon.so from then on the whole movie was shot for me.the money
they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did .
his was the best bigfoot costume ever no
one else could match his.i
am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie
but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i
was disappointed like the previous review warned me about .
i know
after you read this review
you will still say
`` i must watch sasquatch hunter 
must watch sasquatch hunter . ''
then you will say
why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie !
