i was forced to see this because a ) i have an 11 year-old girl and b )
we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movie from the 1930s ,
which she thoroughly enjoyed .
personally 
i did not think
it was as humorous as the 1930s flick ,
but on the other hand 
it was not the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff i feared
it would be .
it was an inoffensive ,
mildly entertaining movie .
although i am pleased
that they did not try to `` upgrade '' nancy to 21st century `` hipness ''
( veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew ) ,
i do think
that they made her a little too bland ,
that they did not do enough
to develop nancy drew -
the movie could have been titled `` jane doe 
girl detective '' .
i have to blame the script :
i think
each actor did a good job with what
they had to work with .
i liked emma robert in this role ,
but they gave her a made-for-tv 
not theatrical release 
script ...
