really ,
they spelled it brain in the credit 
not brian.ok ,
they did not have the budget for a spell checker .
all the production money went for great old car .
there are at least two packard visible here .
one is a darin convertible .
a nice yellow packard convertible.the scene of the movie studio show
that there was some money
spent for costume and set decoration .
old camera 
an exterior of ciro 's 
street sign and whatever was needed
to make a visually pleasing picture was there .
poorly written and directed.my dvd says
it runs for 104 minute 
approximately .
it was more like 85 minute .
it came to an end
without reaching a conclusion .
there was a collision but no conclusion .
the movie just smashed up against the credit .
99 cent for this .
i paid 99 cent for this .
i could have bought 3 can of cat food
and watched my cat 's face
as he emoted more excitement.for a few second in the ciro 's scene
after darren mcgavin gets a phone call ,
it looked like ,
maybe ... this movie would have a surprise twist
that would make for an interesting film .
then it just sat there.the young latin actor
played by steven bauer
( tony montoya )
could have had a much bigger part in all
that was going on here .
this cast could have made a good film.i think
if they cut brian 's part and use steven bauer in his place
and change the script
and keep the packard
and lose the band
and add a johnny otis sound alike band ,
then they got something.here kitty 
kitty ... tom willett
