i simply love this movie .
it is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising story
that come out of asian cinema .
there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie 
with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez .
please do not confuse the two movie .
the original japanese film is touching 
subtle and wonderfully acted .
the hollywood version is the exact opposite .
i was aghast
when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version
and who was starring in it .
it is typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it is worst .
the remake cements the argument
that some foreign film can never be improved upon .
the only reason
the original film did not become more widely viewed
is the us audience 's aversion to subtitles.one of the main reason
this movie would never work in an american
telling
is that the reserved 
ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie .
certainly the main character awaken to a more full understanding
of living a vivacious life through dance ,
but half of the movie 's tension comes from the stereotype and ridicule ballroom dancer face in japan.please
try to see this movie
in it is original form 
not the terrible full screen .
and please do skip the us remake ... .it is a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese movie.ye ,
i know
the `` original '' movie is much older ,
and this is simply a japanese take on the story ,
but the only two person are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remake.speaking of foreign film ,
i will make a few quick recommendation :
1.monsoon wedding-i list this first for a reason 
outstanding film !
2.johnny stechino-very funny italian mistaken identity flic !
3.shiri-a korean action pic
that mixes both asian flare and us style plot 4.run lola run-a german film
that integrates it is techno score ingeniously.well ,
just a quick list anyway :
