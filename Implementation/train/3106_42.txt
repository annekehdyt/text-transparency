white fire was recommended to me by a guy
who owns it on two separate dvd release and on vhs .
he claimed
it is one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioner ever made .
i generally do not watch movie knowing that they are going to be bad ,
but i made an exception for this one ...
and i was very glad
that i did.it is filled to the im with action
( much of it surprisingly 
graphically gory ) 
sleaze
( isolated to nudity with a key female character ,
but there is so much of it in one scene
that it becomes hilarious )
and outrageously awkward dialogue ,
all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film.ginty ,
the unusual looking star of the exterminator
( and countless other low budget action turd )
is amusing in the lead ,
giving the best performance he could muster .
williamson is better than usual ,
clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee
( and he does not come in until midway through ) .
the rest of the cast is also fun to watch 
particularly the villain 
one of whom is a sadistic sexpot
who speaks with an accent
that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian .
she is priceless.again ,
i can not stress enough
how gory it was .
it is not so bloody
that it is nauseating ,
but it is uncommonly violent in part with some meaty squibs going off in the shootout
and it has a grueling torture sequence
that no man will soon forget .
also ,
when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guy ,
he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moment
that follow will have any and all action fan cheering and spilling their beers.do not miss white fire .
it is a rollicking -
if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic .
