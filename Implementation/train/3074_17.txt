i will just be vague about my potential spoiling comment .
there are enough canned plot element in this movie
that it is essentially pre-spoiled.this movie derives a few idea from a southern classic ,
to kill a mockingbird .
i suppose maybe tkom got its idea from some source ... . at any rate ,
after you watch this ,
you will say ,
`` oh yeah ,
that is a ripoff '' .i
think
the truly entertaining thing
about these mcmovie is once
you have identified a plot element ,
is to figure out
whether they will stick with the original ,
or try to twist it around .
not a lot of twist in this one .
