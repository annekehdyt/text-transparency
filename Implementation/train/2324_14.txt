terminus paradis was exceptional ,
but `` niki ardelean '' comes too late .
we already have enough of this
and we want something
new.big director should have no problem
seeing beyond their time 
not behind .
why person see romania only as a postrevolutionary country ?
we are just born not reincarnated ,
and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old time .
most person do not remember or do not want to remember ,
and the new generation of movie consumer do not understand a bit .
this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi !
maybe younger director should make the move .
