this oddity from roman polanski clearly shows
where his preoccupation lay at the time he made it .
polanski himself plays a timid man
who rents a parisian apartment
where the previous tenant committed suicide .
he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it 
to the point
that he is dressing in drag and reenacting event the way
they might have unfolded .
the movie 's unsettling to a point ,
and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread
that polanski excel at 
but it comes off too much as a rehash of `` rosemary 's baby '' and `` repulsion 
'' two other better polanski film
that deal with the eerie going on in moody apartments.but
as for the preoccupation ... .unless i am reading too much into the film ,
i have to believe
that this was polanksi 's reaction to the feeling of persecution
he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from america .
not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself ,
but it is hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.grade :
