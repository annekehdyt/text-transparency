first of all 
do not call this a remake of the '63 film .
even though this version is truer to the stage play ,
it is extremely long .
the casting was good with some exception .
chyna phillip was not a good casting choice .
she was almost 30
when she did this film ,
and it was hard to believe
she was a teenager .
jason alexander was good choice ,
but after a while he gave me a headache .
tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson .
george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee ,
and showed
he could even hold a tune .
like the '63 film 
they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie .
marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie
and it showed .
i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing .
so what made this a tv rating flop ?
it was lengthy for one .
they put in new song and scene .
even though some of the new song were good
( like `` let 's settle down '' ) ,
was it really necessary ?
now do not get me wrong 
i liked it ,
but i rather watch the '63 film
( see my review ) .
this was just a case of some actor overdoing role ,
making some change ,
and once again 
length .
one more thing i forgot to mention
is vanessa william .
she does a good job with the role and the music .
give her any lyric and she could sing them .
so here is my advice coming from someone
who 's done a couple production of bye bye birdie :
if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play ,
watch the '63 film .
if you want to watch a version
that is truer to the play 
watch the '95 version .
just take it in moderation though .
do not be a hero
and try watch it all in one sitting .
