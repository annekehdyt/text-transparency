a bit of a disappointing film 
i would say :
the acting was stilted 
somehow .
in many case 
i just could not feel
that the facial expression matched the word spoken or the intent of the scene .
an angry
( or sad 
happy 
frustrated )
character should make the viewer believe
that he is angry
( or sad 
happy 
frustrated ) .
that does not happen here.the comment about the writer
assuming
you already know
the character was apt .
they do thing
and say thing
which come out of nowhere :
the character andrew accuses his parent of sending signal to each other at dinner ;
then he blows up and storm out ,
telling his father `` do not touch me ,
you f*** ! `` .
maybe ,
if we 'd seen the prequel ,
we would understand
where all
that comes from ,
but there is no prequel ,
so we are somewhat at sea as to the reason !
one odd 
quirky thing
that andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry ,
sit down on the edge overlooking the `` still water '' below ;
then he reaches into his jean pocket and extracts a pack of cigarette and light one up .
he did this same thing three time during the film ;
i guess we are supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry ?
maybe once ,
but three time ?
it might even have been four time ,
i lost count.to be honest ,
there is the fact
that he is recently found out
that he is adopted ;
this happens very early in the film
so there is no sense of any dramatic change
he might be undergoing
because of this discovery .
it is not really clear
if that is why
he is so bitter
or if
it is about something else.i guess
there is a sort of lynchian
feel to the film
but should a first-time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career ?
