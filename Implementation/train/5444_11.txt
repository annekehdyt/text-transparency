i remember
watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old
and really enjoying this .
i recently had the opportunity
to watch it again ,
for the first time since then ,
as it was aired on `` walt disney present '' on the disney channel .
i would forgotten most of it ,
and some of it was geared toward kid ,
but it was still enjoyable .
i can not wait to show it to my niece and nephew .
