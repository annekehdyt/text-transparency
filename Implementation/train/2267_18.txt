here is one of those movie spoiled by the studio 's insistence on a happy ending .
conflict
which have stretched out for year
are settled in a few minute .
it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity .
the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind
she has put down all her life .
brent 
as usual 
is well over his head
and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young
playing a character
named gig young .
someone mention `` gig young ''
and then who appears but gig young 
the actor !
worth
seeing though far below what it could have been .
