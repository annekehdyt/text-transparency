this is one of those little christmas movie for everyone .
our scrooge is ben affleck ,
who decides money is not enough ,
so he rents the family
who lives
where he thought his family did .
ok ?
this is a great little high school soap 
pg-13 ,
but the small sex reference are comedy ,
so if your kid can not handle them ,
they can not live in the real world 
either.now ,
affleck is a hunk ,
and as usual walk through this fun 
omg 
remember
when we did ... 
ensemble piece
as if he were at the end stage of some neuroinfectious disease .
but that is ok ,
because even this old oracle keeps hoping
that if ben 's that well proportioned all over 
well 
there is hope for us ladies yet .
luckily 
the rest of the ensemble -- catharine o'hara 
jame gandolfini 
christina applegate 
udo kier and josh zuckerman --
fill
in and keep this shadow-side-ozzie-and-harriet christmas alternately hilarious ,
comfortable and warm.this movie is the kind
you can jump up and get popcorn ,
and
when you get back ,
everyone wants to back it up
to show you what you missed.this is a happy film 
after all ,
and it leaves you feeling good about life 
love 
family 
christmas and chanel .
there really is something for everyone .
