now i will be the first
to admit it
when i say something
that may be blasphemous or unfair ,
so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie.that about sum it up too .
i disliked this movie .
to be more specific ,
i disliked the concept of this movie .
the cinematography was good .
the mood was nice .
and the acting was satisfactory .
however 
the story is fatuous 
unacurate and misleading .
it is also offensive.i am a quarter cree indian ,
and for some reason i feel insulted 
on a personal level 
by the nature of whitaker 's character .
first of all 
he is a black guy .
and this is not a racist remark 
i swear .
the thought of a white 
hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offend
everything
that the katana represents .
the katana represents the soul of a samurai 
imbibed with the soul of his ancestor who guide and protect the samurai .
for ghost dog
to use his gun instead of the katana
is also an insult to the blade and the soul inside ,
and where the heck did he get a katana anyway ?
it must be one of those replica ,
which insults the samurai caste even more.also ,
ghost dog showed no honor .
near the end of the movie 
he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window
and then assassinates a man
by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain .
not only is this a coward way
to kill an enemy ,
it is more like a ninjas way ;
silent assassin ; a group
that samurais deny exist ,
but hates none-the-less.then
he tries to kill his boss ,
when he finds out his boss is a baddie .
you know what a true samurai does
when he learns his master
is proven bad or dishonorable ?
he kills himself ,
to prove
that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.everything about the character
was a giant contradiction to the real code
that all samurai adhere to :
bushido.so 
we have great cinematography 
good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise ,
( which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it ) ,
making it an unsatisfactory overall film ,
and an insult
to everything a honorable bushi
( samurai )
holds dear .
