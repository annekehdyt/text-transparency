sandler is amazing again ...
i have already become a sandler fan .
this movie is the saddest sandler story .
its expression is fantastic .
i cried more watching click
but there are some similar point .
to consider the value of the family
before losing it
and to be able to say
'i love you ' are a few of the most impressive truth in life ...
it is tough ,
it is real ...
and actually there is a real owner of this success 
binder .
i do not think
another director could give these emotion in such a way .
cheadle and burrow are also amazing ...
cheadle is one of my favorite since crash .
do not expect laughing or much positive atmosphere ...
if you are ready to face the reality of life ,
do not miss this movie .
