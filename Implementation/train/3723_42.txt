going into see seven pound i was not clearly sure what to think
because the preview left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about .
so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot ,
have no idea
what is going on and you think tim ,
who claims to be ben ,
is just a big asshole .
all of this comes to an end
when the `` twist '' ,
so to speak ,
is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie .
basically tim
( will smith )
was troubled and haunted by a big accident
he made causing the end of seven person lives .
by this he decides to scope out seven new person
who are in need of help badly
who he in turns gives his life to.the acting of this film is great ,
as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress .
rosario dawson 
to me 
this is one of her better movie ,
aside from eagle eye
which
i think
is up there to .
she has been in some bad some good
but she does deliver in this film .
other actor 
such as woody harrelson 
have very small role and not a big enough role
to grasp the character .
although the casting of the film was still good.this movie was definitely not what i expected
and certainly a lot slower pace
in which i hoped .
the movie 
however 
was still pretty good .
nothing is revealed
until the last 5 min of the movie and everything fall into place .
up until then it just seems like a pointless love story .
final thought seven pound=seven star .
