nicely done ,
and along with `` new voyage '' it is a great continuation !
fab to see jame cawley in the latest episode `` vigil '' check
it out !
i like the growing characterisation ,
and think
we have good replacement for the tv actor in a fan-produced piece .
this show manages to capture the feel quite well ,
as they state on the ste ,
it has improved over the year with experience and i hope with some more experience 
a strong script editor 
and a pick-up in timing and cgi
that hf will becoming more remarkable
than it already truly is ! good work to all concerned !
( i have a huge soft spot for lefler and mcfarland
( great acting ) ,
although i am a bit tired of `` lefler 's law '' .
enough already !
shelby 's great
( if a little uptight )
and it is cool
she got the ship .
commodore ian 's nice
( like fred flintstone ) ,
but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer
and does seem too pleased with himself .
the doc 
counselor 
and rawlin are right on the money in my eye ,
as is the wonderful nechayev
( what a beautiful accent - a real russian !
( well 
i am guessing rene hail from the czech rep. )
it gets my vote ,
and the cgi is kewl .
some of the greenscreen 's obvious 
but on a small budget whaddayagonndo ? really glad i found it !
( ok 
some of the acting is not great
but it is fan-made
and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry cmm .
cole )
the gay material is layed on too thick
( graham norton 'd be embarrassed ) .
trek does not pay
that much attention to hetero couple
so why signpost gay with all the snogging ?
it is not necessary to showpiece someone 's sexuality to this extent - i hope
they tone it down
and let aster and zen be person not tokens - i do not treat my gay friend any differently ,
they are just regular guys.musically
it is a mixed bag .
i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time ,
but timing can fall flat now
and then
( the end of `` worst fear part 2 '' misses the crunch 
and the edit .
love the fact
they use the `` galaxy quest '' music !
i certainly can not wait for more ! !

never surender !
