maybe i have seen one too many crime flick ,
or maybe i do not take the right drugs.this was the most clich\u00e9 ridden 
plot deficient 
plot-absurd ,
just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time.as for the direction ,
it looks like it took less time to show this
than it did to put it together.in fact
it looks like to made it straight to video
before it was completed.it is a bad rip off of `` m '' the classic fritz lang film
starring peter lorre .
you would be so much better off renting that instead .
