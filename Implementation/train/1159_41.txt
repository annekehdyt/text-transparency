watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling
over it
while zaping channels.i guess
we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christma movie ,
but were extremely disappointed.the actor
playing the soldier ,
seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever ,
his face looks the same ,
whether he is chopping down christma tree 's ,
seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend 
or when he is happily surprised by the girl
he loves ,
he is an awful actor ,
and at no pont did any of us do nothing
but laugh at him.then there is the cute blond girl ,
blessed with the ability
to count dot 's and cheat on her boyfriend 
what a catch !
and her ambition in life is to live with her parent and count more dot.so
it is basically a story about a guy
without any emotion or feeling
who falls for a guy
who count dot and cheat on her boyfriend ,
it is as predictable
as it get 's ,
and really a waste of time ,
you gain nothing by watching this 
other than some weird laugh ,
because it is all so corny.i love it
when her dad says
that he only eats french fry and not french wine ,
and they all laugh ,
that is the hillbilly attitude this movie
is about 
furthermore ,
if my girlfriend dad were bossing me around like ,
i would tell him a thing or to 
but not our army veteran 
no sir 
he let 's everyone boss him around.the movie is what first blood would have been ,
if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world .
