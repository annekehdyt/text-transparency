this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making .
it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable 
from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.the unbelievable plot revolf around an attempt by two british soldier and a hindu gofer
to rescue a third soldier
who has been captured by insurgent indian .
in the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipe
marching into an ambush .
in the british army 
a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt ,
and
if you get past that ,
he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant
when there is a full regiment on hand .
the indian insurgent are so incredibly inept
it is laughable ... there are hundred of them
but they can not hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuer 
of course not .
at one point we see the british soldier throwing block of stone down from the battlement at the insurgent ,
who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush ...
one would have to have an eggplant for a ain
to think
this would do any damage .
after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot ,
he lies on the floor
looking around at the water boy ...
hardly the action of someone
who has been shot in the back .
the water boy avely blows a bugle
( which comes from nowhere )
to sound the alarm ... this
he does by standing up high on a wall
so he can be seen
and shot by the bad guy ,
and we shed a tear
as he keeps trying to sound more note
as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call eaks up into feeble squawk ...
instead of blowing the bugle
while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a ain would do .
this scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketch .
if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy ,
they should have hired keaton
and done it better .
