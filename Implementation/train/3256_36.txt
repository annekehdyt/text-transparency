make no mistake ,
maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever ,
and there will never be one more gorgeous .
she is visually stunning .
that aside ,
it takes more than a beautiful woman
to make a good film .
this is a great film .
it not only has the classic tarzan aura ,
but also the feel of the continuing saga .
we become involved with the two white hunter
who search for ivory 
one of them in love with jane 
the other 
a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best
defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterization are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic .
there is the uncomfortable racism
which is depicted .
however 
the african are depicted as individual ,
and at the end 
two even become more heroic than the white hunter ,
and stand out as such .
in fact 
the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other character .
the finale 
also 
is one of the reason
to enjoy this movie .
the great lion attack has never been duplicated ,
and the horror is well implied with character reaction more so
than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction .
if i left anything out ,
it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those
who have not seen it .
but it is everything you could want in a movie .
