i have watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime
that have showed in the us
and this by far has the best story .
the way its plot twist
and turns has u riveted .
gundam wing is a series
that mainly focuses on politic and war .
the series follows a group of five 15 year old boy
who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suit
known as gundam .
the gundam pilot were trained to battle a powerful insurgency
known as oz .
as thing begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilot ,
new political group will form and old one will dissipate .
old conflict will end
and new one will arise .
to obtain peace
the gundam pilot must come to grip with the event
taking place in their world
and put an end to all the fighting .
but 
how far are person willing to go to obtain their goal .
i recommend this anime to anyone
who is looking for a show
that has a deep plot .
