the acting itself was not even that bad ,
since it did't come to mind in the movie
but whatever had this director in mind ?
the intended climb toward some climax completely missed the mark ,
..almost all scene
involve acting
that stand so far from our own intention and way
of reacting on thing
that you do not really attach to any actor in the movie 
..empty silence 
..in this case 
see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical illiance ,
..which just was not here at all 
..i guess
i am bitching but shit 
..2 hour of my time 
..
