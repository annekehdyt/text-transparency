i admired rob marshall for chicago ,
but memoir of geisha turns out to be yet another failure
of combing western and asian art .
overall 
the scene is beautiful ,
but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scene some might just find himself fed up with them .
the excessive cherry blossom was 
frankly 
overdone .
it is probably the cultural difference of perception here :
the ultimate beauty is not the showy type ,
as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie .
some other comment have rightly mentioned the biggest flaw .
as a taiwanese 
i have no doubt
the actress are great .
an actor/actress can play any kind of role
when he/she can look like it .
gong li is great ,
but the power of emotion
that she showed in this movie
had not been translated into japanese style .
all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman .
michlle yeoh 
one of my favourtie actress 
did not even look like a japanese .
some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate 
feminine characteristic of japanese woman ,
with which i can not agree more .
these are so delicate
that i assume not even all modern japanese actress are eligible for the role in geisha ,
let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress
who grew up in different culture
and probably did not know japanese culture
that much.geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audience .
but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike
if the movie wins the oscar for best costume 
best director or best picture .
