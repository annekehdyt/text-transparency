this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star
who is hired to coach a high school boy ' basketball team .
similar to goldie hawn 's wildcat ,
it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role ,
and she does as about as well as the script allows .
i think
racquel welch would have been a better choice ,
but considering the film 's apparent tv movie budget ,
they probably could not afford her .
cathy lee does look great in every shot ,
but we never get to see her completely nude .
the story is pretty predictable ,
to say the least 
offering no surprise .
a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role .
he is the star on the team
and also the love interest for cathy lee .
keenan wynn has a few amusing scene as the rich old man
who runs the athletic program
and does not think
a woman should coach sport .
this point is ought up throughout the film ,
and 
needless to say 
is dated .
ironically 
cathy lee does not put her team through any unorthodox practice session ;
she does not do anything a male coach would not do .
there is a funny subplot
involving a tall and not-so-ight player
who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his class
and play like pro basketball player sydney wick .
it looks like everyone had a good time
making this film ,
but the only real reason
to see it
is for cathy lee crosby .
she is not that great an actress ,
but she has a dazzling smile 
beautiful hair 
and a very tan body .
