laurence fishburne is a fine actor ,
and deserve respect for trying this ,
but he is not in a class with the great shakespearean like olivier and welle ;
and he further suffer from kenneth branagh .
this irishman 
always illiant 
cleanly steals the show away .
olivier recognized
that potential in his production 
and cast iago with someone he knew
he could upstage .
i did not nearly realize the possibility of iago 
shakespeare 's most evil character ,
but branagh show us the depth .
nice to see the view of venice 
too .
