i just read a review defending this film
because it had a low budget ,
now my take on things.the cgi monster was reasonable well animated
but was implemented in the worst possible way .
the fight scene were not even fight
it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all .
when the monster did interact
it looked like
it was done in paintshop pro .
in my opinion
if you have a low budget
you should use model and puppet .
they may not look as fancy but at least they interact 
just look at peter jackson early film.as for the acting beowulf did an descent job
but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot
where they where.the script seemed confused to me .
one minute they would be talking
as if it were a modern day
setting the next
you get drama club shakespeare speech .
i am not say
it should be all 'ye '
and 'that it be '
but you need to find a cohesive balance so the line sound
like they come from the same person.i did notice one part near the start
when beowulf was quoting the old testament
which would have been find
had he not spent the rest of the film
talking about the god and portents.in short ,
this film is a very slightly polished turd ,
but a turn none the less .
