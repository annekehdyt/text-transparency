oscar wilde 's comedy of manner ,
perhaps the wittiest play ever written ,
is all but wrecked at the hand of a second-rate cast .
sander is ,
as one would expect ,
casually 
indolently illiant in the role of lord darlington ,
but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time .
jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentence
and the other member of the cast seem
to believe
this is a melodrama and not a comedy ;
indeed 
the entire production has bookends
that reduce it to tragedy
-- doubtless the hay office insisted .
preminger 's direction seems to lie
mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servant about and even the music seems banal .
stick with the visually perfect silent farce
as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs. erlynne ;
or try reading the play for the pleasure of the word .
but skip this version .
