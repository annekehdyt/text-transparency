i am not saying
that night of the twister was horrible ,
but it was far from great .
mediocre at absolute best .
i seems
though
that every time one type of movie is released ,
a second must be around the same time .
( think about armageddon and deep impact 
volcano and dante 's peak )
night of the twister is really just twister
except worse and with mundane special effect.i have nothing against the actor
who starred in it ,
even if they were not great ,
it was the movie itself ,
the directing 
the special effect 
the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret .
a series of tornado strike a town
and basically the movie is about person
trying to find family and friend and deal with the damage.i really do not know
why it seems
as though duplicate of disaster movie are released almost in sync with each other ,
but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt .
