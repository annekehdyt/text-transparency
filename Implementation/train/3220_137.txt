warning :
this review contains spoiler .
do not read
if you do not want some point revealed
to you
before you watch the film.with a cast like this ,
you wonder
whether or not the actor and actresses knew exactly
what they were getting into .
did they see the script
and say 
`hey ,
close encounter of the third kind was such a hit
that this one can not fail . '
unfortunately 
it does .
did they even think to check on the director 's credential ?
i mean 
would you do a movie with the director of a movie
called `satan 's cheerleader ? '
greydon clark ,
who would later go on to direct the infamous `final justice 
'
made this .
it makes you wonder
how the person of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer `final justice '
and completely miss out on `the return .
'the film is set in a small town in new mexico .
a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night
when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hover over them .
in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film 
the ship spews some kind of red ink on them .
it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens
and dipped his leaky pen in it ,
so right away you are treated with cheese .
anyhow 
the ship leaves and the adult do not believe the child .
elsewhere 
we see vincent schiavelli ,
whom i find to be a terrific actor
( watch his scene in `ghost ' for proof ,
as they are outstanding ) ,
who is playing a prospector ,
or as i called him 
the miner 1949er .
he steps out of the cave he is in ,
and he and his dog are inked by the ship .
twenty-five year go by ,
and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd ,
who works with her father 
raymond burr ,
in studying unusual weather phenomena .
or something like that .
shepherd spot some strange phenomena in satellite picture over that little new mexico town ,
and she travels there to research it .
once she gets there ,
the local rancher harass her ,
and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilation
that have been going on ,
and deputy jan-michael vincent comes to her rescue .
from this point on 
the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other 
especially after vincent ward off the local and inform shepherd
that he was the little boy
that saw the ship with her twenty-five year earlier .
while this boring mess is happening 
vincent schiavelli 
with his killer dog at his side 
is walking around
killing the cattle and any person
he runs into with an unusual item .
you know
those glowing plastic stick store sell for trick-or-treater at halloween 
the kind
that you shake to make them glow ?
schiavelli uses
what looks like one of those glow stick
to burn incision in person .
it is the second-worst effect in the movie .
every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick ,
the scene 's atmosphere suddenly turns dark ,
like the filmmaker thought
the glow stick needed
that enhancement .
it ends up
making the movie look even cheaper
than it is.and what does all this lead up to ?
it is hard to tell when the final 
confusing scene arrife .
see 
burr and his team of scientist try to explain the satellite images
that shepherd found as some kind of `calling card 
'
but none of it makes sense .
why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not ?
schiavelli explains
why he is killing cattle and person
and why he wants shepherd dead ,
but even that does not make much sense
when you really think about it .
i mean 
why does not he kill jan-michael vincent ?
after all 
he had twenty-five year
to do it .
and the alien will not need him
if shepherd is dead anyhow ,
so why try to kill her ?
speaking of the alien ,
it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent .
what is their goal ?
why do they wait so long to intervene ?
how could they be so
sure shepherd would come back ?
not that the answer to any of these and other question would have made `the return ' any more pleasant .
you would still have bad line ,
really bad acting 
particularly by shepherd 
cheesy effect 
and poor direction .
luckily 
the star escaped from this movie .
cybill shepherd soon went on to star in `moonlighting ' with bruce willi .
jan-michael vincent went on to be featured in dozen of b-movie 
often in over-the-top part .
raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movie right up until his death .
vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of film .
martin landau ,
who played a kooky law enforcement officer ,
quickly made the terrific `alone in the dark ' and the awful `the
being '
before rolling into the film
he has been famous for recently .
you can bet
none of these star ever want their career to return to `the return . '
zantara 's score :
2/10 .
