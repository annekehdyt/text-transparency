written by oliver stone
and directed by brian de palma ,
scarface paint a picture not easily forgotten .
al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana 
a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world
as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida .
this gangster flick is harsh 
violent 
loud 
gross 
unpleasant
and must hold the record for uttering the word `` f
-- k '' the most number of time .
almost three hour long ,
and yes it can get repulsive .
a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat
cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.also
playing interesting character
are michelle pfeiffer 
steven bauer 
robert loggia 
mary elizabeth mastrantonio 
f. murray aaham and angel salazar .
pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation .
he manages to ing reality to his character
that leaves a strong impression .
this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking
you walked away from a disaster .
is that powerful enough for you ?
crime does not pay for long !
