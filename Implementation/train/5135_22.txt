i agree with most of the other guy .
a waste of photon and valuable time.nearly no joke is worth
the paper is was written on .
the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio .
( `` egal 
ich muss eh waldsterben '' )
this reminds of old time with rtl samstag nacht .
it is hard to describe the performance of the actor ,
since most of them do not even seem to have a good time during production
and just `` do their thing '' .
camera is ok 
plot is laughable ,
i think
you would be ashamed
even if you discuss this with lot of beers.apart from this i yawned all the time ,
wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production
and waited for the end.my 9 year old son
was pleased ,
but then he is pleased by so little at this age :
- )
anyway 
a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much ...
