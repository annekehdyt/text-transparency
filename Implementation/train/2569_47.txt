paul lukas played a russian intellectual
making his living as a waiter in '' grand slam 
''
directed by william dieterle
( 1933 ) .
it is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celeity .
the waiter and the russian restaurant 's hat-check girl
played by loretta young
become america 's sweetheart as idge partner
who do no squabble .
with the aid of publicist and ghost-writer 'speed ' mccann
( the wonderfully deadpan frank mchugh )
they become walking advertisementsfor the `` stanislavsky system 
'' a `` system ''
of bidding whatever one feel like
( since bid are not rational ,
there is no basis for recrimination about their stupidity )
.a duel with displaced idge guru cedric van dorn
( sounds close to goren 
no ?
and i suspect the choice of the character 's name `` stanislavsky '' was also a slam at another kind of system ) ,
a puffed-up charlatan
played very well by ferdinand gottschalk ,
is oadcast on radio station across america like a prize-fight by roscoe karn
( another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s )
.the idge player are even in a roped-off square ,
though the audience isabove them 
unlike in boxing `` ring .
`` the wide variety of american type prefigures the comedy of preston sturge 
though for manufacturing celeity 
`` grand slam '' most call to mind two better movie from the same
( pre-code )
era with lee tracy
playing fast-talkingpublicist :
`` the half-naked truth '' and `` bombshell 
''
but `` grand slam '' has itsmoment 
especially for anyone
who has played idge with serious pointcounters.loretta young
was already a clothe horse .
( to me ,
her face seems a bit longand horsey 
too .
another era 's notion of beauty 
i guess ... )
the movieunfortunately all but drop glenda farrell ,
who plays mchugh 's forgetfulgirlfriend .
