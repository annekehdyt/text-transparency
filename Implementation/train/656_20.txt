god 
i have not watched a movie this awful in a long while .
maybe not since 'the new guy ' or various freddie prinze jr. movie .
yes 
it is that astoundingly awful .
mira sorvino 's blank and wooden acting surely must 've been inspired by freddie .
the movie staging was awkward
( like a play 
rather ,
and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film ) .
the actor had no idea
what they were doing 
especially sorvino .
her accent was awful
and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing ' other character
and they 'falling ' for it .
and what was with the occaisional shot of a live audience in lawn chair ?
nonsensical !
i had to turn the dvd player off ,
it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film .
