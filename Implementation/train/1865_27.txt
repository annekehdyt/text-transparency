confounding melodrama taken from a william gibson story ,
produced by john houseman and directed by vincente minnelli !
richard widmark heads up posh 
upscale rural nervous asylum ,
where his loose wife battle with self-appointed queen bee lillian gish ,
and widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer lauren bacall ,
who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child .
facetious and muddled 
set in an indiscriminate time and place ,
and with a `` david and lisa '' love story hidden in the plush morass .
widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together ,
but this script gives them nothing
to build on .
for precisely an hour 
most of the dialogue concern
what to do about the drape
hanging in the liary
( this thread is not used as symbolism ,
rather it is a red herring in a non-mystery ! ) .
the picture hopes to show the loggerhead
that disparate person come to
when they are working in the same profession
and everyone thinks
their opinion is right ,
but unfortunately the roundabout way minnelli unravel this stew is neither informative 
enlightening nor entertaining .
