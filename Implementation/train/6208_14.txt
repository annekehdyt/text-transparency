bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist
who uses orchid
to woo ide
in order to steal life essence for aged wife .
the midget in this film is hilarious ! !
a lot of freak 
plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare .
i loved
how
all the piece fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion .
the story never gets interesting ,
and you feel helpless
as you watch.usually i would score bore flick like this one low ,
but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more point .
