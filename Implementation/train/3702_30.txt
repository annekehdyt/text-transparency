i claim no matter
how hard i seek i will never find a better movie version of `` othello '' .
if you love kenneth branagh 's magnificent masterpiece `` much ado about nothing ''
( 1993 )
and `` hamlet ''
( 1996 )
as much as i do i am dead certain
you will also find oliver parker 's `` othello '' irresistible .
laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid role during his career .
he was quite terrific in `` boy n the hood ''
( 1991 )
- i have always considered his amusing role of furious style as his very greatest achievement .
that was 
of course 
way
before i saw this.he play the part of othello
and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career
but he does a illiant 
fantastic job .
ir\u00e8ne jacob is absolutely charming desdemona
and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story 's crooked 
manipulate villain iago .
marvelous `` othello '' is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare 's ingenious work .
it deals with his favorite topic :
crookedness 
envy 
deceitfulness and jealousy .
this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest film i
have seen
that is based on william shakespeare 's play .
