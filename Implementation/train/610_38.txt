first of all 
i too was expecting another hero
-- a fantastic work of art for the action genre .
i have only seen part of crouching tiger hidden dragon ,
but i can imagine
that it is better than hofd.basic element from hero are found in hofd : great landscape 
mesmerizing cinematography 
and sincere acting
( i mean ,
if you can not understand a word
they are saying ,
without the subtitle ,
but you still care
-- that is good acting )
what went wrong ?
what begins with political intrigue wander into a love story .
worse 
it is a soap opera-like love triangle .
you have three character
who 
i guess 
fall in love with each other- for no good reason .
this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail
( i fell asleep about forty minute into it ) .
it is almost as if they changed writer at that point .
the remainder of the movie is about how a character is `` like the wind . ''
ick .
also 
you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief
to believe the action set piece .
this is not unique to this genre ,
but since the story is weak ,
you can not wait for the action ,
and then ,
when the fighting does eaks out ,
it really was not that good .
the beginning grabs you ,
but then this movie just runs out of gas .
