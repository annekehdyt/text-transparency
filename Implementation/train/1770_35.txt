having worked in downtown manhattan ,
and often ate my lunch during the summer day in the park near city hall 
i would see the mayor come and go .
it was great being able to go beyond the door of city hall
and see what it looked like in the lobby and through out the entire building .
al pacino ,
( mayor john pappas ) 
''
gigli '' 
'03 
gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture ,
and especially when he gave a speech at an african american church for a little boy
who was slain .
john cusack ,
( deputy mayor kevin calhoun ) 
''
runaway jury '' 
'03 
was a devoted servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything
he attempted to accomplish .
bridget fonda ,
( marybeth cogan ) ,
starts to fall in love with kevin calhoun
and gives a great supporting role .
last 
but not least 
danny aiello
( frank anselmo ) 
''
off key '' 
'01 
played a mob boss
who had some very difficult choice
to make toward the end of the picture !
great film with great acting and fantastic photography in nyc !
