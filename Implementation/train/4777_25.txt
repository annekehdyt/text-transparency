i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol .
1 collection of pure euro-trash movie .
but this movie has a nice stamp of approval
and should deserve a better transfer
than what is out there .
stupednous it is not ...
satisfying it is !
watching this movie i could not help to wonder ...
how come sergio martino did not make this flick ?
this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech
( alas not as well
known as she should be
but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii ) .
double-cross and triple-cross underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second .
did this guy have to go to italy
to finally reach his potential
or did the studio system let this guy slip through ?
besides lee 's more recognizable film ,
film-goer should try this on for size
and see how if sergio leone would 've lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time
( and 1/4 of the budget )
this is what it would 've turned out to be like .
so refreshing 
it should be taken in during the day at home
and make it for an couch matin\u00e9e
