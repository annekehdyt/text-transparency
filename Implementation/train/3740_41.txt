small spoiler alert ! !
! good movie ... very good movie .
and i am surprised to say
that myself ,
because i am not a big fan of vampire and the sound of the director 's name deran serafian usually means bad news .
most of his film are below average action movie like death warrant and gunman .
this was one of his first film and maybe
he should have continued making horror movie instead of action .
this movie really fascinated me .
good accomplishment ,
seeing no famous actor
or big budget was involved .
it really is the story
that keeps you focused .
especially fan of the original dracula myth will be satisfied .
sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story
and remains rather loyal and true to the truth .
it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula
and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpse in front of his castle .
of course 
that is where the reality and the `` based on a true story '' stop .
the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.in this movie 
the count
( vlad teppish )
emigrates to the usa and seduce ton of woman .
and they are all pretty girl ,
i will give him that .
overall 
good acting by unknown faces ,
enough blood and gore
to satisfy the more morbid horror fan and an interesting storyline .
this film is really unknown
and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore .
but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover
and put it in the vcr .
heck 
it is a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title .
these two film have nothing else in common ,
but i blame
that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture .
check it out ... my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10
