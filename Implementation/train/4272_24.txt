when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb .
i hate film
that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino
also just got very bad review .
the only reason i watched
it is because i like have liked keira knightley 
mickey rourke 
christopher walken 
and tony scott on other occasion .
i also just enjoy based on fact adventure story .
yes the editing and cinematography were frantic ,
the story was weak ,
and the acting was mediocre ,
but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason .
domino was very ,
very entertaining and often very funny .
it was horribly underrated
when it was released i think
because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire
and instead just got wonderful entertainment .
i actually understand
why everybody hated domino so much ,
even though i loved it
and recommend it .
