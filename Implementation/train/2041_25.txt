it takes gut to make a movie on gandhi in india ,
in which he is not shown as a man
who could do no wrong.this movie shows
how a mahatma failed to be a decent father
( at least in the eye of his son ) .
the performance are terrific 
the cinematography fantastic 
the direction fabulous ,
but the film drags.if the intention was to make this movie
without any box-office expectation ,
which i assume is the case here ,
then its a illiant attempt ,
but if the maker were expecting this to be a commercial success ,
then the film 's fate was doomed the day
they chose this subject..20 yrs from now 
this movie will be remembered for the illiant portrayal of harilal by akshaye khanna.he deserves an oscar nomination for this one..and honestly ,
his is not the only performance worth applauding 
shefali chhaya is terrific too..watch the scene
where harilal hears about his father 's death.no dialogue ,
no screaming ,
but a speechless
shot by khanna.it one of the finest scene ever
shot in the history of cinemagandhi ,
my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes 
its excellent cinema and a must watch.brilliant attempt..
