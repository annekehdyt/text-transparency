this was disappointing .
it started well enough
but
as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar ,
it fell flat .
marium schrader 's acting is dreadful 
never seeming to mean what she says ,
or even knowing what she says
until she says it .
she showed no genuine emotion at all 
not for her beloved goy 
or her mother 's story .
when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lena 's story .
there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother
except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding ,
which is not much .
the supposed parallel between hannah 's `` mixed '' romance
and her mother 's relationship with her father was as clich\u00e9
as they come ,
and failed miserably anyway .
the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish .
the climax of the protest was uninspiring ,
and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome ,
she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time 
a haunted look 
an inexplicable ambivalence .
in fact 
none of the character in the film had any depth or spark .
it was very hard to care about any of them 
even little ruth .
everything with luis was a distraction .
( why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel ?
there was no context or explanation whatever for that . )
if every reference to him was removed
it
would not be noticed .
a simple story made confusing by poor character development
( who was whose mother 
again ? ? )
weak acting ,
and directing
that made everyone look like they were acting .
you could almost hear `` quiet on the set ! ... . ''
i started thinking
this was worthy of a 7 ,
but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 ,
then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene .
this was about as cold and sterile a movie
as i have seen .
a terrible waste of a good story .
