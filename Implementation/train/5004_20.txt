when i first watched robotboy ,
i found it fresh and interesting 
but then i noticed ,
that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself ,
what is good/bad .
episode became predictable .
and main character are not interesting .
again we see a hyper-smart boy ,
beaten by his older other 
parent
who do not understand their kid 
and his friend : girl and fat boy .
also this show has no logic .
a super-modern robot
who works on two aa-size battery ,
and can use a lot of weapon .
but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated mode .
we see two different robot ,
and it declines main idea of the show :
`` robot must learn how to behave himself in human society ''
