when i first saw this film in the 1980 's ,
i was in my middle teenage year
and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the `` sesame street/muppet '' age .
i honestly do not remember
if i liked it at the time or not .
however 
somewhere in college i watched this film again ,
and it wound up going
( and staying )
into my personal best film ever collection.this film is loaded with humor
that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppet .
i mean 
obviously the muppet always have appealed to adult and child
because there is humor geared toward both generation .
but come on ... janice is accidentally overheard telling someone
`` i do not take my clothe off for anyone ,
even if it is artistic '' ...
there is a joke from a father to a son
that
if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father does not want to hear it ... gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
( sp ? )
and afterward says
`` i think
we are engaged now '' ...
these and plenty of other moment in the film had me rolling .
add to that very smart dialogue 
very smart new york/broadway `` wink wink '' humor 
the usual large amount of celeity cameos and some really enjoyable song
that do not border on `` kid-level cheesy '' whatsoever ...
this film is a masterpiece !
i do not throw `` 10 '' 's out on a regular basis ...
but this one deserves it .
over 20 year later 
this film totally holds up 
perhaps even more so .
the muppet never were
and never will be again 
as funny and smart and just plain illiant as this film was and is .
