this film is really vile .
it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s
and puts it into a school context .
i am not saying
that urban crime was not a problem for a lot of person
or that school were not/are not problem area
but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit .
violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable
but in this case
it is not a case of social issue but a white 
upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol .
and of course he knows how to play the system .
does that sound familiar .
yes .
this turd is pure violent exploitation 
a really nasty piece of work .
it is disturbing utality dressed up as a social comment .
this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator ,
death wish 2-5 and so on and so on .
the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so oke at the time
that he had to do stuff like this .
