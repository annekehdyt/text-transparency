to all the hater out there :
condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book
after reading the first few page .
that being said ,
i was a huge fan of bsg ,
thought
it was some of the best tv drama
( not just sci-fi )
on the air .
but it was time for it to end and the story
to move on .
i liked the bsg epilogue `` the plan '' ,
but it raised as many new question
as it answered ,
so i eagerly anticipated `` caprica '' and i was not disappointed.i was hoping
it would not try to be another bsg ,
and i was pleased
that `` caprica '' is something different ,
and i personally found the story exciting 
in a different way than blazing space battle 
explosion and sci-fi special effect
( do not get me wrong ,
i like that stuff too ) .
eric stolz and esai morale give solid performance ,
and alessandra was just wonderful .
i can not wait until next week .
