sorry to say
i have no idea
what hollywood is doing .
sure give us movie like batman begins .
oh 
by the way hollywood i think
they may cover the story line in the movie batman ,
but please do not entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together .
i really hated this trailer
because it left me wanting for more .
i was looking around
to see
when it was coming out .
it was like a terrible practical joke .
the graphic where good the story line seemed solid
and it had all the trapping of a great movie .
unfortunately it is not going to happen for now .
to the producer 
director and all the actor great job
but i hate you for doing this to me .
you left me wanting more .
