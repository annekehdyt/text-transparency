laurence olivier 
merle oberon 
ralph richardson 
and binnie barne star in `` the divorce of lady x 
'' a 1938 comedy
based on a play .
olivier plays a young barrister 
everard logan
who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room ,
when the london fog is too dense for guest at a costume ball
to go home .
the next day 
a friend of his 
lord mere
( richardson ) ,
announces that his wife
( barne )
spent the night with another man at the same hotel ,
and he wants to divorce her .
believing the woman
to be oberon 
olivier panic .
oberon ,
who is single and the granddaughter of a judge ,
pretends
that she is the lady in question 
lady mere ,
when she is really leslie steele.we have seen this plot or variation thereof dozen of time .
with this cast 
it is delightful .
i mean 
richardson and olivier ?
olivier and oberon 
that great team in wuthering height ?
pretty special .
olivier is devastatingly handsome
and does a great job with the comedy
as he portrays the uptight 
nervous barrister .
oberon gives her role the right light touch .
she look extremely young here 
fuller in the face 
with jean harlow eyeow and a very different hairdo for her .
she wears some beautiful street clothe ,
though her first gown look like a birthday cake ,
and in one gown she tries on ,
with that hair-do 
she is ready to play snow white .
binnie barne is delightful as the real lady mere.the color in this is a mess ,
and
as other have mentioned ,
it could really use a restoration .
definitely worth seeing .
