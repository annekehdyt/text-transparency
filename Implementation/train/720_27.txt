i know
it is a power-rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year old
but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ?
if they are going to write a plot with crayon ,
at least have the decency
to make it silly .
it is kind of hilarious
if you watch this .
we have a typical family filled with cliched character
( father a war veteran
who lost his wife
and blames himself lolol ) ,
air-head child trying to hard to fill the stereotype
but fails with horrendous acting ,
and a laughably horrid sidekick
who serves no purpose to the movie
but to fill camera space .
funny stuff ! however 
the real great moment comes near the end
when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight ,
but then they realize none of them know
how to
( probably because no room in budget for choreographer ) ,
so they come up with this american gladiator type setting
to run around in .
lol.1/10 rating
because they try to treat this seriously .
