i first read the book ,
when i was a young teenager ,
then saw the film late one night .
about a year ago i checked it out on imdb
and discovered no copy available .
i then hit the web
and found a site
that offers war film 
soooo glad
that i did ,
ordered a copy
and sat back
and was able to confirm
why i wanted to see it again.in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest
you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film .
the book is no longer in print
but i did track a copy down via e-bay ,
the author alan white was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war
taking part in disparate clandestine operation
and this was his first book .
it is written by someone
who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity .
i have not given the film a ten
only because of the nature of the ending of the film ,
not as good as the book .
there are a couple of plot line
that differ from the book also ,
which is strange
as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war .
the film illustrates this exceptionally well .
i have the copy of the book
to let my son read
and then the film to let him watch ,
in that order.if you can track it down the book and the film
then it is definitely worth it
and i only wish
that it was more readily available for more to read and see 
one of my all best war film 
ever !
