the same difficulty i have with the musical version of `` les miserable ''
apply equally to `` oliver . ''
instead of the composer ' writing in the stylistic period of the play setting ,
they merely wrote broadway-type melody ,
which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.too 
the blatant utality and unsavory activity of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditty
which permeate the score .
it is a uncomfortable mixture
that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.the casting of the boy oliver does not help matter :
tentative of time and vexingly precious 
there is something less than solid here .
fagin performs his traditional routine adequately ,
though the tune he is obliged to sing have little basis in period manner .
`` as long as he needs me '' is given a strident rendition 
throaty and strained .
the two big production number ,
`` who will buy ''
and `` consider yourself '' seem over-produced ,
with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in .
it is one thing to go all out ,
yet another to cross over the line into excess .
the gloom 
despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditty and choreography .
while the novel is considered a classic ,
i must confess i have trouble with mr. dicken ' consciousness ,
in that his work tend to emit a negative viation .
this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life ,
which was full of disappointment and regret .
not all the combined talent of this production 
either on- or behind camera ,
can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material .
all this result in an uncomfortably downer experience for me .
