i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minute of the film .
i managed to stomach 45-50 minute
before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead
( which 
by the way 
is great fun )
.the story has massive hole in it .
the plot line is hugely over stated and dull ,
the acting is awful 
especially from justin timberlake
who should really stick to what he
is good at
( looking daft
and singing like a castrato ) .
morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable ,
especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet .
freeman and timberlake 's character seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sort or something ,
which simply is not evident at all apart from the fact that ;
though freeman 's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake ,
he never the less pull out all the stop
to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.it
would take some incredible suspension of disbelief
to give any credit to the story line ,
which is simply absurd
and blown out of all proportion.do not watch this film ,
it is a pure waste of time .
