watching film i was in very light mood
and also this film is light
but the end of the film is just unexpected
which leaves a long lasting memory in one 's mind.movie starts with abhay and his profession
of being witness during registrar marriage .
soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend does not ,
leaving soha alone on to the street
she can not go back home
and she do not have any thing
to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her ,
this is the base of story.the rest is just watchable
and the end of the story is bitter sweet
that abhay has to face
which keeps you at the edge of the seat.dialogue and music are good song are ok direction is good and so
as the screenplay you do feel
that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story
it is all right.a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanut .
my rating for this is 8/10
