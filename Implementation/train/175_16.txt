i saw the description of the movie on tcm
and only let it run
because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith ,
so i was delightfully surprised to find
that i really liked the movie
and found it quite exceptional .
of course 
it is seriously dated ,
but as a period piece
it is well worth
watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty year ago .
now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often .
i also was quite taken with the performance of smith and ustinov as the lead 
and of karl malden 
bob newhart 
and the cameo appearance by robert morley and cesar romero .
