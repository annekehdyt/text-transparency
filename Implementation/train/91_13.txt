i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1
simply because i do not believe
there is a worse movie in the world.i hate this movie ,
i hate the acting 
dialog 
setting 
writing and directing .
i hope everyone
that was involved in this movie burn and rot in the darkest circle of hell.damn this disgusting waste of time.i pray every day
that this movie is just a figment of my imagination .
i pray
that i dreamt the movie ,
and that i will never have to see it at my local video store again.burn in hell
