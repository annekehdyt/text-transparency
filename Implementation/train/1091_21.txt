this is one of those unfortunate film
that suffered an even more sad 
unfortunate death at the box office .
i saw this film at a local art cinema 
in revival form ,
shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas .
it certainly deserves to be approached a second time
( or even a third ) .
sandra b. takes it to the limit
by doing spoken word
and taking on some well known song in this piece
( her version of hank william 's 'i am
so lonesome i could cry ' could easily move you to tear ) .
maybe someday 
audience will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously
( but not without some well placed laugh 
too ) .
the film move at a isk pace
( thank to some nice editing ) ,
so that some viewer will not find it stale and boring .
perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .
