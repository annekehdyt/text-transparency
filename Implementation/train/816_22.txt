a young
( only 21 )
director with great talent 
a powerful scenario 
young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background ... one of the first try of a thriller in turkish cinema ,
which seems in the future
we will have some more based on the success ...
shot on high definition video ,
the movie is perhaps effected on world thriller 
especially the american thriller .
the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done ,
the scene are all well worked on .
not too much blood
but sufficient enough
to make you think
you are in a blood bath too ...
the scenario is quite wise but with certain clue ,
a clever audience can easily predict what is going on and at the end
when everything settles down you are getting somehow weird
to conclude the result.well done tiglon 
one of the biggest dvd distributor in turkey ,
it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company ...
