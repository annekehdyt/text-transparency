critic need to review what they class as a quality movie .
i think
the critic have seen too many action film
and have succumbed to the matrix style of film .
europa is a eath of fresh air 
a film with so many layer
that one viewing is not enough
to understand or appreciate this outstanding film .
lar von trier show
that old style of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension .
the back projection effect he uses during the film arouse
and enhances the character ,
and the focus of the conversation they are having .
other effect he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention
and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene .
the commentary is superb
and has a hypnotic effect ,
again maintaining the focus on the central character in the scene
and there action.i could talk about the effect more
but i think
you all would agree
they push this film into a category of its own ,
and really heighten the drama of the film .
a film
to buy
if you do not own already and one
to see
if you have not.10/10
do not miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film director .
