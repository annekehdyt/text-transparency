while not as bad
as it has been made to be
( i have seen much worse ) ,
this is still a very lame movie .
basically a rehash of siegel 's `` coogan 's bluff '' ,
with the main difference
being that clint eastwood 's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker 
an unappealing actor
if there was one.however ,
venantino venantini is great
( and great fun )
as the bad guy 
sort of a budget vittorio gassman .
he is the main reason
to sit through this steampile ,
as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting 
specially the girl .
poor old rossano brazzi 
hard to believe
he was once a romantic lead
( watch `` mondo cane '' to see him running away from woman ) .
looking here like a second-tier ben gazzara ,
he is given next to nothing to do .
it is all joe don 's show 
unfortunately .
and all of it scored to generic 80 's `` action movie '' music
that could not be more boring.greydon clark
can make good b-movie
( `` without warning '' ) ,
but here he trips 
fall 
eaks his nose
and loses three teeth .
well 
at least the malta location were nice ,
and there is venantini to try to save the day .
3/10 .
