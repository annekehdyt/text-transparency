i watch romantic comedy with some hesitation 
for romantic comedy feature age old clich\u00e9s
which make a movie uninteresting .
typically in a romantic comedy ,
there is a girl
and there is a guy ,
both fall in love 
then have trouble ,
and then win over the trouble
to marry or whatever .
but 
this movie is a different story ,
it is really very different from the romantic comedy i have seen of lately .
there is a widowed guy
( dan ) ,
there is a girl
( marie ) .
dan meet marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime ,
after sometime marie has to leave .
dan develops something for her ,
and when this something starts to turn meaningful ,
we get a twist .
marie is the girlfriend of his other .
unheeded of the circumstance 
dan flirt with marie and realizes
that he loves her ,
and even marie loves him ,
but their love would not just be possible .
how it is made possible form the rest of the story .
steve carell perform well ,
juliette binoche is good as marie .
and every other stuff is done well .
it is a good movie ,
watch it .
