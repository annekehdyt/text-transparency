in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brook .
however 
it is also so bent on being realistic ,
it is sometimes more clinical than entertaining .
recounting the utal killing of a midwest family ,
author truman capote focused on minutia ,
wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subject !
brook depart wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama .
although he films on actual location ,
he keeps his distance .
the murderer are portrayed as depraved imbecile ,
which surely
they were .
they are not seen as misunderstood soul
( as in the capote book )
and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt .
scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killer
as is the supporting cast ,
including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter
( the capote `` character ? '' )
the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall .
