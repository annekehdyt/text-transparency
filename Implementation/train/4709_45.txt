even though this was a made-for-tv production ,
there is absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom result of the finished product .
this movie did have a budget
and it had a casting department 
so ,
if you are going to make a movie about a true life story ,
and actually put `` the true story '' in the title ,
should not some effort be put forward
to try and capture some realism ?
first of all 
this movie is absurdly cast .
these actor belong in daytime television soap 
or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movie ,
and not in a real-life gangster/criminal tale .
everything about them 
from their look to their mannerism 
just screams of the 90's-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening generation .
what about the script ?
two word describes it - stupid and insulting ,
and again it is way too 90ish sounding .
i do not think
the real clyde barrow ever uttered the word `` i am outta here . ''
it is as if a bunch of `` new kid on the block '' fan got together
and decided to make a really `` kewl flick '' about bonnie and clyde 
you know 
one
that would be totally rad and rockin ' .
well 
this sticker does not even rank on the rad and rockin ' scale .
everything that can be wrong with any kind of film
is wrong here 
from the casting and acting to the editing and music .
every single thing is grossly wrong ... .and
it is infuriating
that the party responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve
to put `` the true story '' in the title .
it is certainly not the true story ,
but even worse 
it is not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick
that is accepted on its own term .
like i stated in my heading ,
it is simply horrible beyond word 
on every level imaginable .
trust me on this 
or watch at your own risk .
