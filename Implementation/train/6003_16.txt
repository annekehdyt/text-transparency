this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london
who 
through an unusual set of circumstance ,
discover
they are not english ,
but are an annex of the french province of burgundy.the film feature comic actor stanley holloway
( best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady ) ,
as well as a host of other classic comic actor of the period.the story was apparently based on a news item at the time ,
when the canadian government `` officially '' gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty .
the idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the hutt river province in western australium ,
where a landowner `` seceded '' from the australiumn government due to a wool quota dispute .
( it was never acknowledged by the western australiumn or australiumn government )
.this is a great script
that plays with a lot of political and economic issue ,
rather like the tv show `` yes minister '' ;
as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .
