this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg
( rocket-propelled grenade ) .
it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop .
i half expected beowulf to say exclaim ,
`` i like it !
`` i watched this
because i like chris bruno from `` the dead zone '' tv show
and he did his part .
he chose a strange accent ,
but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie
-- unlike any of his costar .
they kept slipping into all kind of speech from old english to modern english ,
sometimes in the same sentence.there are already many comment
on how this movie is different from the source material .
however 
even on its own 
this movie 's plot is not good .
it is just boring ,
which even the low budget does not excuse .
having a low budget means
that you need to at least
have a good story 
dialog and decent acting .
those thing do not cost much .
instead 
they spent their money on half-assed cgi
and some decent costume and sets.life is too short to watch this movie .
