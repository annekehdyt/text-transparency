like the character in this show ,
i too was a teen during the 70s .
the producer really nailed the whole zeitgeist ,
of being a suburban teenager in the 70s .
the 70s fashion 
car 
home furnishing 
food 
and fad 
are all very authentic in this show.the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast ,
who all mesh together very well on camera .
i really like the unique 
psychedelic-style film sequence .
no other show does camera trick like this .
these cutting-edge film sequence 
really help to convey the campy hipness ,
that characterized the 70s era.overall this is a very funny sitcom .
the one thing
that bothers me about this show ,
is it is over-reliance on cruel humor ,
to generate laugh .
in this way 
i think
that this show tries to be too much like married with child .
while married with child is a great sitcom in its own right ,
it is tacky that the creator
of that 70s show ,
keep trying to imitate it .
i do recommend
that 70s show 
mainly due to it is nostalgia factor .
it could be an even better show though ,
if the writer relied more on witty dialog 
rather than bawdy 
tasteless joke and prank .
