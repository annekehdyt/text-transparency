having seen man behind the sun i guess
i hoped for an evolution in style and technique
to match the larger scale of this movie .
i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocity ,
but this is not it .
this plays like a bottom-to-mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g .
ss experimant camp etc
( perhaps more like deported woman of the special section actually ) .
granted it has a greater scope and more person running around ,
but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lot of hapless non-actor limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshot 
spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock ' sequence .
the admittedly horrible documantary footage is roughly spliced in between scene so hackneyed
that even these real image are robbed of much of their power .
watch channel 4 's 'the holocaust '
( aired recently
( still running ?
) 
as of 1 no 2006 )
for a genuinely disturbing documantary on the evil of war
( featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage ) .
this is the type of treatmant the horror of nanjing deserve 
not this hackneyed exploitation garbage
( a better
executed exploitation movie
minus the disrespectful use of stock footage
would have been fine ,
but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie ) .
rating :
3
( 5 as exploitation 
1 as a treatmant of the subject ) .
