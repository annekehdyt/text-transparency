let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing
to draw attention to themselves in the medium
by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected ,
not to say revered author ,
in order to draw attention to their home-movie out on dvd.hyped to the sky by its obviously talentless maker ,
in fact lied about only to be revealed 
finally ,
as ludicrously inept in every department ,
the fan of well and of his book have been after the blood of its writer-producer-director
since it appeared on dvd.many good point
have been made by the other comment user on this page .
particularly the one
about using this as a teaching aid for film school student ,
since this `` film '' does not even use the basic grammar of scripting 
editing 
continuity 
direction throughout its entire 3 hour running time .
it is possible
the director did show up for the shoot .
certainly there was no-one present
who knew
even remotely what they were doing.an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page
which should at least furnish the watcher of this witless drivel with a few laugh for their $ 9.00 outlay.much was promised .
absolutely nothing was delivered .
except `` monty python meet `` war of the world '' with all the humour taken out.indefensible trash .
just unbelievable.there are real independent film-maker out there
to be checked out .
person
who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gum
about how great their movie is going to be.person
could do worse
than keep an eye on brit film-maker jake west 's `` evil alien '' for example .
