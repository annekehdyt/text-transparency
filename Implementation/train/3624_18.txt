this is a wonderful movie about a othel in a fishing village ,
that could be best described with scene constellation and direction of old kurosawa 's work ,
combined with dostoyevski 's topic of human psychology
( o-shin - sonia marmeladova ) ,
shakespeare 's drama and han christian andersen 's tragic and cheerfulness .
the screenplay is wondrous ,
the scene are colour-
and beautiful some scene stay really imprinted in my mind .
the plot is interesting and unpredictable
- each of the character is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action ,
so if you do not like all the sentiment
you would also come to your cost - .
it is not about mysterious geisha and proud samurai with their bushido
pouring all out of them ,
but about life 
work and kind of person found everywhere at any time .
a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa 
certainly worth seeing .
