oman iv
( 1991 )
was a bad made-for-t.v .
movie .
since the 80 's were over ,
i guess
the executive were experimenting in meth
( the drug of choice during the 90 's )
because there is no other reason
to explain this travesty .
why did they even bother making this ?
a t.v .
movie ?
what were they mulling over
when this one came up on the idea board ?
did they even think for a second
that this movie would catch on as .
perhaps they thought
it could make it as a series ?
we will never know .
but i know one thing .
this movie was the major reason
why i never bought the oman trilogy .
they should have knocked off a couple of buck
instead of putting out this `` extra '' disc.oman iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film .
instead of a snot nosed punk kid ,
we get the spooky girl
who 's a total at to everyone around her .
if the family had stronger parenting skill ,
then none of the demonic event
that have transpired in the past film
would have never occurred .
these parent need to put their foot down
and do some real discipline !
not recommended ,
best to avoid at all cost !
