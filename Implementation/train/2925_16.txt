all internet buzz aside 
this movie was god awful .
i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything .
instead the film maker tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie ,
and they completely missed .
there were only a few good part 
and a couple good line by samuel jackson .
other than that 
it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snake .
all of the internet joking was mile better than the actual movie .
now that the movie has actually come out ,
hopefully this joke will die .
do not waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash .
if you are looking for something
that is funny and entertaining ,
then just go to snake on a blog .
