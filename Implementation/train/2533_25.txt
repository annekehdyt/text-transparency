freeway killer 
is a madman
who shoots person on the freeway
while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone .
the police believe
he is a random killer 
but sunny 
the blond heroine ,
played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern .
so does the ex-cop ,
played by jame russo ,
and they join force ,
and body 
in the search for the villain
who has done away with their spouse .
also starring richard belzer 
this movie has its moment
especially if you like car chase ,
but its really not a good movie for the most part ,
check it out
if you are really bored
and have already seen the hitcher 
joy ride 
or breakdown ,
otherwise stay away from the freeway .
