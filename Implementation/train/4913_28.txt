this movie has everything
you want from an action movie .
explosion 
shootout 
bad guy and worse guy .
it is fun to see jame belushi using his humor
to get out of the trouble
he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollar from the ultimate big boss `` the skipper .
does this sounds cheesy .
of course it is .
but boy 
did i have fun watching this movie .
it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage
that is made nowaday .
if you can get over the silly plot
than you will find out
that this movie has quite a few surprise in store .
you could argue about the twist being predictable .
but the fast pace of this movie does not give you time
too think too much of them ,
which is a blessing since this movie
is not about revealing the ultimate twist .
but more about the journey to that moment .
only the title is a bit misleading
and that could be the reason
why so many person hated this movie .
they probably expected a movie about mobster in stead of some crook double crossing each other .
pure fun !
