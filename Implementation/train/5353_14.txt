i have just watched the movie for the first time .
i wanted to watch it
as i like drew barrymore
and wanted to see one of her early movie .
the movie is about a girl
( played by young and beautiful drew barrymore ) ,
who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss .
short after moving to a guy
who falls in love with her ,
it becomes obvious
that she has an evil twin=doppelganger ,
who haunts her.the movie is quite poor and lousy .
both the dialog and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it .
summing up it is just something for the fan of drew barrymore .
