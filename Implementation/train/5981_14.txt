this a superb self-contained work
that is unconnected with anything before or after .
brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuit of choice ,
but in this law-free world they make an alluring ambiance .
the film is packed with our guy ,
distinctive actor who add distinction to this work with winning performance .
the dialogue is a joy .
in fact it is a new vernacular .
one of the few film
that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation.highpoint
include billy idol 's british loutishness 
ben london 's vulturine assware 
kyle 's squirmishness 
and the survey of ad hoc philosophy .
