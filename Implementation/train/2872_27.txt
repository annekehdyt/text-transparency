i usually enjoy film like this .
it is shot documentary style ,
but the acting and writing are just awful .
the acting is wooden and stiff
and the writing is just so clich\u00e9 ,
but not at all in a good way .
as of typing this 
i am surprised
it is at a 5.2/10 on imdb .
i am certain
that most of these vote must have come from relative of person in the movie .
i suppose
if that is the case ,
you might manage a couple of laugh ,
as it is always funny
seeing your relative/friends make a movie .
well 
in a way 
i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writer 
director 
actor 
etc. 
'cause
if they can do it ,
you can do it .
although 
maybe you should not .
