the most positive thing i can say
for this dull witted local `` comedy '' production is that it is inoffensive .
in fact it is so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozen of re-write by committee
it went through
to have such a complete removal of personality .
it is not witty ,
it is not entertaining ,
it is not insightful ,
and it is not charming .
it is just a staid 
laughless 
progression of four loser
who must change their way - and their attitude towards woman -
to be allowed to attend their best friend 's wedding.with acting
that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatic society 
a plot line
so tired it would make a forty third season of 'allo 'allo look fresh ,
and joke about as humorous as watching decaying vegetable 
sione 's wedding nonetheless scored ten
( yes 10 )
nomination in the nz film award recently.fortunately 
somebody saw sense
and it did not win any .
