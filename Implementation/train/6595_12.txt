my girlfriend picked this one ;
as a southern born
and raised african american i found this movie 's plot and premise totally
without credibility .
to believe
that class and racial bias would be so easily
and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south .
totally absurd ! ! !
i wonder
how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell
( who being southern know better )
to participate in this crap
