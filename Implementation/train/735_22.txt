i just saw `` valentine ''
and i have to say
that it was the best slasher movie
that i have seen in year .
unlike the recent trend of 90 's horror flick 
this movie is more concerned with being eerie
than it is with being self-mocking .
for those out there
that hated `` scream 
'' there is not one reference to `` the horror rule '' in this movie
( even though the old slasher movie rule do apply here ) .
this is the perfect blend of 80 's and 90 's horror .
you get the style 
cinematography 
and good acting of 90 's film and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80 's flick .
i guess
the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movie
they were longing for .
this is definitely a move in the right direction.denise richard stands out here as a fun character .
you can tell she liked her role ,
and that makes her stand out .
i loved her in this movie .
