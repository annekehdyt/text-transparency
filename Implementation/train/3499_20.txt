whoever says
pokemon is stupid can die .
this movie is superlative .
i even shead a tear
when celebei died .
i do not cry much !
this film is a touching animated thriller .
in this fourth installment of pokemon 
ash and friend must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball .
in the time 
sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunter .
i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball
( if you have played pokemon gold 
silver 
or crystal ,
you know
what it is .
) i also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brother .
putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea .
the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever .
