this mini series 
also based on a book by alex haley
as was `queen ' ,
tried to use similar formula ,
that is 
constructing a long history
following the life of a family over many year .
wherea in `queen ' the result was masterful ,
here in mama flora the inspiration was lacking .
firstly perhaps in the book itself ,
and most certainly in this tv production .
too much is put in with too much haste over the year ,
such that the unfolding saga is shallow 
superficial ,
not nearly so authentic as in `queen ' .
full mark for the scenification in the earlier part of the film ,
which was prepared with great care ,
but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hour or so duration .
i had hoped for more ;
but evidently haley was less inspired with this tale than his near-biographical `queen ' ,
and peter werner iii is no match for john erman .
only recommendable for those
who have an appetite for these lengthy tale of generation growing up .
