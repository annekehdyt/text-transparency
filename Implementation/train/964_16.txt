not often have i had the feeling of a movie
it could be visionary .
but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition.we should not tend to be alarmist and see armageddon in something
because it seems to fit our emotion of the moment .
but 
did not we say this of `` 1984 '' ?
had jame orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984 ;
in fact it was in 1994 ;
he might have reconsidered writing his story the way
he did .
hindsight rewarded.it does not matter .
what does matter is that we often regard ourself as superior to our surrounding
but indeed become emotional about a `` love apple ''
when necessity knocks at our door .
a snapshot of ourself at old age.whatever the time-line will prove to be for us ,
i know for a fact we have not seen the beginning of it yet .
