a warning to potential viewer :
if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story `` the most dangerous game 
''
look elsewhere .
`` seven woman for satan ''
only superficially addresses the original work
by using the name of zaroff
and having said
character murder people.some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoiler .
or not.boris zaroff is played by writer/director michel lemoine .
whereas his ancestor hunted man
because they were the only prey
that were truly challenging ,
boris ' victim are usually in a position
where they can not defend themselves .
the film ramble from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity .
the director seems to have totally disregarded pacing
and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film .
a few individual scene are mildly interesting
( such as a torture rack sequence ) ,
but as a unit 
the film fails to entertain .
viewer
who are moreinterested in an assortmant of attractive and semi-attractive actress in various stage of undress
might find the film watchable .
most will probably find their time is better spent watching mantos commercials.in a side note ,
the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film 's history .
apparently 
it was banned for several year in its native france
which pretty much ruined any chance
it had for widespread distribution .
