series three- blackadder the third
`` if you want something done properly ,
kill baldrick
before you start '' hot on the heel of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent 
a vain and stupid foil for blackadder venom ,
played by hugh laurie .
baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw .
the format is similar to the previous show ,
after all now they had found the winning formula
why change thing .
we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious way ,
trying to make bladrick an m.p.or
trying to woe a suitable ide for the prince .
in many way this is one of the most accurate of the series historically ,
the prince regent did take control of the throne during his father bout of madness and some of the character lampooned tell a lot about the time .
samuel johnson 
william pit and wellington all pass through the event
and all manage to steal their scene 
not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
