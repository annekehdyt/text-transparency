ok 
well i rented this movie
while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killer ,
and let me say ,
it did not help the film any.the film is about a man
who buys a car
as he is going through a midlife crisis ,
he loves the car more than anything around him ,
one day his wife decides to borrow the car .
since i do not want to spoil
( not that there was anything to spoil )
i shall let your imagination figure out the `` zany ''
( and i use that word lightly )
antic
that follow.i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film ,
and i would like to say
that
if you are venturing to the movie store
and are thinking about being adventurous ,
please do not ,
it is a waste of the film
it was printed on.then again i could be wrong ...
