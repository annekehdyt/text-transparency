i saw this film at the taos film festival last year ,
and was just overwhelmed by it .
it is a rich ,
warm novel ought to the screen 
beautifully acted 
and well directed .
more than anything 
it reminded me of the film of david lean 
both in its ability
to handle a complex story ,
and its knack
for creating powerful scene
that affect you on several different level .
the best movie i have seen in year .
