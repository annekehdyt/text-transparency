having just watched this film again from a 1998
showing off vh-1 ,
i just had to comment.the first time i saw this film on tv ,
it was about 1981 ,
and i remember taping it off of my mother 's betamax .
it wound up taping in black and white for some reason ,
which gave it a period look
that i grew to like.i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song 
`` my bonnie '' ,
as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool .
i also remember the opening scene
where paul gestures to some girl
and says ,
`` look 
talent ! ''
so it was with great irritation
that i popped in my 1998 taped version and `` remembered ''
that the film opens with `` she loves you '' ,
instead of `` my bonnie '' .
when you see how slowly the camera pans vs. the speed of the music ,
you can see
that
`` she loves you ''
just does not fit .
also 
in this `` later '' version
when paul sees the girl ,
he says ,
`` look 
girl !
`` ..and somehow having remembered the earlier version ,
that word just did not seem to fit 
either .
why they felt
they had to americanize this film for american audience is beyond me .
personally ,
if i am going to watch a film about a british band ,
i want all of the british colloquialism and such
that would be a part of their speech 
mannerism ,
etc.another irritation was how `` choppy '' the editing was for television .
just after stu gets beaten 
for example 
the film cut to a commercial eak-lots of 'em .
yeah 
i know it depends on the network ,
but it really ruins the effect of a film
to have it sliced apart ,
as we all know .
what some person might find as insignifican not in term of dialogue
( and thereby okay to edit ) ,
may actually go the way
of explaining a particular action or scene
that follows.my point is ,
the `` best '' version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981 ,
which just so happened to include the `` shake 
rattle and roll '' scene
that my 1998 version did not .
i started to surmise
that there had to have been two different version made for television ,
and a look at the `` alternate version '' link regarding this film proved me right .
that the american version had some shorter/cut/different scene and/or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth
mentioning
if one cares about such thing .
imo 
one best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film 
if possible ,
and ( probably even less possible ) ,
an unedited version .
sadly 
i had to discard my old betamax european version
because i did not know how to convert it.all
that aside ,
i found this film to be 
perhaps 
one of the best film
regarding the story
behind the `` birth of the beatle '' .
being well aware
that artistic and creative license is often used in movie and tv
when portraying event in history ,
i did not let any discrepancy mar my enjoyment of the film .
sure 
you see the beatle perform song at the cavern
that made me wonder ,
`` did they even write that back then ? ?
i do not think so '' ,
but 
nevertheless 
i thought
it was a great film and the performance 
wonderful.the real stand-out for me 
in fact 
was the actor
who played john 
stephen mackenna .
i just about fell in love with him .
his look 
mannerism 
personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot-on .
he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double-take towards the end of the film
when you see the beatle performing on ed sullivan for the first time .
i actually found myself questioning
whether or not it was actual beatle footage ,
until i saw the other actor in the scene.if you are looking for a dead accurate history of the beatle ' life and beginning ,
you can not get any better than 
`` the beatle ' anthology '' ,
as it was `` written '' by the boy ' 
themselves .
however ,
if you are looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-beatlemania day leading up to their arrival in america
and you leave your anal critical assessment at the door ,
you can not go wrong with the `` birth of the beatle ''
-- a must for any `` real '' or casual beatle fan .
