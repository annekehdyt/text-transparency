okay i had heard little about this film ,
so
when it came on the movie channel on tv ,
i wanted to watch it ,
being a horror aficionado .
i think
i can do a collective `` huh ? ''
for everyone
who watched it.i
decided to move on with my life 
but at a party with my closest friend ,
we saw
it was coming on and some of us
having seen
it already decided we could laugh our way through it ,
both of us proclaiming `` this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen '' .
it was not scary ;
ill give it to roth
( who i think
is a young hack ) ;
character do change throughout the film ,
ala `` cube '' .however despite your typical `` rat in a cage '' scenario-
who will turn on who 
etc. ,
it was pretty average horror.a few point :
1 . )
what was with that kid ?
i am not even talking about him being weird and biting person .
i am talking about the whole `` slow motion karate kicking '' ,
what was that ?
2 . )
okay i know rider 's character liked jordan ladd 's 
but as a young woman 
i was appalled
that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep .
uh 
that illegal.3 . )
roth was in the movie
just so roth could be in the movie .
talk about pointlessly writing yourself in !
4 . )
what was with the deputy ?
5 . )
so she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog ?
and there was little to no blood left ?
just a scrap of her jean ?
anyway we were laughing our ass off 
and i love laughing during horror movie
( return of the living dead 2 
evil dead ) ,
but i do not know
if we were supposed to be laughing here ...
