wow 
the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of house 40 year ago .
i will preface
by saying
i am not a fan of narrated episode .
if the story/actors/etc .
are worth their salt ,
they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative
without having to read it out ,
reminded me of personage who can not think off the cuff but rely on teleprompter .
the psychobabble was tedious and boring ,
but some enjoy
that kind of thing ,
it is just not my cup o tea .
they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting
if it was coming from a psychiatrist
or maybe a newspaper reporter or something .
niggling little thing like peugeot being at the house ,
which has a singular half circle driveway ,
yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree
he was standing under ,
because it is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property .
sloppy editing ,
as she pulls into the driveway
( for what seems the 100th time )
exactly who are those 2 guy
you see at 24m30s walking toward the car
as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house ?
the dolly close-up were also overdone 
like some jr. high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time .
i could keep picking apart ,
but that might get almost as boring as this episode was .
it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed
to be to use absolutely all the stock footage
they had shot of elaine
driving the newport convertible .
i fully expected to see the chrysler logo and a nice jingle play
while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player 
automatic top etc .
the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just end 
auptly .
no loose end tied up ,
nothing explained or terminated .
not that many would notice ,
i suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end .
