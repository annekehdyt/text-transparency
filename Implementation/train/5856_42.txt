joseph h. lewis was one of the finest director of film noir .
this is surely his best.it does not have some of the standard feature
of what we now call film noir .
though american-made 
it is set entirely in england .
it lacks gangster .
it lacks a femme fatale .
it does not lack crime.the title character
answer an ad .
she is overjoyed
that she will be making some money as a secretary .
instead 
she wakes up day later as the pawn in a frightening plot .
only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal .
and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman
as julia.part of the excitement comes from casting against type :
ms. foch has an elegant manner .
she is no screaming 
cowering victim .
she is actually a bit icy and patrician 
albeit impecunious .
this makes her character 's plight all the more believable.surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty .
she was
( and is )
probably most famous for the charming title character in `` the lady vanish . ''
she has a sweet manner and a harmless 
slightly dithering manner .
but here she is far from a heroine.george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son .
the whole cast 
in fact 
is superb.it seems
that this famous and illiant movie was made almost by accident .
undoubtedly the director knew
exactly what he was doing .
but he did it on a low budget .
that is the thrill and charm of film noir 
the real film noir :
it is small 
convincingly lowlife 
and 
in this case 
unforgettable .
