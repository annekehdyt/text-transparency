cybil richard directs another full moon/surrender cinema masterpiece of erotica .
this time jacqualine lovell
( dressed in rather fetching silver outfit )
is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity .
however she can not resist watching the tape
and she kinda like them .
the sex scene are well filmed
and set to a superb soundtrack
( at least for this sort of film ) .
the cast are largely awful
and mainly very average looking too .
jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files
she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below .
she also fits in a little lesbian activity .
to be honest lovell deserves
so much better than this kind of fare .
here she looks great naked
but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the 'drama ' .
utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming feature .
mediocre even for surrender 's output and clearly a new budget low for them also .
