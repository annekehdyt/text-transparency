i saw this in the theater
when it came out ,
and just yesterday i saw it again on cable .
this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling
of just how revolting this film is .
the whole bunch of character are self-absorbed narcisstic preener .
worst of all 
it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating ,
even as it purports to celeate person `` finding themselves '' .
the nice guy finish last 
the jerky guy make out great ,
the jerkiest guy do best .
the girl are all boy toy pushover .
only one character
( `` wendy '' )
is seen doing anything remotely useful to society ,
and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag 
in a lushly filmed scene
that we are supposed to think is romantic .
what this really is is hollywood 's concept of young america :
permissive 
detached 
promiscuous 
conceited .
