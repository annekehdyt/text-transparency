im proud to say
i have seen all three fast and furious film.sure ,
the plot are kinda silly ,
and they might be a little cheesy 
but i love them car chase 
and all the beautiful car 
and the clandestine midnight races.and ill gladly see a fourth one. wan na know
what the difference is between those three and redline ? decent acting ,
somewhat thought out plot ,
even if they are potboiler ,
and last but not least 
director
who have a clue.all three were made by very competent director ,
all of them took the film in a different direction ,
equally exciting.redline look like the producer picked out a dozen woman he slept with on the casting couch 
and made them the extra 
then picked up his lead from hollywood 's unemployment line.and the script.yikes.it mystery science theatre 3000 bad.this is 70 's made for tv movie bad.yeah ,
the movie had a few cool car 
but you do not really get to see that many in action 
and the action is directed so poorly you can not get excited by the chase ,
and if the car are not thrilling you ,
why go to a movie like this ? im in the audience with a bunch of teenager ,
and i can not stop laughing out loud.im getting dirty look ,
but this was just a debacle.rent the fandf movies.go to nascar race.go to a karting track
and race yourself.whatever you do ,
avoid redline like bad cheese .
