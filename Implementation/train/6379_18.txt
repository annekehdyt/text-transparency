i was really horrified by this eerie movie .
what an unusual dark atmosphere .
and such a creepy musical score .
really promising !
indeed 
after ten minute you really start sweating ,
and feeling uncomfortable ,
for you start fearing the worst .
this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare ,
and what is worse-it all comes out .
for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep ,
but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake .
nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eye 
your ears 
your intelligence 
and most of all :
your wallet ,
since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all .
