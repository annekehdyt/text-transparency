i have been wanting to see cut
since the day i have heard of it ,
which was sometime last year .
anyway i got to see today ,
and when the movie started i thought
that it started rather week
but it got better after 10 min or so .
i thought
that the movie was pretty good .
but the thing i did not like was
how the killer was created ,
i was thinking just before i rented
that it would probably suck just like urban legend :
final cut 
i almost died it .
mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved .
cut is 100 time better than ul :
final cut .
the best part of cut is the killer and the death scene .
the killer kicks mo f***ing ass.i give cut a 8/10
