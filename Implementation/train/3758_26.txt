this movie features two of my favorite actor in kilmer and downey .
it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too-small part .
despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable .
michelle monaghan may be pretty
but she is nearly charisma free
and the reason for downey 's character 's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in term of the information
the film present or the way it is portrayed .
the ending seems pretentious
and though the intention seems to be
that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film ,
having failed to ing us in on the side of its protagonist leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.fan of the film
say
that those
who disagree
simply `` do not get it '' .
i do not think this is so .
the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding .
it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured .
i `` got it '' .
i just did not like it .
paddy breathnach 's `` i went down ''
and guy ritchie 's `` snatch '' and `` lock 
stock and two smoking barrel '' are much better realized example of the kind of film-making
that director shane black fails to achieve.i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credit
( mostly as a screenwriter )
makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection .
