there is simply no use
in trying to glorify any part of this film.it
was straight up trash .
at the very beginning you might think
that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography ...
and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack
( burlap )
of fail !
the fighting is barely martial ,
the acting is teetering on the edge of par ,
and the music is not worth describing .
there is only enough of a story
to have created an excuse for this film
to have been made .
the decision
that the character make and the way
that they deal with the situation
is weak ,
and did nothing but frustrate me .
i think
that the only reason this film came about
was to act as a bit of fan service
by using yumiko shaku .
