the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chase
when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discover
that it makes him vanish .
instead of seizing the opportunity
to go spy on a girl mouse
changing room or something ,
he uses his new-found invisibility to torment tom .
and it is pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon .
and the action never leaves the interior of the house ,
which is usually the trait of below average tandj short .
still worth a 7/10.however ,
i am not sure
how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall ,
it defies physic and the very nature of being invisible itself .
