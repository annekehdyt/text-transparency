any story comprises a premise 
character and conflict .
character plotting their own play promises triumph ,
and a militant character readily lends oneself to this .
ardh satya 's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre .
the line goes - `` ek palde mein napunsaktha 
doosre palde mein paurush 
aur teek tarazu ke kaante par 
ardh satya ? `` .
a rough translation - `` the delicate balance of right and wrong
( commonly seen on the bust of blind justice in the court )
has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another .
is the needle on the center a half-truth ?
`` the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant .
it makes a deep impact on the protagonist
and lays the foundation for much of the later event
that follow .
at the end of the film 
om puri ends up
in exactly the same situation
described so aptly in the poem.the film
try mighty hard to do a one-up on the poem .
however 
chitre 's word are too powerful ,
and at best 
the film matches up to the poem in every aspect .
