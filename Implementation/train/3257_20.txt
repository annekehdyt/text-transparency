ride with the devil
directed by ang lee
( crouching tiger )
is another gem in this fine director cap .
for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border war during the american civil war .
see this film and you will visit a sad piece of americana .
besides some superb action scene
( quite bloody at time ) .
this is a story of love and devotion between man and one lady in particular .
it stars toby maguire 
skeet ulrich jeffrey wright and as the young lady jewel ,
i never heard or seen her before ,
i want to see more of her )
.the acting is top notch 
superb production value 
very well written
( adapted from a novel )
this is a long film 128 minute ,
but well worth seeing .
my rating is **** respectively submittedjay harris
