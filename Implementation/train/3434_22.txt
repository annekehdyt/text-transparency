it is only 2 episode into a 5 part drama ,
but i can already state
that this is one of the best thing
i have ever seen .
that is on tv ,
silver screen or even in real life.as a writer ,
it is so good
it is almost demoralising !
as a viewer it is so entertaining
that i am annoyed
the episode are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday .
it is clear that all these negative are actually positives.i am a modern guy
who previously turned over from tv dramas .
in comparison to movie 
tv dramas always seemed to be dated 
quite tame 
and well 
generally boring !
`` five day '' has really ought tv drama into the 21st century 
so for me at least 
it is mind changing .
go watch it .
