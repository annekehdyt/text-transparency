i saw this film last night
( about 102 minute )
and do not know
what kept me in my seat .
i guess
i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen .
the story is a silly excuse
to pile on shot
after shot of bondage and torture .
there is not a character in the film
that does anything like real life .
the cutting `` style '' rely on jump cut 
mini flashback and overprinting
to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadist
apparently running free for year
and surprise the leader is the `` victim '' of an executed killer .
i do not see how gere 
a buddhist 
got involved in this violent 
sexist trash .
