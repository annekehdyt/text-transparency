ok 
forget all the technical inconsisty or the physical impossibility of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold .
forget the hideous special effect and poorly-constructed one-dimensional character .
just looking at the premise of the story .
the very reason for the film to exist in the first place ,
and you will see
just how badly this film was pieced together.i know 9 year old
that look at this insult to the intelligence
and just laugh at it .
the story is horrible .
the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible .
and what worse 
is that the cable movie channel keep showing it !
its on twice a day every two or three day !
why does anyone in their right mind
think
that person would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple time 
much less to see it at all ?
my recomendation is do not even bother spending the energy to watch this thing .
its just not worth it .
