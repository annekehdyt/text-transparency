la teta i la luna
( the breast and the moon )
describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy
named tete
who is obsessed with east growing up in catalunya .
i love this movie
because the character are very honest and very human 
like all the character in bigas luna 's movie
( also director of jamon 
jamon ) .
tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age .
also being from catalunya
( north-east of spain )
it ought lot of memory to my mind .
this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is 
nice person 
nice life and specially lot of non-uptight person .
