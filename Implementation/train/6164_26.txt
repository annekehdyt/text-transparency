`` freddy 's dead '' did the smartest thing
it could have done after the disappointment of the fifth film .
it started from scratch .
sure 
this `` final '' film in the saga is silly
but at least it is original .
some of the visual are even a bit eath-taking .
and the story of freddy 's kid
( lisa zane )
returning to town
to face her evil father
is unique.overall ,
the movie is nothing
but another cartoon made to get kid in the theater .
it has a bunch of good actor
( zane 
yaphet kotto 
and lezlie deane )
who basically look dumb
and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter .
it is one-sided ,
it is a magic-trick ,
and 
in the end 
it is nothing but goofy 
childish entertainment .
