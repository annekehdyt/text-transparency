when someone remakes a classic movie ,
the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original .
also 
there is a chance
that the remake is so radically different
that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.well ,
the 1973 tv version of `` double indemnity '' has almost identical scene and dialogue as the 1944 original .
the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all .
fred macmurray was great as the lecherous 
leering insurance agent walter neff in the original ;
richard crenna just seems world-weary and tired .
edward g. robinson ought great manic energy to his role as macmurray 's boss barton key ;
lee j. cobb 
a fine actor 
appears almost bored with the proceedings .
samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving 
back-stabbing phyllis dietrichson ;
while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role ,
eggar is overly polite and mannered
and just seems way out of place.robert webber 
in the old richard gaine role as robinson 's boss norton 
and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness 
ing some life to the movie .
in particular 
webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context.however ,
after the movie starts ,
the whole thing just sort of ly there ,
without any life or electricity .
this is one film
that never should have been remade .
