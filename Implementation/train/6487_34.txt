this film is just plain horrible .
john ritter doing pratt fall 
75 % of the actor delivering their line
as if they were reading them from cue card 
poor editing 
horrible sound mixing
( dialogue is tough to pick up in place over the background noise ) ,
and a plot
that really goes nowhere .
i did not think
i would ever say this ,
but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film .
there are at least 3 other
that suck more .
pattus hansen deliver her line with the passion of ben stein .
i started to wonder
if she was not dead inside .
even bogdanovich 's kid are awful
( the oldest one is definitely reading her line from a cue card ) .
this movie is seriously horrible .
there is a reason
bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 year later .
please do not watch it .
if you see it in your television listing ,
cancel your cable .
if a friend suggests it to you ,
reconsider your friendship .
if your spouse wants to watch it ,
you are better off finding another soulmate .
i would rather gouge my eye out with lawn dart
than sit through this piece of garbage again .
if i could sum this film up in one word ,
that word would be :
suckotrocity
