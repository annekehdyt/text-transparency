what an awesome movie !
it was very scary 
great acting 
well-written 
nice plot twist 
interesting character 
very good direction 
and a surprise ending
that will leave you with a smile on your face .
this is one popcorn horror flick
that may not be appealing to non-horror fan ,
but is still ( nonetheless )
one of the best thriller out there today !
i highly recommend it to only fan of:1 )
the horror genreor2 )
an actor or actress featured in it .
*** out of **** star ! ps- i am sick and tired of person comparing this 
and other modern horror movie 
with scream .
ya know what 
they did not want to be like scream .
everyone 's like `` oh 
they copied scream ! `` .
well ,
if i am not mistaking ,
scream also copied other movie too !
in fact 
just about every horror movie copied an earlier one .
scream 
however 
was a good film .
but 
still ... stop comparing
and enjoy it for what it is ! go and rent this one !
