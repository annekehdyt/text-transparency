by 1941 columbia was a full-fledged major studio
and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm 
paramount or warner .
that is the best thing
that could be said
about `` adam had four son 
'' a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performance by ingrid bergman
( top-billed for the first time in an american film )
and warner baxter .
bergman plays a frenchwoman
( this was the era
in which hollywood thought
one foreign accent was as good as another )
hired as governess to baxter 's four son
and staying on ( with one interruption
caused by the stock-market crash of 1907 )
until the boy are grown man serving in world war i.
just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good
it is a relief
when susan hayward as the villainess enter midway through \u0097
she is about the only watchable person in the movie
even though she is clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh ;
it is also the first in her long succession of alcoholic role \u0097
but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous .
no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted `` the valley of decision '' four year later .
