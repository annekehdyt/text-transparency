`` written on the wind '' is a dougla sirk 's melodrama .
dougla sirk was rediscovered by the `` cahier du cinema '' ,
fassbinder etc..
that hailed him as a master director -
i think
that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography - `` written on the wind '' offers luscious color image and gorgeous decor .
but i ask myself :
is this enough
to carry a film ?
the acting in `` written on the wind '' range from weak to fair
( excepting robert stack -
he is convincing as the weak and spoiled playboy ) .
lauren bacall 
normally a powerful presence in the screen ,
is miscast in this film .
dorothy malone as the seductress 
the care-free `` femme fatale '' is ok ,
but she lacks the strength for the role .
rock hudson is efficient
but vapid .the plot has very interesting ingredient .
the main character are :
a rigid patriarch his alcoholic son kyle
( robert stack )
( never loved by the disappointed father )
his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee
( dorothy malone )
lucy
( lauren bacall )
- a woman of principle ,
formerly a secretary and now married to kyle mitch
( rock hudson )
- ought up together with kyle
and loved by the patriarch .
secret beyond the door 
a love triangle 
frustration 
fistfight 
laughter 
death etc .
- well ,
when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i
thought
that i was in for a treat .
my mistake !
why ?
i will try to explain :
`` written on the wind '' takes itself seriously and try to tell a dramatic story .
as i said
before the acting 
in general 
is not good enough -
the intensity is lacking .
there are many strong scene in the story ,
but the actor just do an efficient job .
i think
that maybe with italian or spanish actor those scene would have been explored fully -
they would end
( for us )
in an explosion of laughter or tear .what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of dougla sirk .
for me this is not enough .
if you want to enjoy a good melodrama ,
see `` aventurera '' .
