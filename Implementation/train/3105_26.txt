i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddle 
one of my all time favorites ! !
the tv pilot for black bart stunk .
the plot was non-existent
and the acting was not good .
it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddle
and there have been tv show
that have succeeded in doing take-off of big movie ,
but this one would never have worked .
considering that for so many year tv would not even play the farting noise
when they televised the movie ,
it is inconceivable
that they thought
they could put a show on tv with the `` n '' word
thrown around .
on the other hand 
i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces ! ! !
there were quite a few actors/actress
that i recognized from other show over the year .
i had to write down all the name
and do a few search .
that was fun .
i was arguing with my mother
if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash .
i won !
