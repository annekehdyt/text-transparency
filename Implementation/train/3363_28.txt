i really thought
this was not that bad .
not a great work of art
but dermot m was the stronger performer by far .
patricia arquette was overacting much of the time .
he was actually playing cello
which was very impressive ,
and his line were never forced .
besides 
he is an incredibly beautiful man .
really sexy .
add
that to the talent ,
and most anything he is been in is a lot more tolerable .
he always gives his all
even if some of the project he is been involved
in did not quite hit the highest mark.. not the fault of the actor in most case .
he is unfortunately been in some strange film
that just did not resonate at the box office .
always with a-list actor but just not always a `` hit '' .
but he is `` worth every penny '' of any dvd
rented or purchased .
see the wedding date with dea messing - one of his best overall film .
worth every penny !
