i so wanted to believe in this movie
after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.of course ,
it went completely the other way
- let 's be cool and edgy -
and came out the other side with little
to show for it .
i bet
one small seed went nut for this .
i know
sl did.none of the main character have the comedic chop
to pull it off .
even danny k had better timing .
i am actually being serious .
every time they introduced a bit character i
kept thinking 
`` darn ,
this person should have been the lead !
`` .independent does not mean that the camera work need to be horrible .
black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue
it hurt this even more by inging the boredom into sharp relief .
the black and white also was not crisp .
the composition was horrible .
the use of music was horrible .
strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe
that is why the deficiency in this movie stick out in my mind.i think corne
( who was funnier than the lead
before he even said anything )
was speaking to this movie and not david -
see it
and you will understand .
i bet the guy
who organise oppikoppus
were dismayed .
one would think
nothing happens there at all .
i got the feeling
it could have been filmed in someone 's back garden .
i know regular guy
who have much funnier 
raunchier and wittier conversation than any of these `` comic '' .
the dude
who
they hooked up with end
was ok though.guess sa comedy 's gon na stay in the stone age a little longer .
nice work guy .
