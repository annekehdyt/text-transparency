ok i caught this film halfway through 
but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they are.all.reading.from.scripts.especially
that guy
who is now in teacher and the book group ,
although at least he has proved
that he can act
if he wants to !
( the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film
making both in term of acting 
scripting and general plausibility )
it quite clearly appears to be a cash-in on human traffic ,
but whilst
that is not the best film ever ,
it is at least original
and had actor
whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest-yet-hopeless gcse student trying to get a pass grade .
not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash !
