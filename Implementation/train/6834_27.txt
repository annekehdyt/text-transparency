this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me .
it is witty joke
and even it is occasional stereotypical
and derogatory view on eastern european person had me in stitch throughout most of the film .
it is plot is clever and 100 % original
and will have you guessing throughout the entire film .
the one person i was most impressed with in this film
was hilary duff .
it is plain and simple to see
that she has taken a leap of faith
stepped outside of the 'chick-flick ' genre
she is used to .
her accent is excellent
and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed .
it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary ,
and i have seen most of her film .
her character 
yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spear of eastern europe '
and this is seen in some of her mannerism and the song ,
'i want to blow you ... ... ... up ' .
you also feel sorry for her ,
as her performance really grasps you ,
yonica is a very complex and confused character .
joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometime slapstick humour ,
but also her facial expression and so on .
john cusack 's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout .
i strongly recommend this film .
