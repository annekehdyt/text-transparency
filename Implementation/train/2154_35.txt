i have lost count
of just how many time i have seen this movie -
i probably know
the entire dialog backward -
yet i am drawn to it time and again.set in hungary 
a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor `` kralik ''
who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan 's innocent `` klara '' .
kralik secretly becomes klara 's pen-friend ,
and at work together klara confide in kralik about the content of his
( kralik 's ) letter .
clearly kralik is besotted with klara -
but is unable to make his feeling
known whilst he is in competition with the `` pen-friend '' .
confused ?
well you wont be - this story has a sweet 
almost sugary ending -
but we all know
it is the ending
we all want.other character worth mentioning
are frank morgan
playing his usual role 
this time as the shop 's owner `` hugo matuschek '' 
felix bressart as `` pirovitch '' 
kralik 's confidant .
joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant `` vadas '' - so well played
that you can not help but hate him right from the beginning.finally william tracy
who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior `` pepi katona '' .recently re-made
as `` you have got mail ''
starring tom hank and meg ryan for me is not as good as the original -
although i suspect
younger audience would disagree.if this film is on in your area over christmas ,
i suggest
you pour yourself a nice glass of wine ,
put a log on the fire
and have a box of kleenex handy .
