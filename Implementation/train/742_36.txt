one of my favorite film for a number of year was `` last action hero '' ; unfortunately 
arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician ;
so now i can not bear any film
he may had a hand in.the adventure of jake speed actually toys with some theme similar to those in last ... hero ;
so i was pleased to find it on dvd ,
so i could watch these theme played out
so well.despite the `` plot-within-the-plot ''
involving white slavery during an african nation 's civil war ,
this is not an action movie .
the plot
that the `` plot-within-a-plot '' is within ,
is actually about a question
that the film has no intention to resolve :
is jake speed a real person
that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader ;
or is he actually a fictional character
( which means
that the heroine has somehow entered the universe
that really only exists in a series of pulp novel ) ?
i suggest
that this is not all
that clearly defined in the film ,
and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this .
the film thus becomes a presentation of what audience may want from such a fictional `` adventure-story '' universe .
that is actually a rich theme ,
the potential heaviness
of which is lightened by the film 's amiable and campy sense of humor.there
are weaknesses to the film -
primarily it is cinematography ,
which makes the film look like a tv show .
and the pacing does sag on occasion.but i really like these character ,
and i enjoy the adventure
they live 
however silly .
and i just find fascinating the idea
that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel.hold up under multiple viewing -m good show !
