i just want to say
that this production is very one sided 
eaks the impartiality needed
if you want to be taken seriously .
there are no credit of the person
they interviewed ,
so you can not have an idea
if they are worthy of being heard.tell the story from just one point of view .
to do this is very dangerous ,
because the next generation learns the bad idea ,
and that why war keep coming .
i know this is not the only reason about war ,
but does not help either.you can watch this documentary ,
but read in the internet a lot 
before .
balcan are complex
as human history is .
