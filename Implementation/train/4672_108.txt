given the title ,
this first follow-up to quartet
( 1948 )
obviously reduces the number of w. somerset maugham story
which comprise the film .
the author still turns up
to introduce the episode ,
but there \u2019 s no epilogue this time around ;
by the way ,
while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r.c .
sheriff 
here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation 
as well as noel langley
( though it \u2019 s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else
worked in unison ) .
as can be expected ,
much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment \u2013
though this also extends to at least three cast member 
namely naunton wayne 
wilfrid hyde-white and felix aylmer
( the last two had bit part in the episode from quartet
entitled \u201c the colonel \u2019 s lady \u201d ) .
while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor
( slightly unbalanced by the third story
which takes up more than half the running-time ) ,
it \u2019 s still done with the utmost care ,
acted with verve by a stellar cast
and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. \u201c the verger \u201d tell of a church sexton
( jame hayter )
\u2013 for which the story \u2019 s title is another word \u2013
who \u2019 s dismissed after 17 year of service by the new parish priest
( michael hordern )
simply because he \u2019 s illiterate .
rather than rest on his laurel ,
despite his age ,
he not only takes a wife
( his landlady ,
played by kathleen harrison )
but opens a tobacconist shop strategically
placed in a lengthy stretch of road
where no such service is offered \u2013
and 
with business flourishing ,
this is developed into a whole chain .
the last scene 
then 
sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer
who ,
not only is surprised to learn of hayter \u2019 s lack of education ,
but is prompted to ask him what his other interest were \u2013 to which the wealthy
( and respected )
tobacconist reply 
with some measure of irony ,
that he had the calling
to be a verger !
the second episode 
\u201c mr .
know-all \u201d 
is the shortest
but also perhaps the most engaging :
a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man
( nigel patrick ) ,
british despite his foreign-sounding name of kelada ,
who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun .
naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde-white are the two passenger
who have to put up with him the most \u2013 the latter
because he share a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick \u2019 s attention to his pretty wife
( anne crawford ) .
during a fancy-dress party 
however 
the passenger decide to enact their \u2018 revenge \u2019 on kelada
by having one of them impersonate him
( a jest
which he naturally doesn \u2019 t appreciate ) !
; still 
it \u2019 s here
that he contrives to show a decent side to his character \u2013
told by crawford
that the necklace she \u2019 s wearing
is an imitation 
wayne challenge patrick
to name its price\u2026but the latter realizes
immediately
that it \u2019 s the genuine article
and that this would compromise crawford \u2019 s position
if he were to tell ,
so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed
rather than expose the fact
that the woman probably has a secret admirer !
as can also be deduced from the title 
\u201c sanatorium \u201d deal with the myriad patient at such a place \u2013 run by andre ' morell ;
the protagonist is a new intern 
roland culver ,
who wistfully observes the various going-on .
the narrative 
in fact 
highlight in particular three separate strand of plot \u2013 one humorous
( the \u2018 feud \u2019 between two aged scot long resident at the sanatorium ,
played by finlay currie and john laurie ) ,
one melodramatic
( the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife betty ann davy )
and one bittersweet
( the romance between na\u00efve but charming jean simmon and dashing cad michael rennie
which ,
in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact
that morell has diagnosed simmon as a \u2018 lifer \u2019
while rennie only has a few year left to him ,
leads the couple to the altar ) .
