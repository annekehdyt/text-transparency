this movie is so bad
it is good
-- in an unintentionally funny way .
i could not stop watching it ,
i was laughing so much !
it is like a parody of a romantic thriller ,
except it is not a parody .
alexandra paul plays emily wendell 
an oppressed preacher 's wife
who falls hard for luke
( corey sevier ) ,
a hunky and mysterious drifter
who we eventually
learn was in prison ;
the only thing sevier is guilty of 
though 
is bad acting !
mind you 
he is no worse than the other actor .
you get the sense
that the actor have *no* idea
they are in a really awful film ;
they are playing it straight .
everything about the film is bad :
the acting 
the script 
the love scene 
the pacing 
the plot twist 
the choice of music .
the climactic scene are just so ludicrous
-- first the shootout in the church 
then luke 's final word to emily --
i was howling with laughter .
evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunch in prison ,
and we get to see plenty of his naked torso .
that is probably the highlight of the film .
