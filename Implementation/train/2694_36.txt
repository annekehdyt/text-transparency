this is one of the best animated movie i have ever seen in my life .
this is not just a fun movie 
or a well-made movie .
this is a landmark in the art of animation
and
even if it were not ,
just the technical skill
that went into making it ,
would grant it a place in the history of animation.wladyslaw starewicz
created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetle .
he imagined a coherent world of insect 
with job 
house 
nightclub 
movie house 
even little prop like poster and bicycle and paintings.in this movie
he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge .
mr. beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly 
much to the chagrin of a grasshopper ;
but he is a cameraman
and decide to shoot the fling .
mr. beetle returns home
and finds mrs. beetle having her own affair .
mr. beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife .
the two make up
and go out to the movie .
and the movie
they watch
is mr. beetle and the dragonfly .
described thus it sounds banal ,
but once seen
it becomes a gripping work of cinema .
along with emile cohl and jiri trnka 
wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything
that future animator would use in their work .
for that reason he must not remain forgotten .
