dreck about three beautiful woman in california
who go to cover some festival
( or something ) .
all the hotel are booked
so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house .
what they do not know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there
who likes to kill ... yawn .
boring 
pointless 
utterly stupid `` horror '' film .
bach and her two buddy are certainly beautiful
but the movie itself is dull dull dull !
bach and her friend are no actress
-- their faces are blank all the way through .
the final `` revelation '' is laughably predictable
and there is no blood or gore
to keep you interested along the way .
there is some expected gratuitous female nudity
but that is not enough to save this .
boring 
pointless and unknown
( for good reason ) .
a 1 all the way .
