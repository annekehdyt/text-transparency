i just saw the movie in theater .
the movie has very few good point to talk about .
kareena 's beauty and a couple of song may be .
that it .
the movie is a complete disappointment in all area .
anyone
associated with the movie
will
be disappointed ,
even mumbai indian too
( just now chennai has made it to semi-final ) .
but the worst i feel
about the movie is the action scene .
now day bollywood is trying to copy action scene from hollywood .
but they forget
that hollywood director takes a lot effect
to make it look like real .
but unfortunately bollywood director do not have that much of time .
they spend their time on song and publicity of the movie .
now such too stupid action scene may work in south
as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of person .
but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work .
all the action scene i wish
i could have forwarded .
at the end even some chinese person appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar .
this is height of stupidity .
audience is not paying to watch such stupidity .
i think
bollywood now should forget about the action movie .
they can not make it .
the last good action i have seen was from `` ghatak '' and `` khiladiyon ka khialdi '' .
the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fan like me .
does these person see their movie after completion ?
can not they figure out that the slow motion action
( which is done using rope )
is too unrealistic and childish ?
better not to have action scene
if you can not handle it .
i just want to go back to amitabh 's era
where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scene .
the sound effect was not very effective in those day ,
but visually it is much better than current era scene .
this movie now should open the eye of the bollywood movie director .
please do not make any more action movie ,
until you acquire the art
of making it realistic .
