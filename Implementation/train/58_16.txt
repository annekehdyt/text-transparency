a pre-code stunner with stanwyck
playing a speakeasy whore
who sleeps her way to the top .
these pre-code flick really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination .
stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father
who sold more than booze to his patron
( johns )
.after the old man dies
( good ! )
barb head for the big city for better things.she uses her female attribute to sleep her way to the top .
john wayne makes a poor `` cameo ''
and proves
that actor get better with age and an acting coach .
i loved the banter and strong line between the actor .
i highly recommend this film to all film buff and to watch stanwyck
who is great and beautiful as lilly .
