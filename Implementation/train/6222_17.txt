this is not a bad movie ...
but it is the type your girlfriend makes you watch .
the story is not bad ... .
it just makes the hour and a half seem so long .
it is hard for me to trash this movie
because i really do like the idea
of it
but it was just to long and thin on story ... too bad .
the main character never really seems to change all
that much from beginning to end .
i mean goes through something `` life changing ''
and he can barely eak a smile .
i really thought
mac was really good .
his weird quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster .
maybe i just do not `` get '' this film .
if anyone can explain it to me i would love to be informed .
