viewer gushing over everything including the title sequence
( now that is funny )
would have us believe
this is some sort of cinematic miracle 
but 
trust me folk 
this is one of the most embarrassingly bad film
you could ever see ,
and if you are not laughing at it five minute in ,
i would say
you have lost your sense of humor.david niven plays a doomed and avado-besotted raf pilot
who somehow thinks it appropriate
to engage an impressionable
( female )
air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love ,
just as he is plunging to his certain and fiery death .
( is not it romantic ... )
of course 
he is spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance ,
and washes up on the beach ,
just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle .
( they immediately clinch )
.looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts ,
( so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts ,
from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand
playing the movie 's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute 
to a celestial courier
so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the lady ' ) ,
the most bizarre aspect of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricature of national and racial stereotype into a convoluted attempt
to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love .
we get it
-- fly boy like girl in skirt and heel 
and girl like 'em back 
and 
apparently 
all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie
to get 10 star on imdb ... as for the quality of the production ,
the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing ,
and the lighting is 
perhaps 
even worse than that ,
but you hardly have time to notice
because the script is so bad .
there are game played with technicolor ,
( whatever pass for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that ) ,
and foreshadowing ,
( so funny my fellow audience member
who usually like movie like this actually cheered and laughed
when then the doc 's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck ) ,
and freeze-motion ,
( which is funniest of all
because the female lead is so poor at standing
still you know
the stage hand were guffawing off camera )
.the best shot are the early one on the beach 
but 
after that 
it is all downhill .
the
( moving like an escalator is moving )
staircase is hardly the odessa step ,
to say
the least 
and i would really caution anyone from feeling
like they had have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account .
the movie overall is bad enough to be funny ,
and that is about the best thing i can say for it .
