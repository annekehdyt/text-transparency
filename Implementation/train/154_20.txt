it is a very good movie 
not only for the fan of lady death comic ,
but also for those
who like animated movies/series of adventure and fantasy.the film
is about a innocent girl
who is about killed for something
she had not done ,
but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell 
lucifer himself.then
she seeks revenge ...
and the rest you better see it from the movie.i liked the movie a lot ,
the character are like the original comic 
form chaos .
i never had the chance
of read the the first part of the story in comic ,
only the last one 
after the passage in the movie ,
so i can not tell you
if the event are exactly like the comic ,
but ... one way or another it is the story of lady death !
