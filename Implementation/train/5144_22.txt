a not bad
but also not so great heist film .
kirk dougla is a recently released from prison safe-cracker
who ,
after turning down an offer from the mob ,
decides to pull the job himself .
he recruits circus gymnast giuliano gemma .
mayhem ensue .
dougla and gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon romano puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with dougla 's infinitely patient girlfriend
( florinda bolkan ) .
director michele lupo keeps the pace moving quickly
and there is at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence
involving puppo and gemma .
though an italian production 
most of the filming appears to have been done in germany .
dougla is fine ,
not just slumming it in an giallo quickie .
the striking bolkan gives a terrific performance .
the music is by ennio morricone
and the cinematography is by the great tonino delli colli ,
who managed to work with everyone in italy
( from wertmuller and fellini to pasolini and leone ) .
