i do not think
i have ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life
as i was
when i walked out of this piece of crap .
nothing in it makes any sense .
none of it is clever or well thought out .
out of lack of truly suspenseful moment they repeatedly use
that total cop-out trick where you build up the music
before the character
does something like open a door
or push aside a curtain and then nothing 's there .
that ok to do once 
maybe ,
but i counted three time .
there are thing thrown in for no apparent reason 
character 
half-formed story line ... .
the character were not well developed at all .
the ending was.. bad .
bad 
bad 
bad 
everything 
every component 
of this film is terrible .
and i am just here to warn you all of that .
