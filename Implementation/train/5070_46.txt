i should not even review this movie ,
since it is not actually a horror movie
-- and thus not worthy of dr. cheese 's attention .
at least 
it is not horror in the usual sense .
it is certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap .
that is why i turned it off after the first four hour .
imagine my surprise 
then ,
when the clock showed
that only 45 minute had passed .
yep ,
that is right ;
in plain term 
this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. ''
the order '' had lot of flaw 
not all of them unique .
in particular 
it seems to me the main problem with the `` religious '' subgenre of horror film is hollywood 's unwillingness
to engage christianity on its own term .
it is quite possible
to make truly creepy film
that are also orthodox .
just ask william peter blatty .
in fact 
without orthodoxy 
film like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmaker '
( usually dull and illogical )
imaginations.think about it .
if someone made a movie
ostensibly about ,
say 
physic ,
but not only got the basic law of physic wrong ,
but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayal ,
you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot .
the same goes for these sort of movie.in other word ,
`` the order ''
( and many similar movie
before it )
invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these invention .
unsurprisingly 
the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid .
this movie has the added charm
of being as interesting to watch
as your toenail growing.avoid this steaming pile .
