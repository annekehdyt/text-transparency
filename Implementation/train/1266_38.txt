this is a film for entertainmant ;
i did not think
the world made social commantary from one small film .
i personally find this film funny 
audacious 
and memorable .
it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess .
this film was done very
well i might add 
in the 70 's a time of the best experimant in film with being able to mantion a person 's sexuality .
this movie is not about a person
being homosexual or not ,
it is however about love ,
in all it is strange form .
this film does show some of the reality
of being gay in the 70 's in hollywood 
or in california .
pretty boys being looked after
by older not so pretty man .
woman
who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk
not having a career .
bathhouse were an integral part of the gay community.then
the fantasy begins ! !
let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor
and what do we have ?
well this movie ,
which in any way was better than that dismal redo `` the next big thing '' .
perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie
and then try to do better.i enjoyed this movie
when i saw it in the 70 's and it still ings a smile to my lip now .
i heartily advise anyone
who wants a funny 
tender movie- to curl up with some popcorn
and have some fun .
some person need to lighten up ! ! !
and this is the film
you should do it with !
