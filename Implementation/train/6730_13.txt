being a fan of cheesy horror movie ,
i saw this in my video shop
and thought
i would give it a try .
now that i have seen
it i wish it upon no
living soul on the planet .
i get my movie rental for free ,
and i feel
that i did not get my money worth .
i have seen some bad cheesy horror movie in my time ,
hell i am a fan of them ,
but this was just an insult .
