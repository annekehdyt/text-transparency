whoppie .
are we in for a feminist ride or what .
fasten your seat-belt 
lady ,
for we are about to enter a world of mean man and innocent ,
well-intentioned woman.in this soaper trish comes across a guy in the employmant agency
who behaves 
looks ,
and dress like a pimp
( ! )
and gives her a job with the hope of nailing her some time later .
in his office he even touches her chin the way
a megalomaniacal heavy in a bond movie would a touch a girl
just after he is captured her
and just
before he is ready to kill her alongside with bond .
some time later the pimp/employmant guy stalk trish in a lady ' dressing-room 
harasses her ,
and even comes close to raping her .
oh 
these evil 
evil man .
they are all bad ,
do not you know .
you can not even look for a job nowadays
without getting raped 
right lady ?
well 
we will show 'em !
in this film there is some kind of a divorced woman 's club or something ,
headed by a janet leigh
who speaks for all woman
involved in this film
when she says
that `` man are all s**t '' .
she moans about how terrible man are ;
she has been divorced five time .
now 
seriously :
any woman
who marries twenty time
and then uses
that statistic as an argumant
that man are all `` bad ''
must have realized eventually
that the explanation might lie elsewhere 
or ?
it must occur to her that :
a ) she is a bad judge of male character 
or - much more likely - b )
she is the one impossible
to live with - her ex-husband were probably the victim 
or if
they were indeed a**hole
then she probably got what she deserved .
( do not the like of zsa-zsa gabor and liz taylor prove this point ?
show me a likable woman
who got married this often and i
will show you a way
to reach the planet mar
using only roller-skate and a ladder . )
trish eventually meets a computer guy
who restores her faith in man -
but hold your horse ;
this guy turns out to be married ,
therefore proving without a doubt
that man are indeed all `` bad '' .
were it not 
of course 
for a kindly old vegetable seller around the corner
who loves his wife
even though she is still dead -
proving
that all man are `` bad '' except for kindly old man
whose penis do not work
and they `` can not get none '' anyway
so they are forced to abandon a life of a**holocolism
and finally give woman the respect
they deserve .
even the supporting male character are all `` bad '' ;
the black guy in the employmant agency is unfriendly ,
and the guy in the mortuary is out-right rude - and insensitive
( the bastard 
*sob* ... *sniffle* )
and what is with this corny ,
corny ending ? ...
minute before court-time trish abandon the claim to any of her husband 's money ,
realizing
that she is now `` free ''
and that she can finally do
that jump into the swimming pool ... ? ?
what is all that about ? ?
her jump into the pool is then - very predictably - frame-frozen as the credit start
to role in ,
while life-inspiring i-do not-need-revenge-nor-my-husband's-money music starts kicking in .
her girlfriend are shocked by her abandonmant of money claim ,
but they do not stay shocked for long and soon start kidding each other
about what a heart-attack trish 's lawyer will get
when he hears about this .
the shyster lawyer is naturally a man .
an evil 
evil 
terrible `` bad '' man ,
whose only interest in this world is money ... ah 
these man ;
all they care about is money ;
they know nothing of the higher value in life - like shopping .
i am glad we have movie like this ;
they ing the sex closer together ,
but most importantly 
they teach girl and young woman
that man are all horny 
selfish 
skirt-chasing bastard
who will dump you into a world of poverty and misery the first chance
they get .
so 
girl 
open your mouth an stick your tongue into your girlfriend 's mouth .
lesbian power !
