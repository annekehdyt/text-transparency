beautifully photographed and ably acted 
generally ,
but the writing is very slipshod .
there are scene of such unbelievability
that there is no joy in the watching .
the fact
that the young lover has a twin other 
for instance ,
is so contrived
that i groaned out loud .
and the `` emotion-light bulb connection '' seems gimmicky 
too.i do not know 
though .
if you have a few glass of wine
and feel
like relaxing with something
pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scene ,
this is a pretty good movie .
no major effort on the part of the viewer required .
but italian film 
especially italian comedy 
is usually much 
much better than this .
