rich 
alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall .
he marries her and is so happy
he stops drinking .
however 
bacall is secretly loved by stack ' best friend 
rock hudson .
and stack ' nymphomaniac sister 
dorothy malone 
lust after rock .
throw in a few complication
and the movie goes spinning out of control
( in a good way )
.very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw-dropping fashion and furnishing
( check out bacall 's hotel room at the beginning ) .
everybody looks perfect and dress in beautiful 
form-fitting clothe .
basically this is a soap opera with grade a production value .
the story itself is lot of fun
and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top .
the acting by hudson 
stack and bacall is not that good ,
but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially stack ...
when he smiled my knee went weak !
dorothy malone 
on the other hand 
is fantastic
-- she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role .
she is sexy 
violent 
vicious and sympathetic ... all convincingly .
fun 
glossy trash .
do not miss it !
