this is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism
( of heterosexual ) .
the film treats the taboo theme so
that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character .
adrian pasdar is very believable as gerald/geraldine and shall not be forgot for this illant acting .
the directing of christopher monger is very sensitively ,
treating such a difficult issue quite excellently ,
packed into a good story .
not a big movie ,
neither an `` art '' film 
but a little 
lovely motion picture !
