yes i will say
before i start commenting ,
this movie is incredibly underrated.sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell
as is morrissey as dr glass .
he is an analyst sent
in to evaluate her after the death of a sport star .
glass is drawn into a seductive game
that trammel uses
to manipulate his mind.the acting
was good
( apart from thewlis )
stone really has a talent with this role .
she is slick 
naughty and seductive
and does not look a day older
than she did in the first.she really impressed me
( like in casino ) .
morrisey was also good .
he showed much vunerablitity in a role
that needed it .
thewlis however was lame .
he ruined his character
and was over-the-top the whole way .
he really sucked.overall ,
this movie not as good the first
but stone is a hoot to watch .
just ignore thewlis .
