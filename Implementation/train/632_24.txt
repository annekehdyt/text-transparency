generally i like something light and fun ,
so this film should not have appealed to me .
but it grabbed me from the start .
the story of a family 's choice and challenge seem obvious ,
but it raises the question over and over :
`` what if it was my family ?
my choice ? ''
i cried and laughed
when they did
because i really felt
what the person involved felt .
it was in place difficult to watch ,
but more difficult to turn away .
the story is true ,
and life is sometimes difficult to watch !
it shows what film-maker can do without sex 
violence 
or special effect :
a good story is a good story all by itself .
the best and most unpredictable story are all true one .
like real life 
you really do not know what 'll happen next ,
or why person do the thing
that they do !
