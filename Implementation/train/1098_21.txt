this movie is really good .
the plot ,
which works like puzzle force viewer to think and guess ,
what will happen next .
such a trick ings a lot of surprise
and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle .
fighting scene are very good .
there is a lot of different combat style
( although one of style was a bit unreal for me ,
but it is only my opinion )
to watch
and it is fascinating show .
the only thing
which may be irritating
is actor look .
a bit too effeminate
( at least for me ) .
hong kong was always good at kung-fu movie especially in the 70 's and 80 's 
so `` five venom ''
( or other its version )
is great choice .
