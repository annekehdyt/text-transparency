i can not figure al pacino out .
i watch him in the godfather 
scarface 
carlito 's way ,
and i think
i am watching one of the greatest actor of the last thirty year .
then i see him in two for the money ,
any given sunday and revolution ,
and i wonder
what the guy is thinking.i stumbled on revolution a few night ago ,
and thought i would invest the next two hour on this .
here is a news flash :
want to get prisoner to talk ?
force them to watch this over and over ...
they will confess to anything.i will not rehash the plot
since there is no coherent plot ,
but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino play an uneducated peasant
who does not want to get involved ,
but ultimately does .
while he has no money 
no education and dress like a caveman ,
a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason ,
since they have only two minute of dialogue together.quite frankly ,
if `` al smith '' starred in this movie 
instead of `` al pacino '' 
it would have ruined their career .
the script was horrible ,
but pacino 's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse .
donald sutherland 's role was laughable .
i really can not describe it .
natasha kinski is a main character ,
but has like 5 line in the movie .
in fact 
nobody speak much in this movie.one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack
to continually run into each other on the battlefield .
its like the entire northeast is a starbuck .
`` hey 
funny to see you here again ,
on another battlefield 100 mile away ... see you in a few month '' .i am
required to give this one star by imdb ,
since there is nothing here for a negative score .
