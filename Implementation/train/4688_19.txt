very good except for the ending
which was a huge disappointment.the script
was very good
as was the acting .
the visual were often very grainy but this in a way
added to the film
as the snowy feature were in good place
that helped create a mood towards the film .
this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending .
i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten
but the ending knocked it down a point to 7
because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minute of the movie
and seemed quite forced at the end
to make the film maker look clever .
this movie though was much better than film with quite a lot larger budget
and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment .
not much in the way of special effect
as these go
but for suspense it was very good .
