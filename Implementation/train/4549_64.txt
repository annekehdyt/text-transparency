it is very very funny .
you know ,
just like a comedy is supposed to be .
it also looks very very good 
like a hollywood spectacular should .
so 
what more do you want ?
howz about a very very good sally field .
she is so much better here than in anything
else i have ever seen her in ,
and she looks so damn good .
this movie is all you need
to understand
why she is a star .
those eye !
like a silent movie star ,
but better .
in fact 
everyone 's eye are so good .
i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend .
we 'd do that thing
where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner .
they do not do that at all in soap dish .
great .
the eye have it !
( sorry )
there is so many terrific performance ,
its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear .
there is a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly .
got that ?
yeah 
he is damn good .
so is robert downey 
jr.
who has since made sumthin of a career
of playing the slick 
slimy executive .
cathy moriarity ,
while not the most gifted actress ,
is so charismatic and riveting ,
especially when she is angry .
and even whoopi goldberg is decent 
her natural timing
giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing .
ok 
no whoopi bashing 
i hear ya.and then ,
there is the hair .
soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighty ,
so the ridiculous doo are like a great character in themselves .
they get bigger and sillier ,
just like your 's did .
yeah 
we got pictures.soap dish is better than i thought
it would be ,
better that i wanted it to be .
i am sick of movie
that tell me i am supposed to care about shallow 
self centered 
semi-talented egomaniacs 
ie .
tv soap actor .
soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em .
thank you .
