this movie makes me think
the other i have seen with comb
were an accident .
the plot had more hole than i think
i have ever seen in a movie purporting
to be something more than a `` b '' movie .
the acting was so laughable
that not even the memory of comb ' past campy triumphs were enough to save it .
considering the script i have to imagine
that there was not enough money in the budget for thing like continuity and original idea .
i am thoroughly upset
that i paid blockbuster price for this trash .
the fact
that it was made for television
was something
that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something
that movie this poor should be required
to warn you of .
avoid this movie no matter what .
