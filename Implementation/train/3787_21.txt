this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actor were going to do !
the acting was the best ,
farrah should have gotten a oscar for this
she was fabulous .
jame russo was so good i hated him
he was the villain
and played it wonderful .
there are not many movie
that have riveted me as this one .
the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eye farrah
looking like a victim
and you re-lived her horror
as she went through it .
farrah made you feel like you were there
and feeling the same anger
she felt
you wanted her to hurt him ,
yet you also knew
it was the wrong thing to do .
the movie had you on a roller coaster ride
and you went up and down with each scene .
