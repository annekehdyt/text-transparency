this movie makes canadian and brits out to be asinine 
moronic idiot .
the man get stoned/drunk ,
and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene .
the woman are superfluous to the story \u0096 i do not understand
what they are there for \u0096 they spend every scene
causing a ruckus 
or worse ,
milling around like mesmerized cattle .
apparently 
canadian woman are either quarrelsome vulgar tramp or hulking hippie chick .
it is the standard knocked-up girlfriend 
her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness
that we have seen in countless movie before.every character here
is a carping 
infantile stereotype .
not to mantion that
they all looked like
they need a shower !
and the idea of any kind of scene
implying sex with george wendt \u0096 shudder \u0096 is enough
to make anyone gag !
i watched the movie
because samuel west was in it \u0096
but i can not understand
why he would have accepted a role like this .
maybe he needed the money .
ian tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming momant ,
but his talent is wasted here.as for the rest of the plot \u0096
the three imbecile trying to get their dope back \u0096 yawn - or karl \u0096
who is dead ,
but who is actually a character very much alive in the mind of those left behind
( almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock 's masterpiece \u0096 although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two film ) ,
why even bother ?
karl is so galling
that you find the circumstance of his death gratifying.by the end of this wretched movie ,
i thought
they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat !
