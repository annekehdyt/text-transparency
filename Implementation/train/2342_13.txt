even steve martin and dan aykroyd could not save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg .
based on the classic phil silver tv series ,
it bombed because :
a )
it was updated to the 1990s 
and b )
the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing 
feeble and silly screenplay.the original tv series used a small cast of talented actor to portray lovable character
acting out simple yet hilarious prank .
to expand this premise into a 1990s movie
was asking for trouble ,
and it shows .
no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time .
