whatever the merit of the film ,
it is poorly researched .
as other have pointed out ,
the movie shows local in iran speaking in arabic 
rather than persian .
that is enough to lose credibility for anyone
who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country .
the landscape could not be more different from the actual.other factual error :
a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan ,
while afghanistan does not have railway .
the turkish ambassador is wearing a fez
( the red hat ) ,
whereas the fez was banned by turkey much before the time
in which the movie is set .
the turkish ambassador 's daughter is actually dressed as an indian ,
and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scene .
i suppose the filmmaker meant to show an exotic woman ,
and sari was what they decided would make her exotic .
