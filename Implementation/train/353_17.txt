while exploring some cave with his wife ,
a doctor is bitten by a bat
which causes some alarming side effect ... occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent
( though under used ) makeup effect do not save this b horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature .
the bat person aka
it lives by night suffer from its senseless story
that is awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing .
the plot never seems to go anywhere much
and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens 
or even a satisfying conclusion
for it all .
the cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.still i give the film some point for its haunting theme song and nice filming location .
the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too ,
but it does not get much of a showcase here .
a missed opportunity for sure .
definitely one of the lesser man-creature flick out there .
* 1/2 out of ****
