'presque rien ' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experience of a young french homosexual .
eschewing both stereotype and preaching ,
it is a wonderfully naturalistic film ,
superbly acted ,
shot with a feel for the seaside town
where the action takes place ,
never melodramatic but often painfully real .
if anything it is almost too realistic ,
as there is little in the way of conventional plot ,
just scene from a life .
but the absence of conventional dramatic tension count for less
than it might in a world
so subtly drawn .
'presque rien ' might not be the most exciting film ever made ;
but its simple humanism serves it well
compared with the pre-conceived celeatory or bigoted viewpoint
that often mar treatment of this theme .
worth a watch .
