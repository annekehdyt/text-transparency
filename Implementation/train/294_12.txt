this film is predictable ;
it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass ,
when he huts the ball for the jet .
one saw
the ending coming up halfway through the film .
the politic reminds me
when i was back east .
many person know
when the fix is in .
i gave this four
because of the acting ,
but the story is lame .
