this movie surprised me in a good way .
from the box i got the impression
that it was an action thriller
but it was too funny to be a thriller ,
even though it was somewhat exciting.there is a lot of nice one-liner and funny situation in this movie and jame belushi was born
to do bill manucci ,
he does a great job .
the rest of the cast are not half-bad
either and especially timothy dalton is a treat.the story
can get pretty confusing at time
as new character shows up during the film .
thing get more complicated
as nobody seldom tells the truth about thing .
if you do not pay attention thing might get a bit messy in the end
but i really liked it.louis morneau is not all that well
known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i
never really grew impatient
while watching the movie.made man is well worth checking out .
