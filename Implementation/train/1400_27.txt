how come i have never seen or even heard about this junk-movie before ?
it is right up my alley with bloody teenkill 
laughable plotting and an irresistible 80 's cheese-atmosphere
hanging around it .
for some reason nobody is really interested in ,
the staff and student of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath .
freshly recruited teacher julie parker becomes involved
when all the person she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely .
this movie is hilariously bad !
there is absolutely no logic or coherence
and every character is equally meaningless to the other .
for example 
there is a girl killed
and her body dumped in a container .
then 
and for no reason 
the story suddenly moves forward three week yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed .
not even by her boyfriend !
the acting is pitiful
and there is not even a bit of nudity
to enjoy .
the revelation of the killer is quite funny
because the maker really seemed convinced
that it was an original twist ...
it is not 
guy !
`` splatter university '' is easily one of the worst horror-turkeys ever .
