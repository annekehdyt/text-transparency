`` amazing grace '' has a languid feel
to it
as it tells a contemporary story of various life in an apartment building .
the language spoken is heew ,
but the drama could take place in any modern city .
it observes family value 
romantic relationship 
and age group characteristic with equal aplomb .
it does not judge the character ,
only present them in a straight forward manner ,
as they strive to work out their individual problem in this modern world .
the quality of acting is very good ,
and the observation made on the character are astute and sharp .
i appreciate this flowing film very much .
