well 
i am delighted to hear a rumor
that this may finally be issued on dvd .
when that will happen ,
i do not know ,
but i will grab it
when it is released.in my humble opinion ,
this is errol flynn 's most entertaining film ,
especially when `` gentleman jim '' corbett 's ring career begins in the film .
then it goes from a good film to a great one.few person
could play arrogant man
and still come off as a likable good guy as well
as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that .
reportedly 
this was flynn 's favorite role and i believe that .
you can just sense how much fun he was having here .
ward bond also looks
like he was really enjoying his role
playing the famous john l. sullivan .
bond 
too 
was never better.there is just the right amount of action boxing scene in here
and they are pretty well done 
too .
corbett 's family is fun to watch 
too ,
as they carry on in the stand during jim 's match .
out of the arena 
corbett 's family 's constant argumants
and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying
but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.and
speaking of the conclusion 
sullivan 's speech to corbett
after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film .
some mean-spirited critic
( variety 
for example )
did not like that ending nor the fact
that much of the film is fictionalized
but - duh - most film
are fictionalized ,
like it or not .
and 
in this case 
it made for a nice story and nice ending .
( in real life 
corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman ,
not anything like flynn 's portrayal ,
but flynn still make him a good guy .
) this is one of the more entertaining classic film i
have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd .
