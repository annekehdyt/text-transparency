this would have worked a lot better
if it had been made as `` mitchell in malta . ''
at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker
running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit ...
not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger .
mitchell being mitchell ,
the film would not have suffered from a lack of gratuitous polouse utality either .
oh well .
at least the comic comment of mike and the bot made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst .
i can not imagine watching it on it is own 
however .
