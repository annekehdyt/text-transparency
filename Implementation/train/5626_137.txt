'the hill eye ii ' 
one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequel
to come around in some time ,
is 90 minute of incompetent film
making at its finest .
or worst 
however you choose to look at it .
while 2006 's 'hill ' remake was one of the year 's best ,
and truly frightening 
horror film 
this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment .
part 2 never gets off the ground ,
and neither does its mind numbing dialogue .
worst of all 
it is not that scary.2006 's remake followed a family
who find themselves in the middle of the new mexico desert 
deserted ,
and one by one
being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill person .
person
who ,
as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land year ago ,
have become who they are .
surviving off traveler
who wander into the region .
the sequel puts audience in the same desert ,
now occupied by the military
as they covertly investigate the hill
and what might have happened to that poor family .
when a group of military trainee are ought to the campsite ,
they find it deserted with no sign of life .
a grim reality soon befalls them ,
as they come to the realization
that they are not alone .
and the bloody fate
that was handed to many
before them will soon become their destiny.it does
not take a genius
to realize
that 'hill ' has no legitimate reason to exist .
but because last year 's remake was received well both at the box office and by critic ,
it came to no surprise
that a sequel would be rushed into production
while there is still money to be earned .
there is no rhyme or reason
to it this time around ,
just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up
to pave the way for thoughtless character 
unoriginal killing 
a non-existent story 
and slipping interest .
originally 
director alexander aja made craven 's cult classic into a remake
that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience .
one
that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasion .
its frank display of violence 
sadistic torture 
well-rounded characterization 
and white-knuckled suspense were all effectively
used to shock and repulse audience .
the second time around 
it is rehashed hand-me-down .
there is no style 
no grit .
it tries to build up tension by dismembering body ,
when all it really does is make for a been there ,
done that kind film ,
where even the gore seems tame
compared to more recent bloodbaths.it
is a sad state of affair when deformed mutant
who capture woman for eeding purpose fails
to keep your attention .
it is a bore 
nothing more .
'hill ' has no bite .
despite a jump or two here and there ,
there is nothing very scary about this by-the-number horror flick .
it feels like something
you would see on the sci-fi channel 
only with some f-bomb 
a blood splatter here and there 
a rape 
and a graphic birth scene
that is more gross than shocking .
it is cheap .
and with 'hill ' 
you reap what you sew .
with no effort given 
you can not expect anything in return.replacing aja with martin weisz
as director was the film 's first big mistake ,
all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance .
but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script
penned by wes craven and his son 
jonathan craven .
you ask 
how bad could it possibly be ?
this is the kind of dialogue
that makes any comparison look like shakespeare .
craven has had his fair share of clunker in the past ,
but i would never expect something like this from him .
it is so unintentionally funny ,
you have to wonder ,
is craven playing a joke on this ?
or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off ?
the film 's character are one-dimensional talking head with no emotion or common sense .
the acting is just as bad .
the only character
who may win you over is 'napoleon ' napoli 
the scrawny kid
who does not fit in with the other .
even the deranged and instinct-driven villain ,
who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thought a year ago ,
are met with indifferent .
you do not hate them ,
you do not like them .
you honestly could not care less .
just like this movie.even
if you were giddy with fear during 'the hill
have eye ' ,
as i was ,
you will have a tough time
finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage .
it is as generic as generic gets ,
and there is absolutely nothing here
we have not seen done many time already .
i can not express this enough ,
avoid 'the hill have eye ii ' like the plague .
it is frightless 
unoriginal 
frantic 
and a bore .
stick to the remake or craven 's original vision .
because
if you do not walk out after the first thirty minute ,
do not say
i did not warn you .
