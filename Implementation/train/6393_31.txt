for muslim woman in western africa 
married life at the hand of abusive husband can be very hard .
the community may not explicitly endorse such behavimy 
but equally ,
they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal 
an attitude
which of course enable it to continue .
fortunately 
the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all ,
and this documentary follows the real life exploit of various female practitioner in the cameroonian legal system
as they attempt to secure justice for a number of woman and child .
what is notable
( apart from the uplifting central story )
is how 
in spite of their informality 
the court are actually pragmatically progressive ,
if a case is actually bought .
the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life-style ,
which
( aside from the awful crime
committed in the featured case )
seems amazingly emotional and joyous
compared with that enjoyed by inhabitant of europe or north america .
and while i concede
that this comment may betray naivet\u00e9 on my part ,
this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin-english
they speak .
overall 
this is a terrific little film ,
and much more fun to watch
than you might imagine .
