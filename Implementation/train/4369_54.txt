as a child i preferred the first care bear movie
since this one seemed so dark .
i always sat down
and watched the first one .
as i got older i learned
to prefer this one .
what i do think is that this film is too dark for infant ,
but
as you get older
you learn to treasure it
since you understand it more ,
it does not seem as dark
as it was back
when you were a child.this movie ,
in my opinion 
is better than the first one ,
everything is so much deeper .
it may contradict the first movie
but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one .
the cubs are just too adorable 
i rewind
that 'flying my color ' scene .
i tend to annoy everyone
by singing it.the sound track is great !
a big hand to carol and dean park .
i love every song in this movie ,
i have downloaded them all
and is all i am
listening to ,
i am listening to 'our beginning '
also known as 'recalling ' at the moment .
i have always preferred this sound track to the first one ,
although i just totally love carol king song in the first movie 'care-a-lot'.i
think
the animation is great ,
the animation in both movie are fantastic .
i was surprised
when i sat down
and watched it about 10 year later
and saw
that the animation for the time was excellent .
it was really surprising.there is not a lot of back up from other person
to say
that this movie is great ,
but it is .
i do not think it is weird/strange .
i think
it is a wonderful movie.basically ,
this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon 
dark heart .
the end is surprising and again 
beats any 'pokemon movie ' with the care bears moral issue .
it leaves an effect on you .
again this movie can teach everyone at all age about morality .
