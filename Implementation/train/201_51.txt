rob este 
josie bisset and a crap load of kid
that look nothing like either of them.basically ,
rob and josie
have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation .
they each come home
to find
that their respective child already know of the nuptial due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder .
they 
rob and josie 
move both of them and their eight kid into one or the other 's house.rob builds furniture ,
i think ,
which is close enough to frank lambert 's
( patrick duffy )
construction job on the much similar step
by step
to warrant eternal mockage.josie
is some sort of cookie-making queen ,
though it does not look like she makes any of the cookie .
not close enough to carol foster 's
( suzanne somer )
hairdressing job
to warrant likeness mockage ,
but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage.unlike step by step ,
they were a couple before the vacation
and actually knew one another 's last name ,
or so one assume
if their serious enough about a relationship
to take a trip together.anyhow 
there are eight kid ; moira 
sandy 
jeff 
lily 
daisy 
nathan 
andrew l. and andrew b. i 
personally 
think
they should have just called the younger andrew 'andy'.there is a lot of product placement 
particularly for soup at hand
( which is disgusting )
and listerine pocket pack .
there are also some stupid 
senseless moment .
it is also not a great film
to promote happy families.but 
hey !
rob este !
this concludes my review of 'step by step ... on some really bad drug . '
watch it for rob este and his pretty ! eye .
there are some great pretty ! eye shot .
