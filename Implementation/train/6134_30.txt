the head of a common new york family 
jane gail
( as mary barton ) ,
works with her younger sister ethel grandin
( as loma barton )
at `` smyrner 's candy store '' .
after ms. grandin is abducted by dealer in the buying
and selling of woman as prostituted slave 
ms. gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore
( as larry burke )
must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman .
`` traffic in souls '' has a reputation
that is difficult to support -
it is not remarkably well done ,
and it does not show anything very unique
in having a young woman 's `` virtue '' threatened by sex trader .
perhaps 
it can be supported as a film
which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length
( claimed to have been ten reel 
originally ) .
the new york city location scene are the main attraction ,
after all these year .
the panning of the prisoner behind bar is memorable ,
because nothing else seems able to make the camera move .
