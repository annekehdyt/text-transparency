i remember seeing this film
when it first came out in 1982
and loved it then .
about 4 year later i had the privilege
of seeing luciano pavarottus sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york
( in tosca )
so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night .
what is not to like about this film ?
the music is illiant and pavarottus
( fini )
was at his best
and still looked great .
the story is actually very funny in part and the 'food fight ' scene is still one of the funniest i
have ever seen .
the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful
and so was the song
he sang
`` if we were in love ''
( one of the few time pavarottus sang in english ) .
and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous .
get real folk ,
this was a film about an opera singer
called georgio fini
who just happened to be played by pavarottus .
kathryn harrold and eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles.i am very glad
that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie
but i would love this to be released on dvd especially
now that pavarottus is no longer with us
because i think
this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today !
