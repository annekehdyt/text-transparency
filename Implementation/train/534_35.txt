hole
( 2003 
dir andrew davis )
when stanley yelnat iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing ,
he is sent to 'camp green lake ' .
at this camp 
the warden 
and her two henchman 
mr. sir and dr. pendanski command the campmate to dig hole after hole after hole .
but for what reason ?
stanley plan
to find out.i
never really had any intention in watching 'hole ' ,
and i must admit ,
i only really watched the film ,
because i am such a fan of shia labeouf ,
but even if you are not a fan of him ,
then it does not matter .
'hole ' is one of those disney film
that the whole family can enjoy .
the story is lovely written
and incorporates a wonderful idea
of including flashback to the past .
these are not distracting
and really gives a great back story .
all the cast are great .
the young star act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy .
shia labeouf shows
that even at 17 
he can act without any flaw .
this is one disney film ,
you definitely would enjoy as a family .
`` i learn from failure . ''
