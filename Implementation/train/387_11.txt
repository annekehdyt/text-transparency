an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequence for many .
well filmed and acted
even though the story is a bit forced ,
yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion .
the feeling
of being lost in the big city
is effectively conveyed .
the little person
lost in the big society
is something to which we can all relate ,
but i can not endorse going out of your way to see this movie .
