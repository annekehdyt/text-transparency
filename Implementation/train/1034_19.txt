reading through all these positive review i find myself baffled .
how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel ?
there are many problem with the film ,
already mentioned in a few review ;
simply put
it is a hammed-up 
over-acted 
chintzy mess from opening credit to butchered ending.while many character
are mis-cast
and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance
that is worthy of them 
the worst by far is paltrow .
i have very much enjoyed her performance in some role ,
but here she is abominable -
she is self-conscious 
nasal 
slouching and entirely disconnected from her character and those around her .
an extremely disappointing effort -
though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film .
