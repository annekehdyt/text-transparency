terry west had a good idea w\\ this movie .
he just did not flesh it thru .
there are endless shot of the creepy looking school 's exterior
that go on forever
and probably to pad the film 's running time .
also at this school there are only 2 student .
misty mundae is good
as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca
( which is the only reason
to watch the film in the beginning ) .
if the script centered on her interesting character
we 'd have a movie to watch .
she is so gorgeous ! !
good news for dvd buyer 
terry west 's earlier
( and better )
film `` blood for the muse '' is a special feature .
one thing i would like to say
is that this movie feel like someone
who 's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feel
that very same way .
then again 
just watch this for ruby larocca .
