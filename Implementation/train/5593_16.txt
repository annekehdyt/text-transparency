ok 
my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minute into the movie ,
we 'd exchanged a lot of `` ehhh ,
what is this movie about and more importantly 
do i care to find out what it ends with '' glance
and decided we either needed drug
to keep us interested in the `` plot ''
or just end the pain right there and then
and watch something else .
we opted for the latter.i liked `` but i am a cheerleader '' a lot ,
but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste 
sorry !
i definitely prefer `` d.e.b.s '' 
`` better than chocolate '' 
`` fucking \u00e5m\u00e5l '' 
`` goldfish memory '' and `` fire '' .-sorcia
