it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user
that anyone
who might see `` the medusa touch ''
should be warned about a scene
that is eerily reminiscent of the sept. 11 
2001 terrorist attack in nyc .
but i hope
anyone reading this will consider this warning .
despite an interesting pedigree
( producer elliott kastner
produced `` harper '' and `` the long goodbye '' ;
co-producer arnon milchan co-produced the oscar-nominated `` l.a. confidential ''
and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for `` gandhi '' )
and an international cast 
i found `` the medusa touch ''
to be a heavy-handed 
unintentional laugh riot .
it was a poorly directed 
horribly written and acted mess .
it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thriller genre .
the movie fails on many count .
please consider `` carrie '' and the underrated `` the fury ''
( both directed by brian depalma ) .
they were two entertaining and exciting thriller
that dealt with the same subject matter .
