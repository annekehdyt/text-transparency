this film captured my heart from the very beginning ,
when hearing quincy jone ' first note or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flower in the meadow .
this is truly a film to cry and die for ... !
the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i
have seen in year
and spielberg has really outdone himself !
whoppi goldberg 
margaret avery 
oprah winfrey
( oh lord !
) 
danny glover 
and the other 
all give us their best
and you can feel
it - almost touch it !
goldberg is celie ,
she gives her
that insecurity and feeling of inferiority
that is needed for the character ,
and we grow with her ,
we grow strong together with her 
throughout the movie ,
and we triumph with her .
margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery ,
even when she is at her most arrogant ,
and shows us
that `` sinner '' 
indeed 
`` have soul too '' .
the always sympathetic 
charming danny glover makes a marvellous job
at making person
hate him and the magnificent music
of ( i would say sir )
quincy jone adds even more beauty to this splendid film !
the photography 
the music 
the director and the music makes this beautiful ,
soulful movie into an experience of life .
you do not want to miss it !
`` sista ' ... remember my name ... ''
