presenting lily mar is one of a genre of film
that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system .
ok now
that you know my bias ,
here are some reason i think
this movie does stand out.1 .
although the basic plot - lily mar
( judy garland )
goes to new york 
becomes a star ,
and wins the heart of her director
( van heflin )
is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period ,
the writer do vary the theme her a bit more than usual .
although lily gets her big eak
when the star quit 
she is not successful
and has to swallow her pride
and go back to playing a minor role in the show.2 .
judy garland
( enough said ! )
3 .
the supporting cast includes some really great performance .
spring byington as lily 's mother is truely wonderful ,
as is fay bainter
( the mother of the director - john thornway
( van heflin ) ) .
the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie ,
a one time actress turned theater custodian.worth a watch for sure .
one of those movie
that are designed
to make you
feel better about the world and your dream .
