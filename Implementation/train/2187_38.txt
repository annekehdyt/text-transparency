shecky 
is a god damned legend ,
make no mistake .
until recently i worked for a uk hifi and video retail chain ,
running their testing department .
we would go through many new starter ,
they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus
that returns as non functional in one way or another from the store .
now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff member ,
we would issue them with a copy of going overboard .
we had hundred of copy of this film
because whenever someone
who had bought a particular model of goodman dvd player
that had this film as a free gift ,
got round
to sending their dvd player back ,
they never failed to send shecky back also .
our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machine for fault
until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.now ,
as to why this film is so bad ,
where do i begin ? adam sandler ,
who can be so ,
so very funny ,
as in happy gilmore 
or the wedding singer ,
must have been having one hell of an off day .
the rest of the crew stank ,
and what is it with billy zane ?
his name crops up in several of the worst movie of all time ,
and he is a decent actor .
crazy .
the production quality is absolute zero.i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could ,
because they did not even have the gut to call it
by it is full name 'the unsinkable shecky moskowitz ' on release .
even so it is worth a watch
so you can see
just how far sandler has come ,
and just how low he can go .
