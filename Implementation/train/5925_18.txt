remember
when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood
because he made great movie ?
those day are feeling
like a more and more distant memory.while `` hollywood homicide '' is by no mean terrible ,
it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie .
it is a comedy
that is not particularly funny ,
and an action movie
that is not especially exciting .
an overabundance of subplot can not mask the weakest of the central storyline.ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few project ,
and he is able to carry the film most of the time .
hartnett is adequate ,
but he and ford are not exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concerned.all in all ,
`` hollywood homicide '' is a reasonably amusing diversion ,
but just barely .
take out ford ,
and it is not even that .
