the jist :
see something else.this film was highly rated by gene siskel ,
but after watching it i can not figure out why .
the film is definitely original and different .
it even has interesting dialogue at time 
some cool moment 
and a creepy `` noir '' feel .
but it just is not entertaining .
it also does not make a whole lot of sense 
in plot but especially in character motivation .
i do not know anyone
that behaves like these character do.this is a difficult movie
to take on --
i suggest
you do not accept the challenge .
