i am a black man
living in a predominantly black city .
that being said ,
i have some major misgiving about tyler perry 's work .
i realize
that some person out there feel the need to praise him ,
because he is black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture .
but 
i honestly do believe
that ,
were perry white ,
this film would have had the naacp 
al sharpton ,
and jessie jackson all over his ass.i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently
and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil .
the character are poorly written and acted .
the joke are so bad ,
i have to actually be told something
is supposed to be funny .
i am just going to eak this big pile of sh-t down.madea=suck .
the character may have had some appeal ,
but it does not anymore .
when the only thing
she ever seems to do
is smack around child and threaten adult with violence
she is less than useless .
she is unnecessary.the situation with the wife beating fianc\u00e9 was horsesh-t.
if a woman was so scared to death of her husband ,
why would she try to run away
when he is sleeping in bed .
would not it have made more sense for her to leave
when he was at work .
at any rate 
the character in this arc were so annoying and overbearing
that i hoped
he would throw her off the balcony
and was royally ticked
when he did not.then there are the two lovebird .
a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her
while he is making his round .
i could not believe it .
i really could not believe
when she agreed to go out with him even more .
but 
what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebble at a window
and passing note like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch .
i do not use this term lightly ,
but that woman only had two mode .
morose victim and psycho momma .
no matter which of these two faces
she showed 
however ,
there was one constant .
the bus driver was not going to get any .
he even married her without sampling the good
-- wtf !
then there is the family reunion scene .
here we have got the mother load
which includes implied incestual taboos ,
grinding for the sake of grinding 
shirtless 
overly musclebound 
b-ball 
plus the great taste of maya angelou .
when those babe dragged their butts outside
and called a meeting ,
was i wrong to wish
that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack .
all this crap is going on at the reunion 
in laughably easy to separate group ,
and then they ring a bell .
when they do ,
everyone drops
what they are doing and head on over for a stern talking too 
just like a pack of pavlov 's doggie
-- wtf ! !
then you have the final five minute of the film .
in it we see the abusive fianc\u00e9 get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress .
there is an impromptu wedding
where black person are dressed like angel
and are hanging from the ceiling
-- wtf ! ! !
the only reason
to watch it this far ,
besides testing your threshold for pain ,
is the hope
that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well .
guess what ,
it does not happen .
instead 
perry takes the testicularly challenged way out
and plays it safe ,
ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness
-- wtf ! !
i am pretty sure
that ,
if given a day ,
i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the way this movie sucks .
do not even get me started on the rest of tyler perry 's film .
i am just going to say this .
in my opinion 
as a black guy 
d.w. griffith 's legacy lives on .
the irony is
that it is doing so through a black man
who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did ,
selling us down the river .
i only wish
perry 's film were dude
so i could kick them in the nut .
thank a lot 
dude ! !
what are you going to follow this up with in 2009 
a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slave in colonial america ?
