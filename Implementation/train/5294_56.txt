be warned .
this movie is such a mess .
it is a catastrophe .
do not waste your time with this one .
i warned you ! the acting ,
story 
dialogue 
music ... basically everything is so over the top ,
it is absolutely annoying and ridiculous .
it made me want to throw up
( if the dialogue/acting/story was not doing it ,
it is everyone being shot crooked ) .
you will feel
like you are watching a comedy .
the problem is 
the part
that are supposedly funny
is not even funny .
the acting 
story 
cinematography 
you can feel
everything is just trying waaaay too hard
-- but it never succeeds .
practically every shot is can noted 
but so what ? !
this movie just feel like a student film .
no wonder they shot this in hd
because it would be a waste
to spend more money
to shoot this on film.if
you are easily amused or like poor acting 
writing 
editing 
directing 
full of clich\u00e9s 
everything
that is forced in your face ,
oh and did i mention poor acting ?
( well 
actually 
it is not all the actor 's fault -
it is the director ! )
then i guess
you will like this movie.i had to watch this for a class .
i would have turned it off right away
if i could .
if you still can not tell by now 
i hated this movie .
it made me want to throw up
and get my time back ...
at least i did not have to pay for this garbage.jeff goldblum ,
you know ... the guy from jurassic park/independence day ,
is in this movie
but he sure went downhill from then
-- accepting role for movie like this catastrophe .
