anthony mcgarten has adapted his play 
via satellite ,
and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time .
chrissy dunn
( danielle cormack )
is a drop-out .
she has not achieved much in her latter year
and has grown resentful of her family since her father 's deathbed confession .
her twin sister 
carol
( also portrayed by danielle cormack )
is basking in the medium limelight
as she represents new zealand in swimming at the olympic .
a middle-aged 
desireless and desperate director
( brian sergent )
and his good-natured cameraman -
who is also chrissy 's one-night stand from the night previous - paul
( karl urban )
film the dunn family 's proudest moment ;
watching carol swim to victory .
this would not be so bad
but chrissy 's family is the epitome of embarrassing .
first of all there is the matriach of the wellingtonian dunns 
joyce
( donna akerston ) .
she makes fairy cake and cocktail sausage for the all-important film crew
and refuses to change the way
she is .
her oldest daughter 
jen
( rima te wiata )
is desperate to be something more than common .
she has a nice home
( with bedroom wall
painted `` blackberry sorbet '' ) ,
expensive taste and a nasty parasitic attitude to match .
she is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child .
her husband 
ken
( tim balme )
is an electrician and force himself on job
that do not need doing ... as well as doing job
that need to be done 
ie jen .
the middle daughter 
lyn
( jodie dorday -
who won best supporting actress at new zealand film award for this portrayal )
is a `` knocked-up '' tart
who has a dubious history with ken .
both older sister clash 
the mother is in a state ,
ken is as bad a tooltime tim taylor ,
carol is fuelling her olympic desire
and chrissy is aware
all of this is to be splashed on national tv -
why should not she be embarrassed ?
it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy
that has witty line to spare .
i loved the sparring between jen and lyn .
one is like an adult mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away ,
the other a narcisstic tramp
who has what her sister desires
- a bun in the oven .
climax of the film is quite sentimental
and is nicely done .
the performance are a treat and the film works perfectly .
a great way
to spend an hour-and-a-half .
