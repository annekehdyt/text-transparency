gosha 's last great film of the 1960 's .
a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his film 
gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu
( of zatoichi fame )
to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty .
`` tenchu ''
( heavenly judgment )
is the word
that the loyalist to the emperor yell
while assassinating enemy or `` traitor '' to the cause .
katsu plays up his character ' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride .
anybody
who question
the politician is labeled a `` traitor ''
and becomes an assassination target.one of the best photographed film ever ,
many shot are incredible composition of form 
color and light .
the fight scene are frequent and very bloody and utal .
the blood becomes a part of the color
palette gosha uses for his image .
gorgeous and disturbing .
while the personal story is simple to follow ,
the historical background is complicated
and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful
you can struggle through the film
without it .
the few drawback to the film are the music track 
the length and katsu 's occasional scenery chewing .
he has a drunken scene
that is way over the top for a film
but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk.downbeat but one of the great chambara film .
