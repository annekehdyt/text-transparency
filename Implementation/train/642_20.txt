hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare 's work .
branaugh is one heck of an actor .
his portrayal of this was just amazing .
his soliloquy were eathtaking .
for as long as it was it is rare for a film
to hold my interest ,
however i was engrossed in this particular piece .
i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare
and those not so much .
this has everything the modern world looks for in its film :
murder 
betrayal 
and deceit .
not to knock mel gibson 's version ,
but branaughs touch the whole work .
this leaves no stone unturned .
when you finish the film
it will feel
as if you read the play yourself .
um how you say `` two thumbs up '' .
