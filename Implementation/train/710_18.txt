interesting to read comment by viewer regarding omega code ...
many of the overwhelmingly positive comment were lifted almost word for word from tbn oadcast ... the movie looks
as if it were made to go directly to video ,
to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series
that was done by some other religious group in the 70s.. do
not remember it ?
you wont remember
this one either in a year or two .
this is the first movie i have ever seen
where it was implied
that it was your religious duty
to go to it
and buy as many ticket as possible
to save soul ... very shameful ...
this just goes to show
that
if you are a televangelist 's son ,
you too can play high-roller hollywood producer with lil ole lady tithe money ...
