this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film
( along the line of tale from the crypt )
written by robert bloch
( author of psycho ) .
it is good fun for horror fan
and has an excellent cast .
the movie should also be required
viewing for doctor
who fan since jon pertwee
( the third doctor )
has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star !
