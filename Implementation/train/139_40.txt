because that is all
she does through out this whole movie ,
is get naked for no good reason.when tarzan is bitten by a snake ,
she suddenly removes her clothes.since
when is a boa constrictor poisonous ?
how did tarzan get poisoned by the way ?
this whole movie is screwed up.they could not get the species of animal for this movie right.whats an orangutang doing hanging around those chimpanzee ?
he must have wandered off the set of a much better film.the group of cannibal tribe 's man look caucasin.why ?
and why was bo and her dad painted ,
if they were going to be eaten later ?
it was probably just a lame excuse
to show her east and curves again.her dad while hunting 
approach and act stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it.any real african bull elephant that was not from the circus 
would 've stomped this moron 's butt.any smart hunter would 've started shooting the minute he saw it.and i can not help but wonder if the camera was on lsd ,
because it kept showing various scene
that went in slow motion ,
for no good reason.it did not make good sense at all.the boa constrictor
that tarzan wrestled with in the water 
looks like one of those 12 ft rubber snake you can buy at a local spencer gifts.tarzan
was strangly speechless in this film ,
maybe from bo flashing herself so much.i am sorry ,
but this is a rip off of a classic black and white tarzan movie 
with a similar but better story.not to mantion plotting .there is one scene in that i saw
that everyone forgot to mantion .

( spoiler alert )
*the scene
where he is trying to rescue jane and her dad ,
has him standing too close to a running water spout.it made
it seem like
he is urinating on someone below him.eww !
also ,
him and jane are fooling around on a beach ,
with perverted monkey jumping
and clapping.she sure did take her dad 's death real well .

( end of spoiler )
*there should be a surgeon general 's warning on this film.that
seeing bo naked too much in this movie ,
will make you go blind .
