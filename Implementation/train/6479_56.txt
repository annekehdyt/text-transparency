i normally do not take the time
to make comment
that few person will read ,
about movie few will see .
however 
in this case 
i feel i must warn all those
who might consider wasting time on it .
i just finished watching it only five minute ago .
this is 
quite simply 
one of the worst movie
that i have ever seen in my life .
the acting is horrible ,
a plot is nonexistent ,
and production value are poverty level at best .
i know
that even a low budget movie can be great ,
but not this one .
there is only thing
that could have saved this movie for any horror fan 's purpose
-- more on-screen gore and slashing !
the grand total of three time
that this occurs
is off-screen .
while it is effective and reasonably disturbing
when it happens
-- especially the end scene --
there is simply not enough of it .
the movie is just too long
for it is minimal content 
too dialogue heavy ,
and consequently almost impossible to watch .
what happens ?
to put it all in a nutshell with room
to spare ,
three teenage girl irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area
where over 20 girl have previously been abducted and murdered .
their car 
of course 
eaks down ,
and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy person
-- one of whom is the psychotic killer .
all three are eventually murdered 
one by one 
off-screen ,
after what seems like an eternity of boring 
slow-paced nonsense .
as i said ,
the only thing worth
watching even once
are the murder .
please do not buy it or rent it just for that ,
and do not be fooled like i
was by the misleading box art and movie description .
save your money and your time .
