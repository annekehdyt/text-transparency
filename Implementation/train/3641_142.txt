`` pg-13 ''
( for some rough action 
and crude humor
including dialog )
say
what you will about it
( i know some person
who despise it to no end ) ,
but i have always thought that `` napoleon dynamite '' was a funny movie
-- not the ightest ick on the wall 
but a funny movie 
nonetheless .
jack black is also a very funny man
-- irritating at time 
yes 
and massively overrated by adolescent audience
who practically worship him 
but funny .
there has rarely been a jack black comedy
that i did not enjoy to some degree .
so 
i was very happy to hear
that jared hess 
the writer and director of `` napoleon dynamite '' 
and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar
who becomes a wrestler
to save an orphanage .
my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin .
unfortunately 
my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie .
this plot 
had it been done as a skit on some such show as `` saturday night live '' or possibly even `` mad tv '' ,
would have worked flawlessly .
unfortunately 
the plot runs far too thin over the approximate
one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy fall flat.nacho was raised in a mexican monastery
and became a devout man of the lord .
feeling shunned by the entire monastery 
nacho
( black ) ,
now the monastery 's cook 
decide to follow his dreams
to become a professional wrestler .
as the monastery 's finance hit an all-time low ,
nacho decide to join a wresting tournament
so that he can win the prize money
and provide good food for the monastery 's orphanage .
this plot sounds so sweet and caring .
it seems like the perfect movie for jack black .
look what he did with `` school of rock '' after all .
well 
to my displeasure 
this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor
that just takes away from the heart of the movie .
it is again hollywood 's way
of showing
that they feel
that teen audience will only understand fart joke and stupid humor of course 
for all i know ,
maybe that is the general thought of teenager ,
as many seemed to enjoy this movie .
watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make person laugh ,
but do not expect to get an award
for putting it in your movie .
a seven-year-old could make up the same joke.the performance in `` nacho lie ''
are actually good .
jack black proves once again
that he is absolutely hilarious
and that he can make even the most idiotic 
worthless line in ever put on paper comical .
unfortunately 
this movie just was not enough for him .
it did not give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his joke worked was because of him .
i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before ,
but now i can say
that 
not only is she quite talented ,
but she is also one of the most beautiful woman
to have ever graced my eyesight .
she just clicked in the role
and it worked wonderfully well .
h\u00e9ctor jim\u00e9nez ,
who plays nacho 's bumbling partner 
esqueleto ,
kept me laughing continuously .
he did a very nice job
and it was very effective
when partnered with that of jack black 's .
darius rose ,
who plays an orphan named chancho ,
did not have many line ,
but ,
what can i say ,
i just enjoyed him .
he was adorable .
the rest of the cast did their job .
it is unfortunate
that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie .
`` nacho lie '' just does not work .
its plot is stretched far too thin .
the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening joke
that just do not work .
i very rarely laughed and ,
if i did ,
it was because of jack black or another member of the cast .
and that leads me to the ight side of `` nacho lie '' :
yes 
the cast .
this cast was just well 
for lack of a better word ,
they were on .
they all clicked ,
had excellent chemistry together ,
and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script .
after jared hess 's `` napoleon dynamite '' kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie ,
i was surprised to find myself
so often bored with `` nacho lie '' .
something was lost here
and i have yet to understand what it was .
all i know is
that `` nacho lie '' is not a good movie and yet ,
because of its cast ,
it is completely worthless .
there is a small reason to watch ,
if only to watch jack black work .
but 
if you are not a fan of jack black ,
then avoid this movie like the plague .
i like black ,
but i am done with this movie and with this review.final thought :
yike !
this is jared hess 's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical `` napoleon dynamite '' .overall rating :
4/10
