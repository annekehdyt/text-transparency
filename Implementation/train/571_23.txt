the poverty row horror picture of the 1930s and '40s depress the hell out of me .
god knows i have nothing against low-budget film ,
but the one
produced in that period
have such a dreary ,
shabby look about them
-- and 
in the final analysis 
just are not very good .
`` the corpse vanish '' is slightly more entertaining than bottom-of-the-barrel dreck like `` the invisible ghost '' and `` the ape man '' ,
but it is no classic .
bela lugosi 
long past his `` dracula '' heyday 
plays yet another mad doctor ;
the unbearable elizabeth russell plays his wife .
they sleep in coffin
because ,
as lugosi explain to a doubtful young female reporter
( luana walter ) ,
a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed .
ho hum .
angelo rossitto and minerva urecal are also on hand ,
which might please hardcore fan of '30 and '40s film .
