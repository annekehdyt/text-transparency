i enjoyed this film .
i thought
it was an excellent political thriller about something
that is never happened
before - a secret service agent going bad
and involved in an assassination plot .
unfortunately 
for michael dougla ' character 
`` pete garrison 
''
they think
he is the mole
but he is not .
he is just a morally-flawed agent
having an affair with the first lady !
since he is doing that ,
he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam
and that makes him suspect number one
when it is revealed
there is a plot
to kill the president .
`` garrison '' is forced to go on the lam
but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing
by protecting the president .
dougla does a fine job in this role .
i do not always care the person
he plays
but he is an excellent actor .
keifer sutherland
( `` david breckinridge '' )
is equally as good
( at least in here )
as the fellow ss boss
who hunts down dougla
until convinced
he has been telling the truth .
when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop ,
if they can ,
the plot .
the crook are interesting 
too 
by the way .
also 
i have never -
and never will ,
unfortunately - see a first lady
who looks as good as kim basingerthis
is simply a slick action flick
that entertains start-to-finish .
are there hole in it ?
of course ; probably a number of them 
and a reason
you see so many critical comment .
however 
it is unfairly bashed here .
it just is not intelligent enough for the geniuse here on this website .
my advice : chill 
just go along for the ride
and enjoy all the action and intrigue .
yes 
it gets a little rambo-ish at the end
but otherwise it gets high mark for entertainment ...
..which is what movie are all about .
