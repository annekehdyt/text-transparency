this movie is another horror anthology .
it is rather good ,
but it could have used a bit more .
i compare it to `` doctor terror 's house of horror '' ,
though in this one the title fit .
it has four story all somewhat
connected by a house .
the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in .
he creates a killer for his latest novel
and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house .
this one is sort of predictable ,
but it does throw a few twist in the end .
the next story is a bit more unpredictable ,
and you really do not know
where the heck it is going .
this one features peter cushing
and was probably my favorite of the bunch .
this guy buys the house ,
but it is not the house
that takes center stage 
but a rather strange wax museum .
the third story starts out rather good and features christopher lee .
this one has him as a rather bizarre dad
who seems awfully protective of his daughter .
the problem is that once you know
what is going on the story does not end soon enough .
it drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion .
then the final tale concern an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop .
the actor really gets what he paid for .
then there is a small story about an officer
who is seen throughout
trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation
of why these thing happened .
though i was not very satisfied with the explanation
as i do not think
it really explained cushing 's story much at all .
i think
they needed a bit more back story for that one .
all in all though it was an interesting set of story .
