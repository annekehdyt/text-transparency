i saw dick tracy
when i was very young .
i did not know
who any of the actor were ,
and i did not know
the movie would turn out different than the way
it was previewed .
i sure loved it though.warren beatty star as the crime-fighting 1930 's detective dick tracy
who goes after the biggest mob boss in the city .
this time 
big boy caprice
( al pacino )
has killed a very powerful man
and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney
( madonna )
who has her eye on tracy .
it becomes even worse
because a new criminal is invading
and the worst part is :
this criminal has no face .
he or she is very unknown .
plus 
the famous villian are back from the comic book collection.i
thought
that this movie was very colorful and creative .
it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child .
warren beaty was just like jame bond of the 1930 's the way
he played dick tracy.an ensemble cast of the film includes :
charlie korsmo 
glenn headly 
william forsythe 
dustin hoffman 
jame caan 
ed o ' ross 
tommy lee jone 
mandy patinkin 
charle durning .
plus more ! dick tracy is a movie for all age
and is a fun movie for a family
to enjoy .
take my word for it .
