if you have seen friend ,
the writing will feel very familiar .
especially the last 3 or 4 season of friend often share the same comedy setups.the show is about a group of person
whose connection is that they shared the same class
when they were still rather young
( about 10 year old i think ) .
now 
they are in their mid-twenty ,
and they meet again on a class reunion .
this is where the series starts.a typical episode deal with multiple story line at once .
they are usually not connected in any way .
each story line is cut up into multiple section ,
which are then shown in a mixed order.the sketch
is where my problem lie with this series .
as in the later season of friend 
it is often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situation .
one of the main character does something really stupid
that is hard to believe .
the situation is then heavily exaggerated ,
as if it was not silly enough .
if you are into this kind of in-your-face humor ,
then maybe you will like this series .
for me it is a great turn-off.the reason
i started watching friend is because of the first few season .
there are interesting and especially credible story line ,
with some romance in it that makes you root for the character .
the class has none of this .
the character are simply too forced
and stereotype are pushed too far .
it is therefore not possible to relate to them and like them.at least with friend ,
it took several season
before it ran out of steam
and the character trait were all milked out .
but in the class 
it seems it has run out of steam
before it even started .
