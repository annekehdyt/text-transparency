the earth is destined to be no more thank to father pergado and a bunch of nun .
christopher lee
( who has since said
that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producer
who told him load of great actor
were involved )
is father pergado
and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine .
the cast are not too bad ,
though most have now retired from acting .
the film has terrible sound effect
( mainly created from pressing key on an old computer it seems )
and it ridiculously pondering at time -
showing a scene of the sky 
for instance ,
for what feel like hour at a time .
despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way
and the production is adequate .
interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie ;
meda band ;
writer frank ray perilli and charle band 's assistant bennah burton .
despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see
how it all worked out
and thus quite liked it .
