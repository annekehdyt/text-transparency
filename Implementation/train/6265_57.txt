this film takes place in the 1950s .
according to this the dead
( called zombie )
have arisen to eat the living .
however a company has developed a collar
that ,
when put around the zombie neck ,
makes them docile and perfect servant .
the robinson mom helen
( carrie-anne moss ) ,
dad bill
( dylan baker )
and son timmy
( k'sun ray )
hire a zombie
because everyone on their block
already has one .
tim names the zombie fido
( billy connolly )
and becomes friend with him .
but his dad hates him and timmy loose control of fido and thing go wrong.as
you can see this is
-- among many other thing --
a takeoff on the `` lassie '' series with fido being a stand in for lassie .
timmy was named that for a reason !
every single of the famous lassie episode are spun here .
my favorite is when timmy send fido off to get help
before the zombie eat him !
also it is a satire of those 1950s dougla sirk film
where everything is ight and colorful
-- but dark secret are tearing person apart .
the character wear very ight 1950s clothe
( moss is always in a dress )
-- the furnishing ,
setting and car especially are all 1950s in hyper ight color .
even when the script becomes repetitious there is always something to look at .
the script is good
-- but there are only so many lassie joke
you can make .
the melodramatic are kind of silly
but the cast pulls it off .
everyone here is excellent and right on target .
even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job .
moss is the best
-- playing each line for all its worth --
-but never going overboard.this
is not for everybody
( of course ) .
the satire may be lost on most person
and the gore is pretty tame .
the gore is done so casually
and with happy music
playing over it it is hard to take it seriously .
so 
for some person 
this will really work .
i give it an 8 .
