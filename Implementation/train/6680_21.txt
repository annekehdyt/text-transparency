loved part one 
the impossible planet 
but whoop ,
what a disappointment part two 'the satan pit ' is .
the cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was -
nothing coming out of the pit .
then ages spent crawling round air vent
to pad out the story ,
the beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence 
so no doctor/villain confrontation i would been anticipating .
the tardis is somehow inside the pit
despite the pit not being open till
long after the tardis fell through the planet crust .
and finally another ready made solution
which existed for no logical reason
- i mean ,
why not plunge the beast into the hole
as soon
as the pit opened ?
why not plunge him in all those year ago instead of imprisoning him anyway .
why not - i could go on but i have lost interest ...
