the violent and rebel twenty-five year old sailor antwone fisher
( derek luke )
is sent to three session for evaluation with the navy psychiatrist dr. jerome davenport
( denzel washington ) ,
after another outburst and aggression against a superior ranked navy man .
reluctant in the beginning of the treatment ,
he gets confidence in dr. davenport and discloses his childhood ,
revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house .
meanwhile 
he meets cheryl smolley
( joy briant ) ,
and they fall in love for each other .
resolving his personal problem ,
antwone becomes a new man .
this true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man
who finds a friend
and is sent back to a regular life .
the direction of denzel washington is excellent ,
making sensitive 
attractive and with good taste 
a story about child abuse .
in the hand of another director 
it might be a very heavy story .
my vote is eight.title
