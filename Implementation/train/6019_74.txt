i first saw rob roy twelve year ago .
with little money for entertainment 
i rented it for my fianc\u00e9 and i to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night .
the movie i had wanted was gone ,
so i rented this instead ,
not expecting much ,
and was very much surprised with how good it was .
i just recently watched it again ,
and loved it every bit as much as the first time .
for those unfamiliar with the story ,
it is about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor 
a cattleman and folk hero .
from the little i know
about the man and his story ,
liberty have been taken with the fact ,
but it is a movie 
not a textbook ,
and so the filmmaker can be excused .
basically 
the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose
to buy cattle
which he then intends to sell
and reap a large profit from .
but 
his plan is foiled
when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest .
our hero finds himself on the run
after failing to settle the matter with the marquis ,
and mary 
his wife 
suffers a sadistic rape at the hand of archibald cunningham 
a smarmy englishman with no soul .
atrocity ensue 
until 
in an immensely satisfying conclusion 
rob carf archibald up like a christmas turkey .
there are many great performance in this movie ,
but allow me to touch specifically on a few .
liam neeson 
as usual 
is fantastic 
a sexy beast
you can not take your eye off of .
honestly 
this man is like ice cream :
even
when he is bad he is good .
his rob roy is an honourable man struggling
to provide for those
who depend on him 
in the best way
he knows how .
jessica lange 
as mary 
gives this woman a fierceness
which is a nice change from the simpering ,
dull movie wife audience are usually forced to endure .
you just know
she does not take any b.s from rob 
or anyone else for that matter .
tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald 
yet somehow ,
it works .
all the posturing and preening ,
combined with some wicked dialogue ,
result in one of the most memorable movie villain in recent memory .
combine all of this ,
and the stellar work by other supporting player 
with the luscious scenery of scotland ,
and you have what amount to one really ,
really cool movie .
if you have not seen this ,
i highly recommend
that you do .
