a great addition to anyone 's collection.12 monkeys is a movie
you do not see every day .
it has excellent actor to go with a excellent story .
this is not a normal role for bruce willi
but he holds the role
like he holds john mcclane.the virus-kill everyone on earth
and leaves a few hundred survivor story is not a new one
but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.a man
( bruce )
is sent back in time
to get information on a virus
which has wiped out most of man kind.the actor in this
were awesome .
i must give a mention to brad pitt
who was hilarious as the mental patient jame cole
( bruce )
meets in a mental hospital.the director did an amazing job on inging us a disturbing picture of a future
devastated by a man-made virus.the animal
seen in the virus world made
it feel
like they run the world
when human are driven into underground facilities.this movie was excellent
and must see
and also its a must own.i very much highly recommend it.10/10
