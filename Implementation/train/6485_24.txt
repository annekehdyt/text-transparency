not only did they get the character all wrong ,
not only do the voice suck ,
not only do the writer seriously need to get girlfriend ,
not only are the drawing really crude ,
but it seems like it was mainly created for age 1-6. the only episode i have ever seen of this show
that kept me watching ,
was `` a mattter of family '' ,
because i liked the robin character .
and sometimes i think
it is just a general copy of batman the animated series .
example : in bta 
bruce is friend with harvey dent 
yeah ?
over a two episode story ,
he transforms into the unlikely villain 
twoface .
in the `` show '' bruce is friend with that ethan guy 
and over a two episode story 
he transforms into the unlikely villain clayface .
that was just a small example
( that may not even be true ) ,
but in short 
this is the worst attempt on a batman series .
and that is saying something .
