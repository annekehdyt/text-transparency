i did not watch the entire movie .
i could not watch the entire movie .
i stopped the dvd
after watching for half an hour and i suggest
anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves
before taking the disc out of the case.i like mafia movie both tragic and comic but corky romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy.the problem
is corky romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh ,
the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris kattan
( corky )
from one scene to another .
corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerism come across
as contrived - chris kattan is clearly 'acting ' rather than taking a role -
it bounces you right out of the story .
each scene is utterly predictable 
the 'comedic event '
that will occur on the set
is obvious
as soon as each scene is introduced .
in comedy such as mr. bean the disaster
caused by the title character
are funny
because you can empathise with the character motivation and initial event and the situation
the character ends up in
is not telegraphed .
corky however gives the feeling
that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt
to draw a laugh from the audience.if chris
had not played such an alien character
( who never really connects with the other character in the movie )
and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable
( except for trying to draw laugh )
and the comedy scene were not so predictable
and stereotyped - all the joke seemed far too familiar )
this movie could have been watchable .
but it is not .
do not watch it .
