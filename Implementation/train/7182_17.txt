i saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show
and fell in love with it.it took 30+ year ,
but i recently did find it on dvd -
it was not cheap ,
either - in a catalog
that specialized in war movie .
we watched it last night for the first time .
the audio was good ,
however it was grainy
and had the trailer between reel .
even so 
it was better than i remembered it .
i was also impressed at how true it was to the play.the catalog is around here someplace .
if you are sincere in finding it ,
fire me a missive and i will see
if i can get you the info .
