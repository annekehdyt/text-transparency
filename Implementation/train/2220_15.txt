i loved this excellent movie .
farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart .
she plays a woman
who is driven to extreme measure to protect herself and her friend
after she is attacked by a stranger .
after being rejected by the police
she realizes
she is on her own.then one day
when she at home alone the stranger eaks into her home and attacks her again .
not being about to call the police
or get him out
she is forced to spray him in the eye and imprison him in her fireplace.i think
there is a need for a wake up call to the law of the land .
they are too easy on these criminal .
it is time for more harsh punishment .
