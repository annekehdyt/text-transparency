best of the best 4 
is better than 3 ,
but just barely .
basically 
i say this
because part 4 does not contradict part 1/2
( like 3 does ) ,
( ie .
their is no reference to tommy lee
having sibling )
.anyway 
i liked the russian plot line of the story 
and especially sven ole-thorsen 's bit part as boris .
aside from that though and a few fighting scene ,
the movie is nothing special .
the limited budget is also very noticeable
( especially in the airplane blow-up scene )
.also 
part 4 does not really have a moral
or say anything like part 3 did ,
there are a couple of more better known actor
( hudson 
thorsen )
in part 4 
but alas nothing like the beginning of the series
( and even these character have very small role )
.alas ,
it seems best of the best is the rhee show ,
and to be truthful ,
he can not carry a movie.saw on tape 
rating:4
