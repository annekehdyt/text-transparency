i love these `` diaper baby '' movie !
you could not make a movie like this today
and it is rich in cinematic history .
it is goofy
and the film was made to make you laugh ,
which it does .
how they ever got these kid to `` act '' i
will never know .
i think
they are precious and the kid make me laugh
but so do the other
who made this movie
as it shows the naivet\u00e9
that existed in the early 30 's .
you have to remember
that this is
when the film industry was very young ,
the stock market had crashed ,
the world wide depression was beginning
and these film were made to give a person a eak from the real world .
the fact
that you could see movie for five cent
is beyond my comprehension ,
but then dinner for 25 cent is too .
it was a different time with a totally different mind set .
