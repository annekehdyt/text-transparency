ok another film
bought by me and joe swatman .
ok this is not the worst film i have reviewed this week
but it still sucked royaly .
we had a lot of fun
watching this piece of crap.the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional student idea ,
u just know ur in for trouble
when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun ,
the film was not as gory
as we hoped ,
i mean on of the death is a heart attack .
again i think
the acting suck 
sum of the actor must be porn star
and one get into her undy for what ever reason .
the absolute worst part is the ending ,
it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw 2
but that never gunna happen let face it.my rating :
funny 4/100 mock
( how much fun we had mocking it )
73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100
