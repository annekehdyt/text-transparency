the golden era of disney cartoon was dying by the time the end of the 90s .
this show quack pack should not even be considered a ducktale spin off
because the show barely had anything to do with ducktale .
it is about a teen-aged huey 
dewey and louie
as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo
and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktale .
i prefer the little adventurous nephew from ducktale .
there are human in duckburg
and the duck are the only animal living in duckburg .
there is no reference of scrooge mcduck .
the story are repetitive ,
the plot is boring
but the animation is good .
if you want lot of slapstick humor ,
i recommend this to you .
if you want a better disney show watch `` darkwing duck '' or `` ducktale '' .
