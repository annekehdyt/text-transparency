after reading ton of good review about this movie i decided to take it for a spin
( i bought it on dvd ,
hence the `` spin '' pun ... i am a dork ) .
the beginning was everything i hoped for 
a perfect set-up
( along with some quote
that i have heard on various wu-tang album )
to what should have been a good movie .
but the plot i heard was so great ,
was so predictable .
every time i saw a character
( except for the lizard )
i guessed
which venom
he was .
plus 
the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie .
ok 
so the plot was not very good
but at least there was some good kung-fu right ?
wrong .
the fight were very short and few and far between .
granted the different style were all pretty cool
but i wish the fight were longer .
i kept hoping to see the lizard run
and do some crazy ish on the wall
but it never happened .
i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish
but it never happened .
i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minute
but it never happened .
in short 
not much happen .
the fighting is all pretty routine .
do not be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot ,
it does not mean it is a good one .
