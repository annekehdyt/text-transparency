i am trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .
`` i am thinking matrix ,
i am thinking bladerunner ,
i am thinking that chick
that plays faith in angel ,
wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her 
leave
that one with us .
only - get this !
- we will do it
without any plot 
dialogue 
character 
decent action or budget 
just some loud bang and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike .
fanboy dig loud bang and hot chick in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bike 
right ?
`` flashy 
shallow 
dreary 
formulaic 
passionless 
tedious 
dull 
dumb 
humourless 
desultory 
barely competent .
live action anime
without any action ,
or indeed any life .
sf just the way joe fanboy likes it 
in fact .
