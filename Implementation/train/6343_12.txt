broad enough for you ?
wait till you see this heavy handedadaption of a little collegiate one act .
what is shocking and wild incollege rarely holds up over time ,
and this is proof .
to take on thecatholic church with oadside humor
just is not shocking orinteresting or funny ,
it is kind of boring .
the performer are allgame ,
giving all they have got ,
but it is basically a play
that does notopen up to film well .
not a lot of fun .
