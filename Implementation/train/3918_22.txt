first of all ,
when person hear 'guy ritchie ' ,
they immediately think of snatch .
yes 
snatch was a good movie ,
but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch .
they do not expect him to explore new frontier .
this movie revolver is different than snatch ;
it is much darker
and is very complex .
the reason
i gave a rating of 10
is because i have had to watch revolver 3 time
to understand everything .
so this movie toys with your head .
it is very cleverly written.this movie is different than snatch .
it was done wonderfully ,
the cinematography is beautiful ,
and you can recognize guy ritchie 's personal touch
( style of directing )
in it.what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist
and how we are left with more question than answer .
