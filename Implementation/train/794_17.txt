`` story of the century '' was a half hour series
and appeared in first run syndication during the '54-'55 television season .
it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award .
starring veteran western actor jim davis as railroad detective matt clark 
the series set clark and his fellow railroad detective partner
( mary castle as frankie adam for the first half of the season and kristine miller as `` jonesy '' during the second half )
against historic western outlaw of various period
ranging from the mid-1860 's to the early 1900 's .
the series was very satisfying 
easy to watch ,
and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of jim davis in the lead role .
he seemed like an actual western character .
one other note .
when matt clark would arrive in town
after a long ride he actually looked
like he had been on a long horse ride
as he would be covered in dust.a very good early adult western .
