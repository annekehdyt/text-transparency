i found this movie to be exciting right from the start
-- like a spielberg movie is --
and found the plot
to be intriguing
as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was.right from the start --
before the opening credit --
the action starts ,
inging with it immediate suspense.the two main character are very likable .
( i have trouble liking any of the baldwin 
due to alec 's extra-curricular 
political activity ,
but william was not too bad in this movie .
) there were several highly unexpected twist ,
which contributed to the enjoyment.there were 
unfortunately 
many place
where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack
-- something like 19k hz .
i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitor on the set .
