return to cabin by the lake does
not 
in any way 
stand up to the original .
with only one main character
( stanley )
returning for the sequal ,
the film is not even worth the 2 hour of your time .
i am a huge fan of the first film ,
the story line and acting was really good ,
but this is one movie
that i will never again watch .
it is basically equal to what the sequal to urban legend and blair witch were like 
but with much worse acting .
i have personally seen better acting in soap opera ,
it is so pitiful
that you just have to laugh .
i 
in no way 
recommend this movie to anyone ,
watching it will just detract from the first .
