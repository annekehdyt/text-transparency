this is a horrid disaster of a film .
from beginning to end ,
it is filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing .
the only redeeming part of the film are a few number by streisand ,
because the kristofferson part are impossible to watch or listen to .
the main problem of this film is that we never see kristofferson 's character at his peak or streisand 's character struggling .
the first should be seen in decline and the second rising .
the final streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finale in film ,
if it was directed and edited properly .
the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake .
had the band ,
audience and wide shot of the stage
been shown ,
this number could have been dynamic and interesting .
this film must have been directed and edited by an nyu film school dropout .
the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay .
the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film ,
and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decision .
