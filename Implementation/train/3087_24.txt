as a long-standing bara fan 
any posting like this will be biased .
that aside 
this film ranks as a classic .
it has it is flaws
( emphasized in other posting ) ,
but gives a glimpse of a time
( late 70 )
that will never be there again ,
and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.streisand fought hard
to make this movie her own .
i do not think
she was ever satisfied .
but it gives her fan a new bara
( for the time )
with live singing 
a young fresh appearance ,
and some very heavy-duty acting.the story is rough 
but exciting ,
and holds your interest throughout .
the extended one frame `` finale '' is hard for most non-bara fan
to sit through ,
but it speaks volume to those
who admire her talent .
