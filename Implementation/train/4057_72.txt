ida lupino was one of the few woman
to eak through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system .
not surprisingly 
she also tackled proto-feminist theme
that ,
when touched at all ,
were approached in so gingerly a manner
that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about .
in outrage 
she treats rape and its aftermath ,
and though throughout the short movie it is referred to as `criminal assault 
'
she leaves 
for once 
no doubt about what happened.mala power
( in her official debut )
plays a secretary-bookkeeper at a big industrial plant ;
she lives with her parent
but is engaged to a swell guy
( robert clarke ) ,
who just got a raise
and now makes $ 90 a week .
leaving the plant
after working late one night ,
she finds herself being stalked .
in the ensuing scene \u0096 the best in the movie \u0096
she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of building and alley
but fails.when she returns home 
disheveled and in shock ,
the police can not get much out of her ;
she claims
she never saw her attacker
( who manned a snack truck outside the factory ) .
trying to pretend that nothing happened ,
she returns to her job but falls apart ,
thinking
that everybody is staring at her 
judging her .
she goes into a fugue state ,
running away to los angele on a bus
but stumbling off at a rest stop .
waking up in a strange ranch house ,
she learns
that she is been rescued by tod andrew 
a young minister in a california agricultural town .
she lies about her identity
and takes a job packing orange .
the two fall vaguely in love ,
but it is clear to andrew that power is keeping dire secret .
when 
at a company picnic 
she seizes a wrench
and cracks the skull of jerry paris ,
who was trying to steal a kiss ,
the truth about her past comes out ... .it
was a courageous movie
to come out in 1950 ,
and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcoming .
lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene ,
and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental ,
ending up talky and didactic .
yes 
lupino had important information to impart ,
but she did not trust the narrative to speak for itself .
her cast 
pleasant but bland and generic 
were not much help 
either 
reverting to melodramatic posture or homespun reassurance .
but outrage was a eakthrough 
blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is ,
and what it really means to its victim .
