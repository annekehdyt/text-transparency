although the production and jerry jameson 's direction are definite improvement ,
`` airport '77 '' is not much better than `` airport 1975 '' :
slick 
commercial rubbish submerging
( this time literally )
a decent cast .
jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner
which gets hijacked by art thieve
and crash into the sea
( all the publicity claimed
it was near the bermuda triangle ,
but there is no mention of it in the film itself ) .
when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water ,
we see all their crane dropping
( rather blindly )
into the ocean and it is hard not to laugh
( imagining the crane plugging the plane 
the passenger and the waterlogged script ) .
nbc used to air what appeared to be the `` director 's cut '' 
with at least an hour of extra footage
-- mostly flashbacks --
injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a `` gilligan 's island '' episode .
most exciting moment is the plane crash ,
and some of the player have a little fun :
lee grant is an obnoxious drunk 
brenda vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess 
joseph cotten and olivia de havilland are flirting oldster .
still 
the personality conflict and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one 's patience .
