this is a review of the wizard ,
not to be confused with the wiz 
or mr. wizard .
the wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy 's ability
to play video game
and walk during the entire opening credit .
the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz ,
and mr. wizard is that guy
that attached 100 straws together
and had some kid drink tang out of it.now
that we have gotten all
that out of the way ,
let me say this :
there is really no reason to see this movie .
it is simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial
designed to capitalize on the powerglove ,
the legend of zelda and super mario brother 3. i use the word `` designed '' in the loosest sense possible ,
because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of person
who had never played nintendo ,
and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother .
maybe if the writer and director sat down
and actually played some game together ,
they had realize
that they were about to film total rubbish
and instead go to vocational school
to learn how to install car stereos.i hope
that this has been an enlightening experience for you .
it sure has not been for me .
in fact 
i think
i might have lost a few aincell in the act
of watching this movie
and writing about it .
next time you are at the video store
and you see the the wiz ,
the wizard and the wizard of oz all
sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row ,
give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead .
