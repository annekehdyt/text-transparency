half the review were good
so i took a chance for $ 10 .
sure priscilla barne had some sex talk
but it was not much .
the whole plot later
that she may be the other actress mother
and the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it .
its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time .
boogie night was based on real person
that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing
that ever happened in the industry .
it could have shocked with what popular today in adult film mocking today gonzo video
and that big orgy
that they had 5 minute
to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger and better decade ago in the early 1970s .
