there are few comedy like this ,
where almost every line and every character come close to flawless .
this is soooo funny ! !
and it has quite a bit of satire there to .
sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actor
and does a good 
if not perfect 
job with her daytime tv-diva .
sometimes her acting is just a little to oad and over the top ,
but 90 % of the time she is a riot !
in the same league is kevin kline 
robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg
( who unfortunately has too little to do here ) .
downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian
and has not the timing right all the time ,
but he struggles with his part
which is ,
to be honest 
the most ungrateful one .
but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste 
a true bitch
if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret
( you will see in the absolutely stunning finale ! ) .
sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part .
i normally like ms shue ,
but here she acts as a fish out of water
and sometimes seems to be in a different movie .
but it is not something damaging
and for the most part she is at least adequate .
otherwise 
imming with memorable line and situation 
this is a comedy
to watch
whenever it is on tv or wherever .
