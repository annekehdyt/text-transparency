i was not at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest
hit `` hostel '' ,
and most of these lame ass knock-off are just as bad or worse -
yet `` live feed '' managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minute .
started off with plenty of sex and sleazy setting ,
followed by some good death scene
involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7-foot 
leather-aproned butcher ...
what put me out of the movie was the tough 'hero ' with the gun and a grudge saving the day ... i would call this movie mediocre 
at best ,
since a premise
mainly involving obnoxious young person
being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater ,
doubling as a hideout for the mafia ,
is appealing to me .
if only the torture was prolonged enough
to be thoroughly effective ,
then my rating would have differed greatly .
unfortunately 
most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene ,
leaving the rest of the movie
to conclude as a revenge-type scenario .
so 
basically 
it is just a low-budget `` hostel '' rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex ,
almost constant during the first half of the film ... overall ,
i would say
do not bother with this one .
