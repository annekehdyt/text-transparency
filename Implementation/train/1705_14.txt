despite of the success in comedy or drama ,
the turkish director are failure in horror-thriller .
`` okul-d @ bbe '' are good example for the awful horror turkish films.but
if you watch `` gen '' you
will understand
that it is a strike .
the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark .
also the special feature are colorful and not cheap .
the soundtrack fit the movie ,
but the script is not totally perfect
and the theme of the movie is ordinary.as a result `` gen '' does not add any difference to horror movie ,
but it does not disappoint thriller fan .
in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey .
