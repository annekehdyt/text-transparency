young and attractive japanese person are getting on the wrong side of some curse again ,
this time it involves mobile phone .
various person die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed ,
so essentially if you have seen more than 2 recent japanese horror film
you can plot this film in the dark with your hand tied.the main attraction here is the fact
that takashi miike is behind the camera .
so far i have been more impressed with his low key work like city of lost soul ,
however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo-cronenberg style of audition .
despite a lot of his film
being essentially empty 
at least they do have merit such as these 
or at least something
to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suit impersonating johnny depp .
there is none of that in one missed call ;
there is just very little of credit :
the acting is bland and average ,
there is very little ( nothing 
in all honesty )
in the way of scare or suspense 
and in place it is just downright boring.however ,
there are moment where miike 's glacier-like sense of humour seep through the bland commercialism ;
most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subject ,
and the tv programmer more concerned about his rating than the girl ' life .
but aside from this there is nothing to suggest
it is miike behind the camera ;
most notably his usual visual flair has vanished
without a trace
( and that includes his famous gore ) ,
although it is more likely
he just did not have any enthusiasm for the project ,
and i can understand why .
one missed call is not offensively bad .
it is just frustratingly average.miike obviously loves directing .
with his huge yearly output it is obvious
he is not going to be 100 % concerned about all his project .
but even with this in mind 
one missed call felt
like
he was just paying the bill .
