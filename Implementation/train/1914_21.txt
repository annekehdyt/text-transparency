the previous reviewer has said it exactly .
i saw it once ,
was enchanted ,
saw it a second time
when it was re-oadcast within a week or two of the first airing .
i still remember some of the scene .
the setting is the opening of the 20th century ,
the war
referred to in the title
is world war i. one of the scene was set in a woman-only section of a public place ,
which was an interesting historical note .
the moment
when one of the woman first touches the other
is one of my all-time great movie moment .
i do not think of this as a `` gay movie 
''
it is an interesting and tender period love story ,
where the two principal happen to be woman .
i would love to see this movie again ;
i would buy this one
if it ever came out on dvd .
