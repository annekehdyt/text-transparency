( very light spoiler 
maybe . )
normally a fan of diane keaton ,
i tried to watch this tonight .
i had to switch it off before the second hour
because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother .
both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for other ,
with the daughter also adding in rude 
disrespectful and reckless to the mix .
when the daughter died 
the only thing i thought was ,
`` at least we will not have to watch her anymore . ''
keaton did a good job
of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving ,
but it was too far gone for me by then .
i simply was not enjoying it ,
so i stopped watching .
if you want me to care for the protagonist ,
you need to get me caring about the character much sooner
-- if it is nearly an hour in and i do not care ,
it is too late.the supporting cast was sincere and well played --
i felt for *them !
*
-- and the gay best friend was wonderful ,
but even combined ,
that was not enough
to carry the film for me .
