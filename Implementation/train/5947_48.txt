this series premiered on the cable tv station `` comedy central '' in the united state .
it was chopped to death ,
and shown out of sequence .
this was sad for the audience
it should have attracted ,
it did not and fell by the wayside .
luckily 
at the same time my cable company went digital
and i got the bbc .
thank goodness
because i got to see `` the league of gentleman '' in order 
complete and uncut .
`` the league of gentleman '' troupe is right up there with england 's `` monty python 's flying circus '' and canada 's `` the kid in the hall '' .
but..a warning .
`` the league of gentleman '' though are one step beyond .
it is not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ill ,
it goes deeper and much 
much 
darker .
i can tell many of you now
-- it will offend certain group of person ,
it will enrage other .
but remember 
its only comedy..dark 
dark comedy .
if that is not your thing ,
do not watch .
if you think you know dark comedy 
watch this
-- if you get angry and upset ,
then you do not quite know dark comedy .
these guy got it right ,
and right on the button .
they are illiant ,
they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation .
there is a complete story
that is told here from episode one to the end .
you can not watch this one episode at a time 
willy nilly ,
that is one of the charm of this series .
watch it in order .
see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed
these guy are .
no one and nothing is out of bound .
that 
my dear 
is `` dark humor '' .
bravo !
