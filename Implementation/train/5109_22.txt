my friend had the idea
of watching the animated lotr
after seeing the peter jackson return of the king .
so i finally bought it off e-bay ,
thinking right from the start
it was going to suck .
actually 
it really was not as bad as i thought
it would be .
the animation was good for its time ,
they used a unique method of blending live action with animation
to create some interesting effect ,
and the guy
who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood.not the greatest adaptation of a book ,
but trust me 
i have seen a lot worse .
it skips quite a lot of thing ,
since both fellowship and the two tower are compressed into one two hour movie .
definatley worth a watch ,
kid might like 
but still 
absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy .
