to be honest i knew what to expect
before i watched this film ,
and i have got to say
it has the worst acting i have ever seen .
it does have its moment ,
and on a comedy level its very entertaining ,
but i am afraid its not scary ,
and stupidity is taken to a new level .
there is a lot of unnecessary gore ,
and the plot is all over the place .
i have no idea
why the alien were evil ,
and why they even came to this remote part of wale ,
( i mean who 'd go there anyway ? )
but i did not care at that point ,
because i was amused by the costume 
and the bad cgi .
as far as b-movie go 
this deserves the title of 'being so bad 
its good ' 
and kudos to the film-maker ,
because they probably knew
what they were doing .
long may these film continue ... ..
