i have seen most 
if not all of the laurel and hardy classic film .
i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly ,
even after watching it over and over again .
this new film attempt to ing back the classic with two new actor
who resemble both laurel and hardy ,
however fails miserably for various reason .
one of which is how out of place their cloth are
( still early 20th century )
however are both portrayed in the 90 's setting .
some of the former dialogue was ought back ,
however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series .
this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen
and should be pulled off the shelf
and locked away forever .
the real laurel and hardy are surly spinning in their grave at such a bad imitation .
