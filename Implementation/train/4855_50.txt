seriously crappy movie.first off ,
the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store .
the `` bad '' cop takes a girl ,
which they had pulled over 
into the warehouse 's attic ,
while the newbie cop sit outside and ponder what could be happening up there .
the `` bad '' cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag ,
and the newbie cop does not think
there are any problem ,
but he still wonders what was in the bag ,
so he asks ,
gets a bullshit response ,
and then he thinks
everything is ok
( for now )
.the `` bad '' cop repeats this process ,
and even once with a tit scene
( made it slightly better ) .
but eventually person start to catch on ,
which took awhile considering
how f***ing obvious it was .
one girl gets a voodoo curse
placed on her just in case
she dies 
like ya do .
now 
the `` bad '' cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch ,
and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body.since
she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her ,
she comes back with lot of eye-shadow on ,
which is supposed to indicate
that she may be a zombie ... also ,
the magic curse causes all of the other girl
to become `` eye-shadow monster '' .
some of the girl meet up with a dude ,
who is apparently a currency specialist ,
and he offers them a ride
( they look normal to him apparently ) .
but when the girl see other person 
such as the one girl husband 
he freaks out
because she is hideous
( some person freak out ,
but other do not even notice )
... . massive plot hole.so ,
to wrap it up ,
the eye-shadow monster kill the `` bad '' cop ,
who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene .
it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel !
like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping .
