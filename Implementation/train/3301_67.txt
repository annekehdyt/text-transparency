there are a couple of prior comment here
which opine about this flick 's abundance of clich\u00e9s throughout
-- and i agree completely ,
both with regard to the character and the dialog.i would read about elizabeth berkly 's awful performance in the equally-awful `` showgirl 
''
which i have never seen - and her performance here ,
while not awful ,
is barely up to the standard of lifetime 's worse fare .
there was not a hint of depth to her character ,
but then there probably should not have been .
if so 
it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance ,
since there was not a hint of depth or charisma -
not a trace - in any one character 
performer 
or portrayal.the principal 's handling of liz 's initial complaint
after her tutee had kissed her in the hall
was laughable .
her husband 's initial reaction and advice were likewise
( forrest gump 
attacking jenny 's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic 
intelligent action 
and 
hell ,
he was mentally-challenged )
.the smarmy 
unctuous lawyer
( excuse the redundancy )
father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance :
he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time 
no mean feat .
her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd ,
also not unknown in the profession.finally
( and frankly 
i rather enjoyed this part ) ,
the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs ,
that you would rather depend upon barney fife ,
without andy ,
to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community .
i know
that most real-like cop fall a bit short of the sharpness 
intelligence and empathy of the level
displayed by most character on the `` law and order '' series ' ,
and the like
-- but dolt of this level seem to be a staple on `` lifetime .
`` finally 
i found a kind of `` story within a story '' fascination with josh 's concoction of his being the `` victim '' of his teacher .
this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story .
this was something of an achievement 
like going from `` f '' to `` f-minus .
`` this whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minute ,
following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authority ,
with husband involved .
but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following ,
and left an hour 's blank film in the camera .
but the writer
( s ) here ,
proved with their ending ,
they could do even worse .
when the situation was finally `` resolved ''
and `` righted 
'' this was accomplished in all of about 45 second ,
with no indication of what measure might have been forthcoming in any `` real world '' context for the perpetrator and his parent ,
or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.this one 's a 2* presentation ;
the second `` * ''
because it does
have some mild `` fascination . ''
