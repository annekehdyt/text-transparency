i rented this movie on dvd .
i knew
that the movie would not live up to what it promised me on the back of the case ,
but
once i saw that leatherface
( gunnar hansen )
was in it ,
i had to rent it .
it starts off pretty good ,
with the premise being
that snuff film are being aired over cable .
however 
the main character has nothing about her
to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever ,
and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging .
there are way too many unanswered question .
there was a great scene at the end
that totally took me by surprise ,
but overall this is a very sub par movie ,
but i guess
it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee .
