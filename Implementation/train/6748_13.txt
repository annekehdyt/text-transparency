i did not think
it was possible for a horror comedy film
to fail so abysmally on both front ... .really awful .
the fact
that it does not take itself seriously
( usually a good thing )
works against it ,
primarily because the actor are so wooden you really would swear
they are reading cue card .
on the upshot
though ... ..the mst3k version 
as always 
has a few laugh ... .
