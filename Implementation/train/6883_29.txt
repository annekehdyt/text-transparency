how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie `` congo express
( 1986 ) '' ?
there are also some character in congo express put together
without having really a relation to each other :
jean ,
( de congolee ) ,
the workman 
the two taxi-driver 
the street-singer 
roger 
guy 
lucienne and gilbert .
of course 
tom barman is a star
and luc gubbel was not .
that should not be a reason to pardon the flaw in the script
( if there is a script )
of anyway
the wind blows .
the joke
( the only one ! )
at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie `` de witte
( 1934 ) ''
where de witte is putting too much salt on the potato .
some accident happen in the movie
but there comes no explanation after .
tom barman deliver us here a movie
that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatre .
another missed chance for flemish cinema .
