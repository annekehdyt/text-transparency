i seriously love this film so much ,
i never get sick of watching it .
the only line i really can not stomach in this
is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that ,
everything else is perfect .
i have never been a fan of pj sole
and it did not help to hear
that she did not even know
who the ramone were until she filmed this movie ,
but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part .
most person
who watch this over and over
are fan of the ramone and really..
that is the only reason
i love it so much .
i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza line or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over 
haha .
one of the best part of the film is seeing
them sing do you want to dance 
down the hall of the high school.. i love it .
the special edition dvd has a good retrospective ,
surprisingly pj sole is not on it .
maybe she was working on another project *laugh* anyway 
great film ,
even better if you are a ramone fan .
