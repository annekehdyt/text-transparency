there are many good thing about the new bsg :
there is the multiple cylon role for model 8 and 6 
for example ,
which the two actress played superbly .
there is the old school feel
of industrial design aboard galactica
( `` my ship will not be networked ,
over my dead body ! '' )
also 
all the space battle 
the special effect
( even though the seasoned sci-fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all )
the darkness of the character 
their essentially flawed nature.that makes it all the more bitter
that the ending was so childish.yes 
the first part 
the scene in space 
the raid on the cylon and all
that was very good .
but the mushy ending ?
i always watch film
and show these day with the timer hidden ,
so i never know
how much time is left until the end .
so for me it was a special kind of torture ,
to see the end happen over and over again .
every time i thought ,
oh this is the final scene ,
the final shot 
i got one more .
every frakking character got its complete ending !
that was not really necessary.what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all :
the young roslin scene .
why is important for us to know that :
{ a } she lost her sister and father in a horrible accident and { b }
that she has a one night stand with a former pupil/student ?
what does that ing to the story ?
where was the linkage ?
now 
i am all for a more european-ish style approach ,
and a random act of whateverness in film and show ,
and all that ,
but this was just ridiculous .
this did not ing anything meaningful to the story.also ,
i have seen the `` last frakkin special ''
and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot :
he could not come up with a good ending for the story 
so ... .
he just did not !
it is never as much about the character
as they made the last episode to be .
the whole `` this was thousand of year in the past '' idea 
the mitochondrial eve thing 
was also used in the hitchhiker guide to the galaxy ,
and believe you me ,
there are a lot of bsg watcher
who know that particular h2g2 storyline .
and speaking of hera ,
now there is a storyline
that was not worked out well 
at all .
instead we get roslin
is doing her former pupil
who 's 20 year younger .
do not get me wrong ,
i am all for older woman with younger man .
the more power to them .
but this ... just made no sense.all in all ,
( the writing in )
this series is as flawed
as they intended its character
would be .
that goes even moreso for the last episode .
i hope lost
and 24 do better 
with their series finale .
