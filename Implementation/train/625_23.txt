i was not going to watch this show .
but 
i am glad i did .
the critic of this just do not get it !
it is one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t.v at the present moment !
though ,
when the interview were done with common folk
they probably seemed useless ;
but 
put them in the mouth of animal and insect ,
and it is a laugh riot .
i laughed so hard ,
i had tear in my eye .
the pig with the baby suckling and her mother is priceless .
the husband and wife bird talking about health problem ,
and the male bird taking a crap
after the wife said
she was constipated completely oke me up !
creature comfort is the most imaginative show
i have ever seen in awhile !
hopefully 
it will be back next summer
when this run is over .
