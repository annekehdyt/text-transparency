this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick ,
it is not going to win any award and its not very original
but it delivers the good you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie .
our man dolph is an ex soldier
who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school
and when it gets taken over by terrorist its up
to him to save the day .
sure the script is not going to win any oscar its good fun
and it has its fair share eplosive action .
dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance
but he comes alive more in the action scene ,
and the rest of the cast are not the best actor
but they hold it well .
all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick ,
but youv'e seen it a million time before .
