anyone
who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly ,
i would refer them to roger ebert 's review of this movie .
he is one of the most respected critic in the industry ,
and he gave
it 3 1/2 stars.this is a great movie .
it may not be perfect 
or spectacular ,
but i enjoyed it .
a chorus line is not so much a story ,
as it is a group of story about the life of broadway hopefuls .
i read review where person said
that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie .
that is an incorrect view .
it is another story along with all the other story
that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls .
what person fail to realize is that those
who are dancer for broadway show go through the same thing
that the common man goes through .
and that i think is really the point of the whole show .
it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancer ,
but to give us some poignant thing
to think about in regard to life in general .
this is a study of life as a broadway star .
anyone
who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watch this movie with a great feeling of relationship
because they have gone through exactly
what the character are going through .
this is a great musical .
it has its slow point ,
and at time gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story line ,
but all in all 
i thoroughly enjoyed it .
take a closer look at the movie ,
and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about .
