this movie is some of the worst crap i
have ever seen .
i literally got a sharp pain in my head
while watching this movie .
the cgi was awful ,
and the story was just a waste of ink .
dean cain 's character was mr-super-intuitive-i-can-figure-out-anything ,
except he can not seem to work his own helicopter correctly .
the biggest problem was the split screen camera work .
i felt
like i was watching the brady bunch or something ,
only it was not different person in the box ,
just close up and different view of the same thing .
i can only figure
that the actor really needed the money ,
because this movie was not worth the film
it was shot on .
