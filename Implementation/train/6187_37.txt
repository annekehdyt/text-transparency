... head 
hand 
and foot - a band from the past 
just like strange fruit .
a triple whammy there .
those
who have professed not to like this film
are either heartless or under 40 ,
and have had no experience of the real thing .
sad for them .
this is an achingly well-observed little picture
that is an excellent way
of passing an hour or two ,
and will probably not even fade much on the second showing .
stephen rae 
timothy spall as the fat drummer
( in many way quite the most delightful figure of all ) ,
and bill nighy - a new name for me
- as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performance ,
and juliet auey has lovely doe eye to go with some sharp acting as karen ,
who tries to hold the band together
as they spectacularly self-destruct.the syd barrett/brian wilson echo are loud and clear 
mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness ,
and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute .
do not compare this with spinal tap or the rutle or the full monty -
it is unfair on all of them .
the nearest comparison is the commitment ,
and that is no bad thing .
and any film
that can conjure up memory of blodwyn pig - a band i
do not remember ever seeing ,
but the name lives on - well ,
it shows somebody in the team knew
what they were on about.a small delight ,
and thank for the memory.oh ... and i have got another one - stiff little finger ;
a-a-and what about steeleye span ... spooky tooth ... ten inch nail anyone ?
( you have to see the movie or have been on the road )
