what has ireland ever done to film distributer
that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way ?
this movie begins like a primer for film student on irish cinematic clich :
unctuous priest 
spitting before handshake 
town square cattle mart ,
cycling by country meadow to the backdrop of anodyne folk music .
quickly 
however 
it becomes apparent
that the main theme of the film is the big daddy-o of irish clich - religous strife .
it concerns a protestant woman
who wants to decide where her catholic-fathered child is educated ,
which would seem like a reasonable enough wish 
though not to the '50 's county wexford villager
she has to live with .
rather than send them to a catholic school ,
she decides to up and leave for belfast 
then scotland ,
where a few more clich are reguritated .
while she is there ,
her father
( who looks eerily like george lucas )
and family back home are subjected to a boycott ,
which turns very nasty .
i am not going to give away the ending ,
not because i think
person should go see this movie ,
but because it is not very interesting .
one of the problem with the film is the central character :
we are supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life .
the villager are presented
as bigot whose prejudice should be stood up to ,
but traumatising your kid seems an innappropriate way
to go about it .
in addition 
it takes on burden
which it staggers igniminiously
under when it tries to draw analogy with the current northern ireland peace process :
the woman is told by her lawyer
that she `` must lay down precondition '' for her return .
the film is allegedly based on a true story
but it is theme have been dealt with much more imaginatively 
and with less recourse to hackneyed clich 
in the past .
