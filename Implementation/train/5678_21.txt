a major moneymaker for rko radio 
bombardier star pat o'brien and randolph scott as trainer at a school for bomber pilot .
o'brien and scott argue over teaching method ,
while their student vie for the affection of anne shirley .
o'brien 's method prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo .
scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese ,
but the mortally wounded scott manage to set fire to a gas truck ,
providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardier .
stylistically 
bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war film 
with moment of subtle poignancy
( the death of trainee eddie albert )
alternating with scene of ludicrous `` yellow peril '' melodrama
( the japanese literally hiss through their tooth
as they torture the helpless american ) .
though it can not help but seem dated today ,
bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort
( the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan ,
who 'd actually been appearing before the camera since 1940.anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film
