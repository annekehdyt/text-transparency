wow .
the only person
reviewing this positively
are the carpenter apologist .
i know a lot of those .
the guy
that 'll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid
and pinch out a movie and proclaim
it a masterwork of horror .
this `` movie '' is utter crap .
it looks and sounds like a porno
( good lord ,
the soundtrack is awful ... ) ,
and has sub-par porn acting ,
which is shocking ,
because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor .
i honestly have no idea
what carpenter was thinking
when making this .
most likely `` bean 
bean 
bean.. '' until somebody fed him
and rolled him up into a blanket for the day ...
they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever ,
when they could have had a very interesting central theme
( how do religious zealot anti-abortionist feel
when it is the devil 's baby ? )
but instead they chose to have ron perlman
and his terribly acted kid kill a bunch of person
and have the horribly cast doctor try
to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl .
not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed .
it is just awful .
like 
plan 9 from outerspace awful .
like 
good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful .
try watching this and the thing in the same day
and your mind will implode .
