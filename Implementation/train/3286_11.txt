just read the original story
which is written by pu in 18th century .
strikingly 
the movie despict the original spirit very well ,
though the plot was modified tremendously .
the film language 
the rhythm 
the special effect are all from hollywood ,
but still there is a chinese core .
it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together .
the result is pure beauty .
