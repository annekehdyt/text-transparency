sondra locke stink in this film ,
but then she was an awful 'actress ' anyway .
unfortunately 
she drags everyone else
( including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her .
but what was clint eastwood thinking
when he agreed to star in this one ?
one read of the script should have told him
that this one was going to be a real snorer .
it is an exceptionally weak story ,
basically no story or plot at all .
add in bored 
poor acting 
even from the normally good eastwood .
there is absolutely no action except a couple argument
and as far as i was concerned ,
this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancer .
wow !
could a film be any more boring ?
i think
watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun .
a real stinker .
do not bother with this one .
