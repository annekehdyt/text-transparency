when a film is independent
and not rated ,
such as the hamilton 
i was expecting out of the norm ,
cut out your heart violence .
i know
that good movie do not always contain blood and violence ,
but i read review 
i visited the website ,
and i even convinced a few of my friend to pay $ 9.50
to see this god awful movie with me .
when there is a festival
called horrorfest ,
i am expecting horror 
not dawson creek with incestuous undertone .
my expectation were extremely low for this film ,
yet the little expectation there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw
that an hour had passed
before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someone finger .
there were too many plot hole
and left too much to the imagination .
i regret not seeing happy foot .
i think
there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the hamilton !
