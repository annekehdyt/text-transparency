we taped this
when it aired on tv back in 1995
and have waited all these year for its release ,
for it quickly became one of our family favorites .
the kid are now teen
and must have seen it a ba-zillion time ,
yet they still watch it religiously with friend .
it is timeless appeal reach across all age group
-- similar to `` grease .
`` vanessa williams is spectacular .
jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his foot .
i have noticed other commentator on this site are pretty rough on him ,
but our family gives him top rating .
( we loved his 'giant step ' number . )
marc kudisch
( as conrad )
supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical number .
and brigitta dau
( as ursula )
just flat steal the show .
probably our favorite character in the entire movie.the
one disappointment was chynna philip 's performance of kim .
part of that has to do with the writing .
kim 's role is completely one-dimensional .
complicating that 
philip 's delivery is flat 
unimaginative 
unbelievable and just plain awful .
the director should have seen
that and corrected it .
or never cast her
to begin with.overall 
though ,
the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for family of all age .
