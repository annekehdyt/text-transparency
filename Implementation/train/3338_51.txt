in all truth 
this really is not a `` movie '' so much as an extended final episode ;
by this i mean that 
had you not followed the tv series
( homicide :
life on the street )
i suspect
that you would have a hard time
following this made-for-tv movie .
having said
that 
`` homicide :
the movie '' is still a great watch .
i think
it says a lot about a television production
that every single cast member would return 
many after year of absence ,
to once again portray their character and ing closure to an incredible program .
the movie ings out that sense of `` family '' ,
not only amongst the character ,
but amongst the actor 
as well .
it is all very bitter-sweet knowing
that this will be the last time
we will see them all together again under the title of homicide .
story-wise 
i found this film somewhat lacking .
giardello 's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived ,
and i felt
his shooting could have been dealt with within the parameter of his regular position 
as leiutenant .
also 
det .
bayliss 's extreme plot twist ,
which was left hanging at series end ,
is finally resolved ,
but i 
for one 
never felt
that it needed to be ;
i enjoyed being left with a mystery
( let us recall
that the very first episode 's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run ! ) .
as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie ,
and the fact
that it even got made after h :
lot had been canceled ,
but i would not recommend it to anyone
who has not had the slightest exposure to the series .
now 
if they had just release it on dvd ...
