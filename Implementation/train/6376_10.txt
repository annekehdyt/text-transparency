this movie pretty much surprised me .
i did not have very high expectation for it
but i was wrong .
mary and rhoda was very funny and well written .
they did not spend too much time rehashing the past
so they were not relying on the success of the old tv show
to carry the movie .
overall it was very entertaining.my girlfriend commented
that this could be a weekly sit-com and i think
i might agree with her .
