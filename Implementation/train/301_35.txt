some person loved `` the aristocrat '' and other hated it ,
frequently walking out in the middle .
reaction to eddie izzard are not likely to be that extreme
-- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (
who says
he likes girl )
and has a vocabulary
that makes ,
shall we say ,
enough use of the `` f '' word
that his program would be one long beep
if presented on network television .
many of izzard 's fan are so devoted
that they see no flaw whatsoever in his performance .
on the other hand 
i thought
this show was occasionally flatter than izzard 's chest
but also more often than not funny and 
in spot 
absolutely hilarious .
he has a way of connecting reference from routine early in the show to his later routine .
he is not a story teller .
he is not a joke maker .
he is not a frenetic fantasist like robin william .
he plays around with idea ,
some of which work and some of which
-- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz 
for instance --
are completely unfunny .
he has a way 
however ,
of moving gracefully past the flopped routine and extending the one that connect .
i gave this performance a 7
and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8. but a 10 ?
no way .
