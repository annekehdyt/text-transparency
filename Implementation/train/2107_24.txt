though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb\u00e9
who wrote the original 'the vanishing '
( spoorloos )
it does have the same overall feel ,
except for that koolhoven 's style is less business-like and more lyric .
the beginning is great ,
the middle is fine ,
but the sting is in the end .
a surprise emotional ending .
as you could read in several magazine
there is some sex in the film ,
but it is done all very beautifully .
never explicit ,
but with lot of warmth and sometimes even humour .
it is a shame american film can not be as open an honoust as this one .
where dutch film tend to go just over the edge
when it comes to this subject ,
'de grot ' stay always within the boundary of good taste .
'de grot ' tell an amazing story stretched over more than 30 year .
when you will leave the cinema
you will be moved .
what can we ask more of a film ?
anyway 
this film even gives more ... .
