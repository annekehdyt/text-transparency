almost golden :
the jessica savitch storyaspect ratio :
1.33:1sound format :
stereobland 
soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america 's first female tv news anchor .
with a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster ,
but the flimsy story really was not worth the effort .
a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way
to go .
typically strong production value in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner ,
but it is all as superficial as old fluff ,
and just as engaging .
