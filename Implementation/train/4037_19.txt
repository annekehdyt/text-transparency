it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience ,
to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most .
however 
this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham
to become the next meg ryan
( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) .
her acting was overdone
and it appeared
that she was overanxious compared to her colleague
who were relaxed in their role .
this film might have been more ,
as there was suitable budget for setting 
actor and a decent story line .
my wife and i both agreed
that this was 'muck ' at the end ,
as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high !
better luck next time 
hope miss graham stick to the type of film
that she belongs in like from hell .
