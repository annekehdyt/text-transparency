i am a jean harlow fan ,
because she had star quality .
i do not think
her movie are good and i do not even think
that she was a good actress ,
but she certainly was great in comedy .
every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good .
but this movie is perhaps more like a love story .
jean harlow is wonderful in this one
and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performance ing nothing new .
it always impresses me much to think
that harlow 's beautiful body was that of an ill woman .
well 
in this movie she does look beautiful .
