although i like kurt vonnegut ,
i am not particularly interested in spy story and i did not know this one .
the only reason
i watched
it was nick nolte ,
who is one of my favorite actor
since i saw `` breakfast of champion '' and `` hotel rwanda '' .
but the film ought me a pleasant surprise .
of course nolte was great ,
but so was the plot .
there was relatively little political intrigue ,
and much more focus on the moral question :
by reading his anti-semitic radio commentary with hidden secret message to american ,
he in fact contributed to the general attitude of german
( and ,
as it later turns out 
american )
towards jew or hitler .
which carries more weight 
his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism ?
the dilemma is even more prominent
as these word are never spoken 
not even as narration .
howard campbell jr.
( nolte )
is a person
who learnt to hide his feeling so perfectly
that he does not open up 
not even in his memoirs .
the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography 
this film manages .
there are other point to it 
such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clich\u00e9s
( like the song white christmas ) ,
that make it real different from average american movie .
i recommend it to everyone
who is bored with hollywood spy movie .
