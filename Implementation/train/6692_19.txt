ohhh the utality 
ohhhhh the dying eed 
ohhhh the sense of loss 
ohhhh the prejudice !
jeez ,
when are all you whiney revisionist going to stop analyzing western for crying out loud ?
s**t happen .
if it offends your socially engineered sensibility then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection.boring 
tedious 
and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of coburn/hackman/bergen 's presence .
nothing interesting or intriguing here ,
unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty .
may have been a little better
without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth .
a monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70 's .
virtually impossible to sit through the entire film .
i think
i would rather have my eye stapled open for the entire lucky luke/trinity series .
4 horses/10-all deader'n hell .
