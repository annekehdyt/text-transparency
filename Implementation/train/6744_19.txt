this movie is a terrible waste of time .
although it is only an hour and a half long it feels
somewhere close to 4. i have never seen a movie move
so slowly
and so
without a purpose .
this is also a `` horror '' film
that takes place a lot of the time during daylight .
my friend and i laughed an insane amount of time
when we were probably supposed to be scared.the only thing
we want to know
is why such a terrible movie was released in so many country .
it can not be that high in demand .
the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling
because although she is beautiful
she lost her accent so many time in this movie ,
half of the time she is british
and half the time
she is american .
