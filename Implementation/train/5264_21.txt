this is one strange hacked together film ,
you get the feeling
that the bond company had to come in on this one ,
i am not surprised
there is no credit on it ,
who would want to be associated with this film .
the acting of all involved is terribly stilted
and the plot jump around all over ,
it all makes very little sense .
as i said
before it looks like the bond company had to come
in because it seems like there was alot of footage
that was not shot
that needed to be ,
and all the music was very ill-fitting liary music
( cheap i guess ) .
very 
very odd .
i might actually buy a dvd of it though ,
if it could let me in on what the hell was going on ,
and what happened to this movie .
