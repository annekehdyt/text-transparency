good old black and white graham greene based person in dangerous time
doing heroic and mysterious thing .
hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop
that is being minted by hollywood today .
bacall lights up the screen of course
and boyer is entirely engaging .
they do not make movie like this any more .
