6/10 acting 
not great but some good acting.4/10 director 
makes some stupid decision for this film.2/10 writer ,
story makes no sense at all
and has huge amount of flaws.4/10 overall score for this movie.do not waste your time with this film ,
it is not worth it .
i gave 4 for this movie
and it may be too much .
character are so over exaggerated
than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens `` storywise '' 
not in good way .
because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minute
( too many special effect :
slow motion and camera shake and fast forward ) .
it is always good that movie uses music
to make the story go smooth
but there is too many track in this one .
in the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialog and music
