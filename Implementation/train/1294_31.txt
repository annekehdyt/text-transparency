well 
eyeboy 
i must say
that it pleases me to no end
when someone singles me out
and try to make fun of me ,
especially when it is someone
who seems as intelligent
as you do .
my favorite part of your post was `` but no big bang-bang good-guy bad-guy here 
kimosabe .
me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang .
`` well said !
i do like action movie ,
especially if they are well done ,
but i also like movie
that do not have a whole lot of action ,
as long as they are well done .
i am sorry ,
but secret 's and ly does not fit into that category
and is simply a very bad movie .
i really do not see very many non-american film ,
so maybe i was spoiled ,
and did not realize
how bad foreign film really were
when i saw secret and ly .
perhaps if i judge foreign movie by a different standard i could some day see
how secret and ly could possibly be one of the highest rated movie on the imdb .
hmm ... if true 
that is very scary.jeremy barger bit @ midohio.net
