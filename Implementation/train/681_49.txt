apparently most viewer know nothing about the history of europe ,
including germany 
hungary and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the hitler and stalin era .
nuremberg
( and a lot of forgotten trial all over europe )
was a revenge and injustice of the winner .
what do you think ,
why were not any american 
british 
french or soviet defendant after the wwii ?
there were no american 
british etc .
war crime ?
there were no hiroshima 
no nagasaki 
no tokyo 
no dresden 
no hamburg 
no berlin 
no katyn and so on ?
the german had war crime too ,
but in nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration .
the main point was :
vae victis !
germany must perish !
( that was also a book title in america 
1941 .
) this film is an awful 
ignoble american ainwashing instrument 
full of error 
lie 
propaganda 
prejudice and injustice .
and first of all :
full of hypocrisy .
but not surprisingly ... why was not enough the nuremberg process itself ?
this film is a nightmare .
total darkness after 60 year !
this darkness
( and hate and narcissism and lack of self-criticism )
is the real cause of the massacre in korea 
vietnam 
cambodia 
serbia 
iraq and so forth .
and there are no american war criminal ... bravo 
america !
very clever .
even stalin would become envious of it ...
