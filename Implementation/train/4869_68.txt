hoo boy 
this was a real trial
to get through .
the dvd case has tom hank ' mug plastered on it
and that is the only reason
that anybody would buy it .
he looks about forty on the box 
however ,
the movie was made in 1982 ,
so he still has his bosom buddy 'do
and of course is about forty pound lighter .
the plot concerns a dungeon and dragon like game
that hank and his three friend play and hank ends up thinking
the whole thing is real .
chris makepeace is a boy genius
named jay jay and the best thing
about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hat .
ooh 
look 
he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo !
now he is dressed like a wwi pilot !
this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way .
a bunch of vet pop up mostly as parent of the kid .
there is anne
( i am honey west 
dammit ! )
francis and louise sorel ,
who actually looks kind of hot .
murray hamilton 
the mayor from jaws 
has a thankless roll as a cop .
wendy crewson 
is the love interest for hank and some blonde guy i have never seen before or since .
there is some syrupy music here
and there
and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement .
there is a monster
that only hank can see
because he is ,
you know 
nut .
the monster is played by the late 
great kevin peter hall ,
he of predator fame .
a friend of mine got this out of the ol ' discount bin at mallwart
and advised me to chuck it in the trash
without even looking at it ,
so naturally i had to see
if it was as bad as all that .
it was .
the night before 
i watched apollo 13 ,
so after that 
this movie was a bit of a shock .
do yourself a favor
and leave it in the bin .
oh yeah 
after hank almost jump from one of the world trade center tower
because of his delusion ,
he goes home to recuperate
and is visited by his friend .
hank mother 
a drunken vera mile 
says
he is coming along nicely now
but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit ,
he is crazier than ever .
the end
