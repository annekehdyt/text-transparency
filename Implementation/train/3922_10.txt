this movie should be required viewing for all liarian or would-be liarian .
all of the best line are directly related to liarianhip .
the public liary vs. academic liary argument is a classic argument waged among liarian and liary school student .
it also eaks many liarian stereotype .
liarian might even be capable of having fun
-- even if they do not *usually* have sex in the romance languages section !
( the best movie about liarian ?
desk set 
with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy 
of course . )
