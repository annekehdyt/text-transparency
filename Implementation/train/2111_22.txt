cutter 
leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple
and is captured by the thuggee lead by the sinister guru .
gunga din 
the regiment 's water boy 
goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeant go after him ,
but are also captured .
now the major sends a full detail out after the three ,
but do not realize
that they are walking into a trap set by the thugee .
it is though 
gunga din
who saves the day .
excellently made buddy film ,
even though it is today politically incorrect .
grant 
mclaglen 
and fairbank do give very humorous and thrilling performance with jaffe very well in the title role and cianelli very sinister as guru .
rating- 10/10 .
