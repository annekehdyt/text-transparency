just the kind of movie i love .
some very good british actor as well as the one and only sharon stone .
catherine tramell
( stone )
masterfully manipulates a well educated group of person 's life ,
playing on their frailty
to collect experience
to write a murder mystery book .
she plays the female psychopath quite well
while using her ample sex appeal
to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widow .
tramell is use to dark place within society and freely partake in sadomasochistic fling in the 'never visit after dark ' side of town .
from the beginning 
there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone .
stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter 
an emotionless femme fatal
without the meal plan .
