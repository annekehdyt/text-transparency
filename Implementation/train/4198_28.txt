my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiment
found in the film .
in fact 
they are quite congruent with mine .
what gets me is the fact
that in term of a movie 
it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story 
motive or dialogue .
maybe someone should tell neal
that substituting lyric of song
which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience
is not the same thing
as creating character
who are motivated to speak
because of event
created by the writer or director .
a silly narrative remain as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young .
the most childish scene is the one
where the devil dances his way into a bar ,
slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero ,
who then finds his way onto the dance floor
to mouth the word to young song to the heroine ,
who is unaware of what is taken place .
somehow these two dream up a scheme
where they will go up the west coast in search of ? ? ? ? ?
sorry neal 
stick with music and leave film
making to steven still .
