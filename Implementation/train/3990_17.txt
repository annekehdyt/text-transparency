eric rohmer 's 'the lady and the duke ' is based on the journal of an english aristocrat
who lived through the french revolution .
but it is a stilted affair ,
with its strange 
painted backdrop and mannered conversational tone .
most notably 
this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action ;
one sees very little of ordinary person in this movie 
and little of the chaos 
poverty and terror
that unfolded away from the drawing room of the persecuted 
but spoilt 
aristocratic class .
the result is frequently dull ,
and ultimately unenlightening about the force
that sometimes drive society to the ink of destruction ;
it is a disappointing film from an acclaimed director .
