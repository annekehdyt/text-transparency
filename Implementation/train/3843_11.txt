you can do a lot with a little cash .
blair witch proved that .
this film supports it .
it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity .
however ,
because it has john cleese as sherlock holme it manages to be hilarious even on a budget
that could not afford a shoestring .
the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere 
bumbling watson 
his dimness and slowness foil cleese 's quick-tempered wit .
if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two .
