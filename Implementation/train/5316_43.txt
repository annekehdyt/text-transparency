especially 
of course 
the two leading character .

walter matthau plays oscar 
his friend 
an untidy 
unreliable sports-reporter
who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartmant .
he offers his distressed friend felix a new home in his apartmant .
and soon the trouble begins
because two such contrary character can not live together for a long time .
felix turns
oscar 's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat .
he cleans and cooks the whole time .
after a short while 
oscar feel persecution mania ... filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted .
above all 
jack lemmon 's play is wonderful .
he is the perfect clown .
he makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way .
look for the wonderful scene
when both man invite their two female neighbour for supper ,
because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball .
while he is preparing the drink ,
felix sit with the two young lady in the living-room .
to get out of this embarrassing situation ,
he starts to talk about the weather .
a minute later 
he changes the subject and talk about his ex-wife and child .

when oscar comes back with the drink ,
there are three weeping person in the living-room .
the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scene .
an intelligent 
entertaining comedy with much heart .
10/10 !
