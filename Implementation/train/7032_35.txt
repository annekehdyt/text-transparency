after a quasi-gothic 
all-fruity music video 
the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself .
in a perfect world
that would be that
and the end credit would roll .
we do not live n that world .
the insipid band member decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence .
when i say clown ,
i mean actual clown .
he tell them
they are all going to die via cassidy 's ghost
( the spirit possesses dora 
one of the band-mate )
we could not care less
as the character are all boring 
vapid 
and extremely horribly acted .
written by adam hackbarth
( an incredibly apropos surname
if there ever was one ) ,
and directed by corbin timook
( who after the attendant ,
and tower of blood ,
has to know
that he keeps making crap for a living ) ,
this movie s a constant battle between the film 's incompetence and the viewer 's need
to stay awake .
not enough blood to appease gore-hound ,
nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs .
this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone.my grade :
