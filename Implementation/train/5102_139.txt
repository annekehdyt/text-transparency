is not anyone else tired of that old clich\u00e9 ' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film ,
gives us some information ,
and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason ?
i know
i am.the sad thing is that
it is use in this film
is worthless .
if you have seen the first film
( the first remake i should say )
then the information given is completely worthless ,
because you would have already known it .
i guess 
you can
that it is not worthless to the main character..but
then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head ?
would not he want to live ?
sure 
he would have
died anyway..this is the second film
to be titled `` the hill
have eye ii . ''
the first being the sequel to the original 70 's film .
this is where
it gets a little complicated
for someone like me .
see 
i am probably part of minority of person my age
that
even knew
there was a hhe2
to begin with 
much less an original hhe1 .
and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact
that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original hhe1 ...
it just makes it worse !
but anyways..wes craven 's original hill have eye was decent .
in the end 
though 
the idea was better than the presentation ,
but he most likely had a low budget .
to be quite honet ,
wes craven is not that good of a horror director .
he is only made a few good horror movie
( nightmare on elm st. 
new nightmare ) ,
a few alright one
( scream )
and a bunch of horrible one
( cursed 
shocker 
vampire in brooklyn ) .
oh yeah ,
and he made swamp thing 
as well ...
but the original hhe2 falls under the latter category .
i have only seen a few minute ,
but it was terrible.now
he has co-written the new hhe2..and
it is such a disappointment !
last year 's hhe remake was even better than the original film .
it was tense .
i guess
it had to do with the fact
that the main character were a family 
and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenager .
it made us feel dirty .
for the first hour 
we were in hell ,
and finally in the last few moment 
the good guy got revenge on the bad guy
and it felt
good..this new film has no tension .
no suspense whatsoever .
just violent thing happening to mostly stupid person .
there is hardly any menacing presence here .
just ugly hobos hiding under rocks.i am getting tired of horror movie where person die
because of the stupid mistake
they keep making .
it was just the other day
that i watching `` deep blue sea ''
where samuel l. jackson kept on walking around the water ,
while giving the speech ,
and then he gets eaten by a shark ,
only because the idiot stayed to close to the water..something
that nobody would do in the given situation !
here is the exact same thing .
person go off by themselves
to take a leak
even though
they know person
are dying..seriously ,
could not a potty eak wait ?
and then
when you think
person would have learned ,
someone else goes of by themselves !
seriously 
is not more scary
when the character are inging their a-game
and still losing ?
i would think
so ... it even under deliver .
it should have made the first remake look like `` the fog '' remake
( which was less menacing than an episode of `` becker '' ) .
more bad guy .
more time in the cave .
more tension .
more of everything.but it actually downgrades .
less bad guy .
no tension .
sure we have more time in the cave ,
but not a whole lot happens there .
in the end 
it only seems like there is two or three bad guy .
the last film made
it seem like a whole tribe of person .
where is this tribe ?
who keeps on watching them through binocular ?
seriously 
these are the thing
this film should have ought us ,
but it ends with the exact same promise
that the last film gave us ,
with that exact same `` being watched '' scene .
come on !
i will give the devil
it is due .
the look of the film is good..but
that it.i do not even think fan of gore will like this..though i am probably wrong !
there is gore
( though most of it is sped-up while in the dark ) ,
but without the tension ,
and character you even care about..the gore does nothing in my book !
in the end 
you are not frightened .
you ; re not shocked
( unless you are an 8 year old girl ) .
you do not even feel
like you have seen anything new .
