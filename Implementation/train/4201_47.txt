three teenage girl in an incomplete triangular relation .
the base of the triangle is barely there .
at the apex is marie 
a serious 
short and lean tomboy with a belmondo-like facial structure .
her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite :
coquette 
chubby --
i dare say fat --
and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter .
because of her chubbiness 
boy do not seem interested
and it pains her.the other leg of the apex is a beautiful `` fille fatale '' blonde vamp .
she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming
performing at competitive level .
marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool .
marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp
using the desire
to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument .
the vamp has a reputation
of being a whore ,
making out with any young male
that orbits around her .
marie is not phased out by that reputation .
put a stress on reputation.the first half is set up .
we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming
as we become familiar with the three girl .
eventually the narrative leaf synchronized swimming behind and concentrate on the topsy-turvy relation among the three .
that is when unexpected thing start to happen.it is a trademark of french film
to drop nugget of wisdom on the viewer .
this one is no exception .
here it is about ceiling and the dying .
see the film
to learn more.the director
says
that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful .
that women-only sport is a metaphor for a girl 's life :
pretty and feminine on the surface
while hard working and competitive underneath .
a number of scene drive this point :
elegant move and smile for the public ,
legs kicking ungainly underwater .
the title in french is also suggestive :
`` prieuve '' 
or octopus 
suggest an individual
having to juggle many pressure simultaneously .
