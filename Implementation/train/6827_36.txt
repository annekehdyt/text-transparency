i do not know
what some of you are smoking ,
but i suspect
it is potent.to call swept away awful
would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness .
the acting is hideous and i am not picking on madonna here ,
we all know
she is useless ,
but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious .
my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered line .
the editing is so sloppy ,
it beggars description .
the photography and composition
( which in this era ,
competence should be a given for any film with a budget )
are astonishingly inept ,
even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking .
these are basic element of filmmaking ,
if you can not get them right ,
you should seek another line of work .
it is as contrived as a grade 3 production of snow white ,
except nowhere near
as well made or interesting.the original film by lina wertmueller
is a wonderful satire and metaphor 
superbly acted and written ,
featuring eathtaking visual -
you can practically taste the sea salt
and feel the windswept sand in your hair .
the sexual tension feel real and immediate ...
those of you
who found guy ritchie 's version deplorable ,
should see it ,
it really is one of the landmark of world cinema.those of you
who thought
the remake is some kind of masterpiece
should have your head examined .
