the real irony is this :
joe besser was a top notch comedian 
in other situation away from the stooge .
he had a definite track record
for being very funny and clever .
moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many year and liked his work .
so what on earth was going on
when he joined the troop as the `` third stooge '' ?
obviously 
nothing .
in most of these `` late stooge '' era short 
more often than not 
the boy are pitted against each other or joe against the other two
and this is not accurate stooge etiquette .
`` one for all 
all for one 
every man for himself '' 
to quote curly from `` restless knight '' .
one thing about a good comedy team 
laurel and hardy 
abbott and costello 
the marx brother 
no matter
how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around ,
when the chip are actually down ,
they stick together
and come to each other 's aid .
in this particular one 
none of that happens .
it is almost like watching a dog fight
as one tries to cheat the other
or be mean and nasty ,
and not for comedic effect either .
one might assume
that there was something behind the scene
going on here 
art imitates life .
maybe there really was hence
why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry .
just look at the history of the other team
and tell me i am wrong .
