# 1 amitabh 's son ,
played by akshaye khanna ,
is 30.amitabh 's been in prison for 33+ year ... hea )
telepathically transmitted the sperm home ? b )
asked a nice pakistani guard to mail it for him ? c )
they allow conjugal visit in secret pakistani jailsd )
all of the abovee )
the producer were having a little too much bhang atthe time

amrita rao
( yummm ! )
wants khanna - he is yum 
yum 
yummy ...
and apparently he wants her -
who would not 
right ? ! ...
but 
when her dad gets ratted out ,
and then killed
( i hardly think
this is a 'spoiler '
as you would have to be ain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film )
he is pretty emotionless toward this catastrophe and with the tip
( metaphorically )
of his hat 
leaves her behind to save his dad ,
never mind her loss ,
and says
( paraphrasing )
`` if god wills it ,
we will meet again '' ...
basically meaning 
`` i am gon na get my dad and my job done ,
sorry for your loss - cya !
buh bye ! ''
- callus beyond even low-life hollywood standard ... # 3 )
there are so many hole in this horrible waste of time
called a movie ,
that you can drive all the jeep 
truck camel and any extra stuff through it .
pass - really 
complete and total waste of time - oh !
there is a great dance sequence
( yes 
only one - as in dance sequence -
regardless of quality )
great belly dancing - but not worth
watching just for this.rent veer-zaara or lakshya
( will hrithik roshan ever take acting lesson ? )
for better indo-pak conflict movie ... in fact 
veer-zaara is pretty damned good -
7.5/8 i would say !
