i thought
this was an utterly charming film .
the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john water :
pecker 's greatest gift is his ability
to find beauty in unexpected place .
edward furlong does well in the lead ,
but the best performance are by his grandmother 
mink stole
( a hilarious cameo )
and 
of all person 
patty hearst .
i think
the reviewer are way off base on this one .
they seem to be taking pecker 's worst valuation of his work as gospel ,
when i think
the film pretty clearly states
that he is indeed a promising artist .
