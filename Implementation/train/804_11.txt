the movie gets to the gut of the tension between a son and a father.the illiant dialog 
lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way
to present the onion
that keeps peeling back layers.the core issue of parenting ,
communication and manhood are explored indirectly.in
fun way
the curtain is pulled back ,
the mask slip off a little and truth are exposed.all of this happens amidst a road trip format .
the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall
just as the tree are changing color .
wow !
