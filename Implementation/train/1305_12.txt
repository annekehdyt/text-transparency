that this show had been cancelled.ity only lasted one year.i
just recently started watching it and i love it.it a show
that could of gone as far as friend went.it had the humour
and was extremely enjoyable.it is about 2 other and 2 sister
living under one roof
without their parents.kurt

plays the part of the oldest sibling
and takes on the more fatherly role.this should of lasted much more than year
as it was fantastic .
amazing show with all the best actors.10/10
