it is great to see jorja fox in a role
where she gets to smile a lot .
also loved hearing her sing .
nice change to see her out of her csi/west wing/er role .
the movie itself was entertaining ,
but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of part .
several of the character seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next
and it was left up to your imagination
to figure out why .
each character was quirky though and in some case ,
i could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next .
this movie was not full of squeaky clean person 
but rather complicated realistic person
who could make mistake ,
feel bad about them
and then find a way
to fix them .
