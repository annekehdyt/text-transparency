my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandel 's show.. i also like shatner -
even when he is at his most pathetic..but this is absolutely the worst show on television.please cancel this show .
it sucks a**.the only positive thing i can say
is that the girl are hotter on this show
and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no deal ...
the question are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure .
and watching shatner or the contestant say
`` show me the money '' makes me want to vomit..this one will not last .
