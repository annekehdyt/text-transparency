this is a very odd film ...
i was not really sure
what is was about 
some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the wood
that
they all believe
is some kind of oracle
and somehow makes them all 
in their own way 
change something about their life
that usually ends in disaster .
the film
ended after about 90 minute
leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied 
almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all .
i did not care about any of the character -
none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer.what
was the message ?
am i being dim ?
it was just too odd .
what happens to runner ?
why does emilio shoot the kid ?
...
that made absolutely no sense 
pointless .
can someone help me understand this mess of a film ?
