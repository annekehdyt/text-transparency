i caught this movie late at night on cable ,
and i was pleasantly surprised .
i can only imagine the reason
this movie was not better known ,
is because the subject matter is very disturbing .
but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic ,
it is a well acted 
suspenseful and very interesting movie .
both richard gere and claire daine are very good in it .
and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart ,
the movie does not go out of its way
to be utal
either
( like 8mm for instance )
.i highly recommend it to anyone
who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movie .
