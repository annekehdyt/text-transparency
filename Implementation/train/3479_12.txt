i read somewhere
that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movie
and leave the classic alone .
we can only hope .
while this remake was not a total waste ,
i still wish
i had the six buck back
to go toward a dvd of the original .
lot of violence and one of the worst ending i
have ever seen .
this version does not add anything new .
it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone .
