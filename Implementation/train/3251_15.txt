split second might have been a good movie .
a story about a `` road rage '' homicide 
has a very young clive owen
giving a pretty good performance ;
but ... but ... .unfortunately 
the filmmaker undercut their own movie with idiotic camera-work and truly awful editing .
the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt
( i suppose )
to reflect owen 's stress from business 
family 
and traffic .
what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache.since the filmmaker cared nothing
about making a good movie ,
but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography ,
one ought not waste time on this travesty .
