a good film with strong performance
( especially the two lead ) .
the film is about two american girl
who are caught with 6 kilo 's heroin on an airport in thailand .
they are both thrown in prison and one of them sign a confession .
bill pullman plays the lawyer
who tries to get them out .
all they have to do is find a nick parks
who put the narcotic in the bag of one of the two girl .
so far for the story
which is not that original
( it has many resemblance with the better return to paradise )
.the acting and newton thomas sigel 's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch .
a 7/10 .
