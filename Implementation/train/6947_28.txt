this series got me into deighton 's writing and the genre
when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story .
i would however disagree with the above comment .
from what i have read in the past ,
it is not holm 's performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering
that all three book received in the translation to the screen .
a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing
that ended samson 's field career .
the scene is not in the book 
the character
who dies in the minefield
was never in any of the book and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany 
not the polish frontier .
this whole storyline is cloth .
the change in set similarly damage the integrity of the story .
my perspective on holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife 's defection excellently and i believe
comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately
trying to idge the class divide .
samson both pay for his father 's idealism and suffer due to its influence on his life .
as clevemore comment 
had he gotten himself an education
he would have probably been running the department .
i think
the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything .
holm is diminutive
when compared to the samson of the book - a physically impressive man
capable of using his size
to impose a presence .
