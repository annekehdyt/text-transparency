granted i had seen some `` speed racer '' ,
but i never really watched it
and i had also seen other show some featuring these character
dressed as bird
who flew a ship
called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship
that looked like a giant ocean vessel
and it flew backward at time for some reason
and was really dark and hard to understand for someone
who was maybe five .
this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it .
it actually ended ,
the bad guy
done in unlike nearly every american cartoon
where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformer
that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing
to get the autobot 
dungeon and dragon with the kid
never making it home ,
with gi joe with coa still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth .
this one did end
and did feature a rather cool robot
that got new weapon as the show progressed ,
it was a bit bland
to begin with as it could not fly
and had only a few really cool weapon .
as it went on
he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16
used against cell in dragonball z ,
then that weapon evolved to include razor
that shot out .
then the big robot even got wing so
he could fly
and even more weapon were incorporated into the wing .
he would also get a couple of ally in a female robot and a rather funny one
called bobo in america .
the villain not only consisted of dr. hell 
but a really weird person
that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head .
interesting show
and it was kind of nice
seeing a conclusion .
