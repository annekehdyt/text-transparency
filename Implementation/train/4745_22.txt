with no fault to the actor
( they all put on great performance ) ,
the overall story was not very well executed .
the movie opens with a great zinger :
a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl 's car off the road .
but then 
we are forced to endure 40 minute of character development with an entirely new group of character ...
and we do not know
why until the 40 minute are up .
it turns out
that they are the one
who eventually discover the girl 's body ... and the story progresses from there.while the story does pick up at that point ,
it really goes nowhere .
after 2 hour ,
i asked myself :
was there a point to this ,
or was it just to see the character struggle with accusation of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery ?
the story was ultimately unsatisfying
and felt unfinished .
while it is well acted ,
there is not a strong enough backbone in the film
to warrant recommending it .
