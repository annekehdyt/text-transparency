i sat down to watch this movie with my friend with very low expectation .
my expectation were no where near low enough .
i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it ,
and if it was a comedy ,
the humor was completely missed .
the plot was nonexistent
and the acting was horrendous .
my friend and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minute of this film
before we turned it off
and promptly begged the video store
to take it back .
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movie of all time .
i honestly do not know
how this film lasted more than a day in theatre and moreover i can not understand
why anyone would willing watch it ,
considering not only it is very uninteresting title
but also the lack of any famous actors/actress in it is cast .
this review is not a joke and i honestly think
this could possibly be the worst movie ever made .
it is certainly the worst movie i have ever had to sit through .
