chilling 
majestic piece of cinematic fright 
this film combines all the great element of an intellectual thriller 
with the grand vision of a director
who has the instinctual capacity
to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius
that includes an eye for the original shot 
an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization .
this movie cuts through all the typical horror movie like a red-poker through a human eye ,
as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist ,
but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems .
one of the scariest thing for person to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting
with just that thought in mind .
the setting is perfect 
in a desolate winter hideaway .
the quietness of the moment is a character in itself 
as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrance 's mind wallows in this idle time 
and eeds the devil 's new playground .
i always felt
like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our mind 
with only the circumstance of the moment ,
and the reason
given therein ,
needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victim .
this film is a perfect example of this very thought.and
it is within this film 's subtle touch of the canvas ,
the clackity-clack of the young boy 's big wheel riding along the empty hallway of the hotel 
the labyrinthian garden
representing the mind 's fine line between sane and insane 
kuick 's purposely transfixed editing inconsistency 
continuity error and set mis-arrangement ,
that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible ,
but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown .
i have never read the book upon
which the film is based ,
but
without that as a comparison point ,
i am proud to say
that this is one of the most terrifying film
that i have ever seen .
i thought
that the runtime of the film could have been cut by a little bit 
but then again ,
i am not one of the most acclaimed director in the history of film ,
so maybe i should keep my two-cent criticism over a superb film 
to myself .
all in all 
this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ,
ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction ,
and ty you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man 's mind gone overboard 
creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.rating :
9/10
