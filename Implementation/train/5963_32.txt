ok ,
so obviously ppl thought
this was a good movie in 1955.i pity the fool
who still think
so ... its absolute rubbish.the story is just ... ridiculous .
the character are absurd caricature -
but this film is not meant to satirise ,
im sure its meant to be a serious drama
is not it ?
dean and other 
are too old for their part .
person say
dean is great in this film ,
and well ,
maybe he did play his part as well
as he possibly could have .
his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so .
but dean was a 24 year old man
when he made this film .
seeing him agonise and throw little tantrum like a 4 year old boy ... its pathetic.natalie wood is gorgeous ,
but the early scene at the police station
where she is crying and whining
are very unconvincing .
it sets a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest of it ,
you feel like cringing every time
one of these badly acted emotional scene
comes
along.it may 've been good for its time 
but 
really 
its drivel.it must 've just been hype about dean 's death
that has over-inflated the reputation of this film .
