i have only had the luxury
of seeing this movie
once
when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred
in trying to remember it .
however 
i can say
it was not as funny as a movie
called killer tomato
should have been and the most memorable thing from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple
talking about poor timmy .
other than that the movie is really just scene of little tomato and big tomato rolling around
and person
acting scared and overacting
as person should do in a movie of this type .
however ,
just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song
do not a good comedy make .
granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie ,
nothing to be taken seriously 
however ,
you should still make joke
that are funny
and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie .
perhaps a short would have been fine
as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately
trying to gun down a larger tomato
was actually pretty good .
the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer ,
but no they indeed made a full movie ,
and a rather weak one at that .
