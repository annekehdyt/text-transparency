i saw this in the market place at the canne film festival .
it is a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that
but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both .
think larry cohen .
sean young is an interesting actor -
well done to the producer for hooking her i guess.the opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious -
you could picture all the crew hands shaking
it around !
ha ha -
but i wish the person
who made this well - at least it is not pretentious .
