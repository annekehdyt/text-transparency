the new batman adventure
( also called gotham knight )
takes place 5 year after the final episode of batman :
the animated series
( b :
ta )
and only aired for 24 episode .
this is not a horrible show ,
but it just is not as good as the original batman animated series .
i will start with all the thing
that i found not to be very good.first thing 's first 
the animation itself :
long and sweet 
gotham is not dark anymore ,
the sky is always ight red and orange 
b :
ta did this also ,
but it was drawn on a dark palate ,
do the colour of the sky was more ominous 
in this show 
the colour of the sky is too ight .
it all just look like any other kid show
and does not seem unique like batman :
ta did with it is dark 
cool art style on gotham .
the art style is ok ,
but does not remind me of batman anymore .
every character is comprised of straight line 
square ,
and triangle making character look less human-like .
in the original series
( b :
ta ) ,
character look more like drawn version of real person .
the animation may be more consistent here than in b :
ta ,
but it definitely is not as good .
next :
some of the episode seem too dumbed down and childish ,
but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b :
ta .
( two-face attempting to kill tim drake/robin 2 ,
and some villain get some pretty harsh treatment ) .
this leads me to my next point.because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episode of the batman animated universe ,
many villain do meet their demise or leave forever .
poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes ; two-face nearly kill penguin 
killer croc 
and himself ,
so he is moved to arkham forever ;
joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant
( though he will return later on the justice league animated series ) ;
catwoman moves away to france leaving batman 
etc ...
just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great character !
the villain ' motive are pretty bad 
too .
there are none !
in b : ta 
we learn
that these villain are mentally tormented and their life are ruined ,
that is why
they act the way
they do ,
in this show 
the villain are just committing crime
to progress the story .
it is like batman just does not even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the person
that he fights ,
he just beats them senseless .
this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character ,
but
since he is been doing this job for year ,
i can see
why he is so harsh .
next 
the redesigned character model :
they are awful .
gordon slimmed down about 100 pound ... is he sick ?
many villain look stupid
( joker 
riddler 
catwoman 
mr. freeze 
mad hatter ,
and killer croc are among the worst ) .
although 
i do think
that some character look better
( bane 
scarecrow 
batgirl ) .
harley is about the same 
and ivy
( who is even hotter now )
has pale green skin.with the series
having many fault ,
some episode are great- over the edge 
mad love 
beware the creeper 
girl night out 
old wound 
legend of the dark knight ,
and never fear are my favourite one here 
in my opinion .
all of the crossover featuring batman in the superman animated series were great ,
also.the absolute worst part about this show is how the creator say
they love the animation of this series more than the original .
on the dvd feature of the original batman animated series 
they talk
about how proud they were with the art style ,
and how difficult some character were to animate ,
but they did eventually succeed with ( the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface 
for example ) .
on the dvd feature of the new batman adventure 
the creator basically say `` to hell with b :
ta 
this is a fresh 
new re-vamp ,
it look better
and we love
how we nearly ruined the series ! ''
( alright ,
that is an exaggeration ) .
when the creator cast away the amazing art style of b :
ta ,
that really annoyed me !
it is not a bad show ,
but i still do not like it as much as the original animated series .
at least the show does not talk down to its audience ,
so for that reason 
i still commend it .
though some of the episode in this new series are fantatic
and worth watching .
superman :
the animated series 
and justice league :
the animated series are great follow-up show to batman :
the animated series and the new batman adventure 
so give them a watch as well .
