the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery .
this movie was long and boring .
the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teaching
he proclaimed .
how many time can his boy take the lord 's name in vain in this film
being from a presbyterian background ?
it does not fit .
i wished paul was swept down the river
without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly 
smirkish 
selfish story of paul
( brad pitt ) .
so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler
who norm wants to rescue
but does not-so what .
it is very uninteresting .
we see the prejudiced white being stood up to by paul
because of his native american girl .
that was the only part
that had some interest
and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western ' .
what we only see is a sleepy town
where the two minister 's son have nothing to do but 1. norm chase a lame girlfriend
and deal with her family and 2.paul make up dumb story at the newspaper shop
while scratching his head
and take a lot of swig
and tie a lot of fly .
i would rather watch a show about fishing
that that film again-which will be never .
