i was so looking forward to seeing this
when it was in production.but it turned out
to be the the biggest let down .
a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss .
it was vulgar and distasteful i do not think
dr seuss would have approved.how the grinch stole christmas was much better .
i understand
it had some subtle adult joke
in it but my child have yet to catch on .
whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity
they caught a lot more than i would have liked.growing up with dr seuss
it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .let
see what they do with horton hears a who.i hope
this one does dr seuss some justice .
