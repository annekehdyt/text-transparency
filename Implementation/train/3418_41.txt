stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd
( a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell )
gets dumped on a desolate remote planet
after he is deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum
( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs ) ,
who has todd and his fellow soldier replaced with a new advanced eed of genetically engineered combatant .
todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcast
and has to defend this community
when the new soldier arrive for a field exercise .
director paul w.s .
anderson ,
working from a smart and provocative script by david webb people ,
depicts a chilling vision of a bleak 
cold and harsh possible near future
while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough 
gritty tone throughout .
moreover 
anderson handle moving moment of humanity well
( todd 's struggle
to get in touch with his previously repressed feeling
is genuinely poignant )
and stages the stirring action scene with rip-roaring gusto .
russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd ;
he conveys a lot of emotion
without saying much
and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movement and facial expression .
bang-up
supporting turn by jason scott lee
as utish rival soldier caine 607 
connie nielson as the compassionate sandra 
sean pertwee as the kindly mace 
jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan 
gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church 
michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig 
and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkin .
better still 
this film makes a profound and significan not statement about the spiritual cost
of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might .
david tattersall 's polished cinematography 
joel mcneely 's rousing full-bore orchestral score ,
and the first-rate rate special effect all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hyid outing .
