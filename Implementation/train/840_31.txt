this is one of those movie
that you and a bunch of friend sit around drinking beer ,
eating pizza 
and laugh at .
unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone .
my friend and i rented a big block of movie
and never got around to seeing this one .
it was due back
and i figured
that it was a waste not to watch it .
so i did ,
and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is.now 
i love bad movie quite a bit ,
and i probably would have liked this one
if the `` hero '' was not so utterly loathsome .
the entire movie i was hoping
that he had put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him !
he does very little heroic thing in the movie .
he is a beefy 
disgusting 
stupid thing .
he has less redeeming quality than the villain do .
and what was it with all the naked chick ?
i mean 
i love naked chick just as much as the next guy ,
but this movie went a tad overboard in that department.well 
anyway ,
if you love bad movie
and can stand a disgusting `` hero ''
then i am sure
you will like this schlock of a film .
