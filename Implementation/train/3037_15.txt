this movie is one of my very favorites .
it is hard to explain why .
maybe it is the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak ,
but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack .
also 
some of the character have little line or movement or moment
that are amusing in and of themselves .
finally 
the story is one
that always tugs at my heartstring ,
and the last scene is so bittersweet .
all in all 
i love this movie ;
it is perfect for a gooey 
sentimental girl ' night .
