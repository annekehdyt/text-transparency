a dedicated fan to the tlk movie ,
with the first one
being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced ,
along comes this film ...
now i am not arguing with animation ,
voice work 
music ,
but this is no more than a timon/pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere .
although it is not bad ,
it does not add anything .
basically this movie is one big joke ...
and that is about all
that saves it .
make a real tlk3 
disney !
the potential is there.4/10
