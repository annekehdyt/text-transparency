i was not expecting a lot from a film
directed by sidney j. furie and starring dolph lundgren
but i was surely expecting more than a got .
a one-liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie -
did not seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film .
on the other hand 
i would not have bothered to watch this film
if its rating was below 5.0 but hey ,
the movie had a 5.9/10 score ,
which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production.now i
understand
that the 37.5 % of person
who rated this film a 10
( excellent )
was clearly a publicity stunt
because detention is the regular nu image garbage
you have seen before ,
over and over.lundgren does not convince as an ex-military turned a history teacher
assigned to a rough school .
his acting is just plain terrible 
emotionless and contrived .
lundgren 's inability to act becomes more visible in the scene with the juvenile delinquent kid .
either they are great actor or ,
compared to lundgren ,
they seem great actor -
just because they seem natural and believable.detention has some element
that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed-for-weekend high-security high school 
four teen in detention with a war-veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminal
trying to get in - but the story
( something like the breakfast club meets die hard ,
or is it panic room ? )
is full of unbelievable situation 
lot of clich\u00e9s and stereotypical character .
and let 's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor.alex karzis and kata dob\u00f3 play a bonnie and clyde couple in love
and they deliver the most acceptable performance of the movie ,
even if he seems a low-budget version of sam rockwell and she 
a milla jovovich wanna-be .
in a movie
where everything fail ,
their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air
to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero .
