i just finished a marathon of this series ,
and it became agonising to watch as it progressed .
from the fictionalising of the historical element 
to o'herlihy 's awful accent in later episode ,
the show just slumps the further
it goes .
if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww2 fluff ,
then i could recommend season 1 ,
but avoid anything after that ,
it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera ,
with increasingly worse story line and sensibility.the old bandw film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name
attached to it ,
and even that is not what one could hope for .
