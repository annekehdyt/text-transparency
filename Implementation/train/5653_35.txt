do not let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic .
this movie was shot in a lower budget 
probably against the will of ernest marishka ,
so he had to make due.for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany.by a will of the wisp victoria
and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone.they
arrived their too quick .
this probably could not be helped
but the castle they rented ,
for the movie 
was austrian .
when she is told
that she is queen she goes to the royal room
where the member of the court bow to her ,
where are the british citizen out side from the castle cheering for their new queen ?
why isb n't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subject ? low budget !
where the audience back then aware of these imperfection ?
i wonder
how the critic felt ?
durring the inn scene
she meets prince albert
but isb n't excited about it .
durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war song like `` my old kentucky home '' 
and `` old black joe '' .
what ?
civil war song in the 1830 's ?
is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet ?
where is mammy ?
is magna shnieder playing her too ?
is adrian hoven rhett or ashley ?
what was in marishka mind ?
well this add to the camp.it is unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story .
this is the only reason
you should collect it
or see it 03 11 09 correction germany
and england are connected
