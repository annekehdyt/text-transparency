ok 
so 
chuck norris somehow found a way
to get this sequel produced .
i have one question-why ?
who read this script
and said 
`` sound 's great !
original ! ''
this movie is regurgitated crap
that i would not tarnish my toilet bowel with .
of course it is another story ,
following in the tradition of mia 
invasion usa 
walker 
texas ranger 
delta force and so on in which chuck norris 
of course 
is the one man
who can same america from some bad guy .
he does not even need a gun most time .
it is stupid patriotic jargon
that stales the mind .
big surprise
that the only one
who will direct these norris film 's
is chuck 's son eric .
eric norris has primarily worked on all his father 's film and tv show .
does not this strike anyone as a sign
that he has no directing talent ?
afterall 
he is directing the same person as before in the same story
as before ... only difference is the character ' name .
if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa ,
than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined .
hopefully 
this will be the nail in chuck norris 's acting coffin .
