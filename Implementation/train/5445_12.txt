this movie was horrible.they did not develop any of the character at all
and the storyline was played out horribly .
it was a definite sleeper .
you would expect the action scene on a movie like this to be its strong point
but d-war surprise you with even a let down in that department .
also 
the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick .
and i seriously mean that.i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause
it was just that bad ! ! !
please ,
whatever you do person ,
do not waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-war .
