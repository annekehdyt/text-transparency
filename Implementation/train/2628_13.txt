good western filmed in the rocky arizona wild .
lot of tough guy throughout ;
cobern 's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type .
several hole appeared in the picture ,
but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing .
one really dumb scene
show heston emptying .45 case of their powder
and collecting it in a sack for the purpose
of starting a fire .
a. to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule
to carry the ammo .
b. the grass was obviously dry :
why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip ?
