this film has scene
that come back to me at the strangest time
-- that intense scene with mr. muckerji telling mrs melandez
that someone
he spoke with witness the girl
being pushed out the window by a woman
who fits her description --
-is one
that rolls around -- the way
she keeps referring to him by name -- - in a greek accent `` mr muckerji '' --
and then when boyer discovers her having just taken poison
and gives her one last smack up the side of the head before she dies --
- its a delight !
`` fool
-- fool --
all my life '' ... etc etc --
you get the point..i
have to buy this one .
i love dan seymour 's acting
-- he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief
and appeared in casablanca and many great picture .
