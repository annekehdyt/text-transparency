oh dear 
oh dear ... for jm fan 
this was the nail in the coffin
as far as her a-list hollywood career was concerned .
after solid turn in girl can not help it 
wayward bus 
the burglar and rock hunter
it seemed jayne
was well on the way
to becoming one of tinsel town 's hottest star .
however 
an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated mansfield to the sideline 
namely cheap euro loan-out
until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone 's time with the exception of suzy parker
who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material .
many person blame poor jayne and her grating performance for this film 's poor return at the box office
and
while she is a pain in this film ,
she can only do her best with the material .
after all 
cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he ?
after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turn jayne takes 10 step back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing
( simply for the sake of appearing with grant )
to portray this squealing 
idiotic menace .
her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo
and
although she looks good enough
to eat in a boiler suit ,
her every appearance in the film jangles your nerve .
we all know
jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here
she is parading around like a prize pudding .
a real shame.steer clear of this so-called comedy .
it is more depressing than funny .
