this is real character and story driven drama at a level
that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo.i
was impressed right from the start .
do not be put off
if your not a sci fi nut
( like me ... )
this could be happening on earth ,
the fact
that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting .
there are no space ships or laser gun
( none yet anyway )
so far i have seen up to s01 e04 and i am gripped
and wondering what going to happen next
as there are so many possibilities.the cast play there roles with pasion .
eric stoltz is especially strong.this show really stands alone well ,
it does not matter
if you watched bsg or not ,
in fact they are quite different .
i have read some negative review from sci fi geek
who expected less drama and more alien and ray gun etc
but i would say
ignore them.this is a really positive start to a show .
let hope
they do not cann it
after 1 or 2 season like they normally do with good show these day .
