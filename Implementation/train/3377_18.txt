there are two kind of 1950s musical .
first you have the glossy mgm production with big name and great music .
and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast 
less famous music and second rate director .
'the girl can not help it ' belongs to the latter category .
neither tom ewell or edmond o'brien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her ... well ,
never mind .
seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela anderson .
the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can not help suspect
that it is mostly an attempt
to sell record for fat domino 
little richard or other of the 1950s rock act
that appear in the movie .
if that music appeal
to you this
is worth watching .
if not 
do not bother .
