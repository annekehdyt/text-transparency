`` hotel du nord `` is the only carn\u00e9 movie from the 1936-1946 era
which has dialog not written by jacque pr\u00e9vert ,
but by henri jeanson.janson was much more interested in the jouvet/arletty couple than in the pair of lover ,
annabella/aumont.the latter is rather bland ,
and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf 's song `` les amant d'un jour '' ,
except that the chanteuse 's tale is a tragic one.what is fascinating today is this popular little world ,
the canal saint-martin settings.this movie is dear to the french movie buff for another very special reason.the pimp jouvet tells his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e raymonde he wants a change of air
( atmosph\u00e8re )
because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosph\u00e8re 
the whore raymonde
( wonderful arletty )
thinks
it is an insult
and she delivers this line ,
that is 
undeniably 
the most famous of the whole french cin\u00e9ma :
in french : ''
atmosph\u00e8re ? atmosph\u00e8re ? est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosph\u00e8re ? ''
translation attempt : ''
atmosphere ? atmosphere ? have i got an atmosphere face ?
this is our french `` nobody 's perfect '' .
