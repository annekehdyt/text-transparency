it really is that bad of a movie .
my buddy rented it
because he 
well 
is an idiot .
but then again 
i must be an idiot too
because i watched the whole damn thing !
the actor were on par with high school drama geek
who think
that are going place .
the only place they will be going is back to waiting table at luby 's .
all i could think
of while i was watching this `` gem ''
was how it actually got made .
i mean 
some `` screenwriter '' actually thought
that this premise was fresh 
original and lucrative .
then some moron with money believed in the script so much
that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception
that he was going to make a return on it .
actor were cast 
location were scouted ,
make-up artist were hired ,
computer animator fresh out of al collin graphic design school were ought in and this turd started to take form.there obviously were a ton of thing
that i hated about this move
but the one thing
the drove me
the craziest was the overuse of music .
every single minute of this flick was scored .
there was not a single eak in music .
and at time it was mixed higher than the dialogue ,
not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything.after
it was over ,
we decided to watch mystic river .
it was like driving a 1980 vw diesel rabbit
then switching to a bmw 740il .
you could not get two more opposite movie in term of quality .
