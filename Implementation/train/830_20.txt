i first saw this film
when i was flipping through the movie channel on my parent directv .
it was on the sundance channel
and was just starting .
i love music 
especially late 60 and this is what the bjm sounded like
( the dandys are alright ) .
everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music 
to anton and joel 's personality 
to the illicit drug use .
it was funny
because as i was watching the first party scene
when everyone is doing line my parent
walked by
and decided to watch
( the look on their faces were priceless ) .
anyway this is definitely one of my favorite movie
because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre
who is now my favorite band of all time.just watch
it ... seriously
