i bought this dvd
because it has kari in it
and the mpaa rating said ;
`` rated r for strong violence and sexuality 
nudity and language '' .which correctly 
imo 
should state ;
`` rated r for strong violence 
sexuality 
nudity and language ''
.the word `` sexuality '' should come after a `` comma '' 
not an `` and ''
because of the huge difference in meaning it make .
i think
a lot of person
who have watched this movie
will agree with me
that the sexuality and nudity part almost non-existent .
my first impression
when i look at the mpaa rating
was that i will be watching something like `` vivid '' movie .
that is why i felt cheated .
story-wise 
it was so-so 
after-all
who really cares about the story
if the gorgeous kari was in it .
i know
i do not.of course ,
this is only my opinion.joseph
