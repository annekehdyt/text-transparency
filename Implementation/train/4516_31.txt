as many reviewer here have noted ,
the film version differ quite a bit from the stage version of the story .
i have never seen the stage version of the story ,
and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewer .
perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film ,
but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancer
trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas ' show .
the film does right by not selecting any famous actor or performer
to wind up in the final try-out group .
this way our attention is focused on the dancer ' movement and individual story and struggle
as they unfold during a marathon day of try-out .
douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part .
apparently some song were cut out in favor of a new one ,
and the backstage clich\u00e9-ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added .
i have to say
in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film .
the repeated intrusion cassie
made during try-out
appear to mirror the almost desperate plea
one often has to make
when engaging in the artistic profession in the absence of talent and/or luck .
however 
this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past ,
and it is curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again .
the revelation of the dancer themselves began promisingly enough with the `` i can do that '' number ,
but then it plodded a little at various point
while the dancer were telling their story .
frankly 
their story differed little from real life folk
who never get a chance like this .
*** of 4 star .
