what an appalling piece of rubbish ! ! !
who are all these person
who blubber on about how good this is ?
yes 
it is `` arty '' ;
and yes 
it is `` foreign '' 
but ... .
that is not enough .
the plot is boring and disjointed 
like a reality show
but not so slickly made.the person
are intrinsically uninteresting ;
but as character they do not have enough depth
to feel empathy for them .
if they are based on real person
then i feel very ,
very sorry for them.the violence
( and some of it is very violent )
seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous .
it is like the producer has vision
of being quenton tarantino .
not that i think very much of him 
either.and oh yes :
if i had neighbour like these ,
i would move !
