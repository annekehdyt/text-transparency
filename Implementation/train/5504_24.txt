i am sure this was one of those `` woah ! ''
attraction in 1982 when epcot opened ,
but now it is just silly .
the film 's message is clich\u00e9 .
the circle-vision is disorienting .
and that awful song at the end is grating .
and i really wish
they had install seat .
after so much walking ,
all you want to do is sit down for a few minute .
and when you hear
there is a film
to see it sounds pretty glamorous !
you get entertained while sitting down 
right ?
wrong !
you are standing there for 18+ minute leaning against a short little railing .
disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven thing up and replace this dull 
lackluster film .
not fun .
skip it .
in fact 
skip canada altogether unless you are eating there .
move directly to the united kingdom .
