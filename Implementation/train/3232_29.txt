the good thing about this
that is at least fresh :
almost no movie about dance music and the club scene
( if even made )
hit the cinemas .
and it radiates lot of energy too ,
from the music to the portrayal of ibiza.but the main problem is
that it can not decide what it wants to be .
although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap ,
the maker also realized
they would not want to play copycat .
however 
it fails grossly on the joke
because it is not very well written and most character
are underdeveloped .
and it has no arc in its script
and directing to make it to 90 minute ,
so why not edit it down to 75 ?
the production department and cinematography still try to save the day
( e.g .
paul 's home )
.in a strange way
and unexpectedly
so it is all gone
pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous .
especially the scene with beatriz batarda offer some acting power.conclusion :
it is a mess ,
it somewhat entertains at a basic level ,
but you better spend a night in your favorite club .
