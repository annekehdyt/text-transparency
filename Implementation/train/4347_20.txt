i think
that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary thing exist and this film shows no restraint
in trying to exploit that to the fullest .
the presentation is very interesting 
well presented
and the graphic are state of the art ,
but from a scientific point of view it just does not work .
hydrogen filled flying bladder ?
they would need to be the size of a mack truck
to be useful .
and then there is the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion .
i have no problem with fantasy ,
just do not try to pass it off as fact .
some folk will always misunderstand .
all in all the film is entertaining ,
but i constantly found myself saying `` oh other 
what a load of ... . '' .
if you want a fake documentary ,
watch this is spinal tap instead .
or at the very least turn the sound off .
