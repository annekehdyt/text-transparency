i think
micheal ironside acting career must be over ,
if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap .
surely
he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish.this movie
could be far better ,
if it had a good budget ,
but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie .
there is one scene at a outpost ,
which looks like ,
its outside the front of a railway station ,
and i bet
it was.there is one scene
which made give this movie a 3 ,
and it shows the space craft landing
and taking off over a lake ,
surrounded by forest .
this was well done ,
but the rest of the movie 
forget it.there is another scene ,
which looks like a engineering plant ,
which i bet it ,
and does not look like a space outpost
as the character say
it is.this movie is stupid ,
has a serious low budget ,
makes no sense and god help micheal ironside .
