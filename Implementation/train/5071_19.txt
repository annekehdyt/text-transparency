so 
where are the cannibal ?
those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal ' appeal of this film will be let down .
instead 
we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a papua new guinea village full of native ,
one of whom was his lover several decade prior .
the man 
tobias schneebaum is new york jewish
as they come and somehow ,
this is intertwined with the documentary
as he appears in his yamika in several scenes.there are no real cannibal here :
only story relayed by some of the native and by tobias himself .
not all together a bad film .
very interesting and great cinematography .
schneebaum remains highly likable throughout
and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life
that is about as far removed from western civilization
as one can get.it is just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary.4/10 
kid .
