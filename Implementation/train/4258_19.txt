this is arguably john thaw 's finest performance
where he successfully shakes off any trait of his inspector morse character and ings a perfect adaptation of tom from the page of the book to the tv screen .
this is a well made production
which maintains its family viewing vibe
despite some very mature theme like the outeak of the second world war and the physical abuse
suffered by the child.however
it is the relationship between tom and young willie
that is the heart and soul of this story .
it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man
he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection.it is a pity
that this story was not made with a bigger budget with a more established director
as it belongs on the big screen ,
not shown once or twice every ten year on a sunday afternoon .
given the right guidance ,
john thaw would be celeated the world over
and bestowed with many award for his illiant performance in this movie .
a great actor and a great role
that should have been honored more
than it was at the time .
