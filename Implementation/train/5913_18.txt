this movie really has no beginning or end .
and it is really very unbelievable .
mary-k and ashley are supposed to be intern working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company .
but 
for some reason 
they are put up in a 5-star hotel
( conveniently located across the street from the coliseum ) ,
and all of the other intern
they work with
are just as abnormally model-looking
as they are .
one thing
that i found obvious in this movie
is the way
that one of the twin does not end up with the guy .
i guess
they tried to twist their usual plot a bit .
nice try .
