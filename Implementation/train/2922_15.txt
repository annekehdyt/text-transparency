in the standard view 
this is a purely awful movie .
however 
it rate a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale .
i can think of few actual comedy
that make me laugh as hard
as i
did watching this movie .
andy griffith 's ghost
dressed in native american garb dancing
send me into hysteric everytime .
i would not waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it ,
but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning
and it comes on tv ,
check it out .
