`` a classic is something
that everybody wants to have read
but nobody wants to read .
a classic is also something
that everyone praise
but no one has read . ''
-mark twain'classic ' seems to be the word
used to describe `` scarface '' 
brian depalma 's 1983 film about opulence 
self surrender 
greed ,
and danger among florida 's drug ring .
person and critic
( and rapper for that matter )
deem this film 'an epic gangster classic ' or 'eptiome of gangster film . '
when it is anything but .
it is praised for all the wrong reason .
scarface is a terrific film
that deserves praise from all over 
but not all the praise it gets from audience today ,
and therefor the fine point
it so poignantly makes
are missed by the general public.first off ,
the film is about a cuban refugee 
with a past of wanting
to escape communism grasp and find happiness .
simple ?
yes .
but the layer of de palma 's directing genius 
and the great story
written by oliver stone
( yes i know ,
he actually wrote a real good one here )
play into all of it .
the character are all looking for an escape ,
as escape is a natural element
dealt with in the film by all .
each character has something to offer ,
that makes them likable by everyone
who could appreciate this film .
they are entwined in a world of mystique and money ,
but all that has a price ,
as they all learn .
each character thinks
they are getting better chance in life ,
when in true dramatic irony 
they are actually getting worse .
'tragedy ' would be a better word
to describe this movie .
all those
who praise the film for it
is drug usage ,
it is violence ,
it is dialog ,
totally missed the point .
there is nothing really positive about the film besides the character positive expectation of themselves .
and that is why
the film works so well .
the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film ,
not to look cool or attract viewer .
brian de palma does not make movie for cult gangster 
or ainless action fans.next on ,
the film is an adult drama .
it is not a 'gangster film ' .
it has it is share of action ,
but the action is plotted very carefully ,
so it has a point .
it is not like `` alien '' - an example of a big dumb action film ,
and most audience perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film
about doing drug and shooting person .
ridiculous .
hogwash .
if this film is about that ,
then it is about how bad it is .
not a promotion of it .
this being said ,
the film is indeed a great film .
it has great cinematography
that pulls you into the story .
it has a very dramatic score
( in true giorgio moroder style ) ,
which simply could give you chill ,
or ing you to tear .
the film is rather lengthy ,
but it is a story ,
and each moment counts .
the acting is terrific .
al pacino - enough said .
he can do any role
that he puts his mind to ,
and this was no exception .
pretty boy steven bauer 
as manny .
i did not think much of him in other film
he did ,
but he actually makes you like him
when he goes under maestro de palma 's direction .
michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira .
popping ' fresh off the heel of a sort of embarrassment in `` grease 2 ''
she got her ticket
to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty
that is more than meets the eye .
but the three true diamond in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony 's sister gina ,
who
when she smiles 
or cry ,
we see her soul and her fresh way of living ,
and watch it deteriorate ;
paul shenar as alejandro sosa 
a drug lord ,
who runs deeper than a river ,
and shenar portray him as so ;
and miriam colom as tony and gina 's torn mother .
these three dig the film as deep
as it can go .
this reviewer learned one main thing
when watching `` scarface '' for the first time .
always go into a film unsuspecting .
all the hype and talk of this film can not possibly prepare you for what you really see .
only knowing de palma
( like i do )
can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds .
so ignore the rap crap ,
ignore the mindless violence supporter ,
and fix yourself a glass of bailey 's on the rock ,
and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film 
the real `` scarface . ''
