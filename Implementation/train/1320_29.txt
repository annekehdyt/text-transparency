i own this movie .
i bought it for $ 3.99 at a fairly major video retailer
in order to do some `` indie '' '' type movie research since i had just finished my own feature
and was editing it .
now
when i feel down about my skill
as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookie and severed .
within minute i feel great ! !
! i hate to down talk another filmmaker
so i will just use constructive criticism .
1. find good actor .
take the time .
it really helps .
2.
when shooting video ,
over light your scene and darken in the computer later on in post .
3. closeup are better for video .
4.
when an actor enters a scene 
wait a bit beforehaving them speak so
that we know
what is going on and who 's talking .
5. never show the back of a door
while we wait for someone to come open it .
damn well worth the $ 3.99the true horror
would be getting
the reviews severed has here on imdb .
and you have to give these guy credit ...
they did get distributed .
