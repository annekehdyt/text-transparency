yeah 
i remember this one !
many year since i actually watched it .
the story was entirely surreal 
but nonetheless great !
what anyone
who rate and reviews movie ought to bear in mind
is what the respective movie aim at .
it is the same with `` first kid '' ,
which follows a similar pattern .
certain movie - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense .
such movie can not be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer .
of course these movie lack quality 
lack a sophisticated storyline 
very often lack first-class acting ,
but if they do fulfil their primary premise -
that is okay .
i do not have this movie here on my list of all-time favorite ,
but i still thought
it was funny ,
had some very enjoyable sequence
and made a good story .
brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway .
