first let me preface this post
by saying
that i am a fan of the original star war movie ... i do not read the book 
play the game 
wear the underwear or eat the cereal
( if there is one ) .
i am simply a fan of the films.with
that being said ,
i struggle to see how person are giving this movie such high praise .
taking this movie by itself ,
and not comparing it to it is terrible predecessor
( ep 1 
2 ) ,
i do not understand
how you can say
this is an amazing movie .
for all of the terrible shortcoming in the script - cheesy dialogue 
contrived scene
( ie r2
suddenly being a badass ,
and long cgi intense chase scene
that have little human touch ) ,
horrible acting ,
and noted plot hole ...
how is this good ?
there was no real internal dilemma within anakin ;
it just seemed like a switch was flipped
and he was evil all of a sudden .
i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minute or so
( which by the way was ruined by the `` noooooo ! ''
frankenstein scene ) .
when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effect and fill in the gap with absolutely atrocious one-liner
when more could have
and should have been said ,
this is not a great movie .
for a film with such a `` dark '' tone 
there was too much levity in the speech of all characters.i close with a question :
from the beginning to the end of the film 
was there really a sense of urgency
and importance for what was actually about to take place ?
