road to perdition 
a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mende
( and in my opinion his best work ) ,
a director
who three year
before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty .
this is a terrific movie ,
and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.it is a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult time of depression when the 
michael sullivan 
a father of two child ,
played by great tom hank
( i am not his admirer but ought to say that )
is a hit-man for local mafia boss ,
played by paul newman .
his eldest son 
a thirteen year boy michael sullivan jr. 
perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin ,
after year of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job
and on what money their family live .
prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth
he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder ,
committed by john rooney 
son of his father boss .
such discovery strike an innocent soul
and it caused numerous event
that changed his life forever .
the atmosphere of the period 
all the background and decoration are perfectly created 
editing and cinematography are almost flawless
while the story is well written .
but the main line of the movie 
the most important moment and point of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relation in bad time .
they are shown so deeply 
strong and believable .
tom hank does excellent
and has one of the best performance of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across
the board is superb .
finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result
we get an outstanding work of all person
involved in making this beautiful
( but one more time sad ) masterpiece .
i believe road to perdition belong to greatest achievement of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best film of the year.my grade 10/10
