oh 
cgi .
a blessing
when used properly .
a sin with it is used by person
who have no idea what their doing .
sadly 
that is not the only thing
that is used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip-off.ok ,
anybody
who has read any number of my posted reviews
has probably noticed 2 thing .
1 :
i like low-budget horror movie .
and 2 :
if there is a cute guy
in said low-budget movie ,
i will usually point them out .
so 
let 's just get this out of the way right now .
this is one low-budget horror movie i did not like .
the acting 
for the most part 
is horrible 
effect laughable ,
and the script rival battlefield earth
as the worst i have witnessed this year .
as far as the resident cute boy ... dax miller
( bog )
wins
that prize hand down .
this boy is hot !
and surprisingly 
he is not just a toned body with nice eye and a cute butt ...
he can actually act
( well ,
as much as he can in this odious film ) .
now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way ,
let 's get on with it.in cliff note version ,
here is the story
( do not worry ,
i will try not to give anything away ) ...
a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfer
( established cute boy and his buddy )
who surf with shark .
unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island .
croc shows up 
mayhem ensue ,
and person are eaten .
roll end credits.as i
said earlier 
this film pretty much blow .
it started pretty well ,
but soon devolved into being silly and stupid .
a main character becomes lunch
( in a rather humorous way ) ,
and our remaining heros utter one-liner at the victim expense .
also ,
if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water ,
what is with all the shark around ?
if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat ,
i do not think
a few skimpy shark would stick around .
the fx is some of the worst i
have ever had the displeasure to see .
the cgi is horrendous ,
and they have even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs .
attention 
filmmaker .
national geographic .
discovery store .
the croc hunter .
they know what crocodiles look like .
you obviously did not reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film .
and what is with the pirate/drug pusher gang ?
did you just need another reason to rip off a woman 's top ?
it is funny how we get little sub-genre in the movie world .
with alligator and it is sequel 
lake placid 
crocodile ,
and now blood surf 
it now looks like `` over-sized crocodile/alligator '' movie should now get their own category at blockbuster .
alligator was good .
lake placid was good .
i even thought
tobe hooper 's crocodile was good .
blood surf 
sucked.my grade :
d-
