one of the greatest western of all time !
but this one 
unlike many other 
does not deal with the nature 
horse 
shootout 
etc. ,
but instead deal with one rifle 
the winchester '73 ,
and how this one rifle effect other
and how they effect it .
a rifle is not a living 
eathing 
human being 
right ?
you may be inclined to believe
that it is not .
but it seems to have a mind of its own 
for two very similar reason :
it gets back to its rightful owner in the end ,
even though that throughout the rest of the picture 
its unthoughtful `` owner '' do their best to make sure
it does not ,
and it never seems to be content
until it gets back to its original owner 
so 
coincidentally 
the unthoughtful `` owner '' always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect
and keep it ,
until it gets back to jame stewart ,
then it is `` content '' .
but 
not every one of the owner deserve to have it .
stewart does 
of course ,
since he won it .
mcnally does not ,
since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it .
drake definitely does not ,
because he would probably lose it in some poker game ,
and beside 
drake is too cowardly to fight ,
so why should he have a one-of-a-kind rifle
if he will not even use it ?
duryea does not ,
because he is just a chuckling maniac ,
and we all know
that chuckling maniac do not deserve gun .
this film has a sort of noir edge
that only western can have 
such as the ox-bow incident .
western have their own type of noir 
much different than the 30 's and 40 's bogart film .
it is 
hands-down 
the best one out of all five stewart-mann western ,
even though my personal favorite is `` bend of the river '' .
the other four became much different than this one .
i do not think it a coincidence
to see
that the other four were color ,
and this is black and white .
this is because of the noir edge .
all five film had the revenge and the dark past on stewart 's part play into the film 
to the point where this is not just stewart 's dark side ,
but also actually a sort of character 
not one to be listed in the credit ,
but one
that you can only recognize
and know
that it is there ,
always present .
however 
this one 
not just on revenge and the dark past ,
but also in term of supreme danger ,
and character
that were very different than stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspect .
but stewart never crosses the line .
he does 
however 
walk the line between light and dark .
this is why black and white played such an integral part in the film .
they could have all been black and white ,
or they could have all been color .
but this one is in black and white ,
and the other four are in color ,
and there is a very good reason for that .
