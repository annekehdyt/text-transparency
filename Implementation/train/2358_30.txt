i found 'still crazy '
to be marvelously entertaining ,
and not only to those of us
who lived through that raucous era of late '60 
early '70s rock .
my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd
( do not worry ,
it is only been three time )
and she loves
it too.it is a truly loving 
poignant and hilarious nod to the era 
and every actor hits his/her note with perfection .
it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i
am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'love actually ' ought him more attention .
bruce robinson was incredible as brian 
inging real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype .
it was interesting to see
that robinson has made quite a name
for himself as a writer.i live in sherman oak 
california ,
and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall
( he lived here at the time )
and told him
it was one of my five favorite film of all time .
he invited me to sit down at the food court with him
and we discussed the movie for some time .
we even talked of the idea of an american-oriented remake
before wisely dismissing that .
why mess with the original ? my only problem with 'still crazy ' is that it was not hugely popular in theater
and too many person have missed out on a wonderful experience .
