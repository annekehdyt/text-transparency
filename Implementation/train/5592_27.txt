now 
i will not deny
that
when i purchased this off ebay ,
i had high expectation .
this was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy
that i so enjoy .
however 
i was soon to be disappointed .
apology to those
who enjoyed it ,
but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch .
i got a few smile 
sure ,
but the majority of the funny came from the music videos
( which i have got on dvd )
and the rest was basically filler .
you could tell
that this was not al 's greatest video achievement
( that honor goes to uhf ) .
honestly 
i doubt
if this will ever make the jump to dvd ,
so if you are an ultra-hardcore al fan
and just have to own everything ,
buy the tape off ebay .
just do not pay too much for it .
