two kind of movie
we like are
( 1 )
western ,
and ( 2 )
movie from 30 or 40 year ago .
we ought to have liked a man
called sledge ;
but ... ..but ... this picture is disagreeable 
annoying and stupid from start to finish .
since there is nobody in the story
( good or bad )
to warm up to ,
there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense
to keep the viewer interested .
no camaraderie among the guy
trying to steal the gold ,
and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it .
sledge has a pretty girl friend ,
but there is no reason
why she slobbers all over the guy
or why
she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.the film
also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score 
and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow.of the last 30 older movie
rented from netflix or video vault ,
this was the rock bottom 
the only true dud in the bunch .
