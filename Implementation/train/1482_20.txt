yes 
this movie make me feel real horror ,
when i realized
that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life
trying to watch it .
the bald guy just give me the impression
of being a psycho - junkie actor
and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen .
believe me
if you appreciate your time avoid this movie ,
i understand
a movie requires money
to be created
and some movie do not have that money
but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting .
i am always supporting independent movie ,
when it deserves the support ,
but movie like this makes a bad name for this kind of movie .
i am still traumatized .
i will not trust in any nice cover anymore .
