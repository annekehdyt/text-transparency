well since seeing part 's 1 through 3 i can honestly say
that they should have never made part 4. everything from the tacky ,
and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting 
i dare anyone to watch this
and not be bored out of their minds.i mean part 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion ,
but without him around in this one
it is just not the same .
sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line 's ,
but it was a good closure at the end of the third one .
again there was no reason for a part 4.
even if there was they could have done a much better job
than this sh*t i had to sit through 
lol .
there goes an hour
and a half of my life i will never see again .
