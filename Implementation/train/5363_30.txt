after viewing `` whipped '' at a distributor 's screening at the afm the other night ,
i have to say
that i was thoroughly impressed .
the audience was laughing all the way through .
unfortunately 
every territory was already sold ,
so i did not have the opportunity
to purchase the film ,
but i truly believe
that it will be a big hit both domestically and over sea .
i agree with the comment
that `` whipped '' should not be pitched as a male `` sex and the city 
''
mainly because unlike `` sex and the city 
''
`` whipped '' is a satire about dating
that never takes itself too seriously .
`` whipped '' poke fun at relationship in a way
that most sex comedy would not dare .
also 
the film
that i screened at the afm
had more of a plot and story than `` swinger 
'' `` clerk 
'' and `` sex and the city '' combined .
`` whipped '' never slowed down for a beat
and provided the audience with non-stop comedy .
the performance of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid ,
which only made the film more impressive
considering the budget .
