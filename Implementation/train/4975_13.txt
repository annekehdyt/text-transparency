this had a good story ...
it had a nice pace
and all character are developed cool.i have watched a whole bunch of movie in the last two week
and this had to be the best one i have seen in the two week.jason bigg 's character was the best though.even
though it was small ,
it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning.this may be a romantic comedy
and i do not like most ,
but the writing 
direction ,
performing 
sound 
design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool.this film scored pretty high out of all the movie 's i have seen lately -
and the rest were big budget or better publicized.good job in writing .
