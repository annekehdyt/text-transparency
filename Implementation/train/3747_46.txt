now please do not start calling me name like 
`` unpatriotic '' 
`` weirdo '' and more .the very length of this movie
( 4 hour ..
! ! ! )
is its biggest mistake .
no editing at all - seems like j.p. dutta fell in love with his project too much .
even lagaan was 4 hour long -
but it was entertaining
and gave a message
as well .it is based on true incident and real person .
kudos to it ,
but were the repetitive war scene really needed ?
on top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another
and it was impossible to keep a track of them all .between the skirmish ,
there were song about loneliness 
lovesickness and related stuff .
there were chummy conversation .
in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence
but became so monotonous later
that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk .why were the soldier walking around
as if they were lion in jungle 
fully unaware
that enemy was lurking somewhere near ?
and when they were shot ,
it elicited sympathy
but it seemed unmindful of them
to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place .music
was melodious
and the lyric were soulful but did not fit with the movie .
better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie .acting was the saving grace :
from seasoned veteran like sanjay dutt and ajay devgan 
to relative newby like abhishek bachchan and akshaye khanna ,
everyone acted like a pro .
manoj bajpai and ashutosh rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood
whenever necessary .dialogue ranged from illiant
( `` from madhuri .. with love ! ! '' )
to illogical / monotonous
( `` pakistan se zyada musalman hindusthan mein hain '' ) .
and the expletive spree
consisting of all the mcs 
bcs 
cs and f-word was not really required .
loc kargil attempt to provide a fitting tribute to the ave indian soldier ,
but try too hard and ultimately fail .
indian soldier surely deserve a better tribute .
