that is the question you have to ask yourself
when you watch this movie `` what was the point ? ''
this movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable person
( not going to use the word actor )
and a script
that you could tell
did not exist.one of the thing
that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said
`` victorian story written by ''
which means
that there was actually a script to that part of the story .
the entire victorian section had no dialogue ,
and was just comprised of shot of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa .
making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.ok 
time for the story .
it starts out with a guy
sitting in a chair
never once getting out of it .
oh blocking ,
who needs you ?
these newsperson come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girl .
so he starts off the story in victorian time .
and here is how the scene goes
( guy and girl are in a field .
pretty music starts to play )
( guy stare at girl )
( girl stare at guy )
( guy stare at girl )
cut back to movie .
that is pretty much all
that happens for about half the movie.the rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of model wanting
to buy an apartment .
so this real estate agent shows them one
and when i say
the dialogue is awkward i mean ,
if it were a dancer
it would trip during the macarena .
none of the character in this movie are likable .
the model are incredibly irritating ,
the victorian person do not talk ,
and the guy telling
the story has the personality of a sack of onion .
so eventually all the girl get killed off .
and by killed off 
i mean drug offscreen .
ooh .
you showed one death ?
and by death i mean holding her face
till they put the blood makeup on ?
awesome.how this guy even knows this story baffles me .
he says
it is because he saw it .
but how ?
there was no guy in that apartment !
the door was locked shut with no way out ,
the window were attached to a fire escape
that was too rotten to work ,
how the hell did he see all that ?
oh plot hole .
we do love you .
so the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying
`` i think
you made it up .
you are wasting our time ''
despite the fact
that she begged him for the interview in the first place .
whatever .
this movie was stupid 
pointless ,
and made no sense with a lot of plot hole .
i could go on and on about this movie ,
but i do not see the need .
i would much rather spend my time doing something uselful .
like widdle something .
`` hell 's threshold '' more belong in purgatory with 2 dumb model .
out of 10 .
