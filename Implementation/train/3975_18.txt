i think
that this film adds to diversity
and is very accurate in term of historic reconstruction .
the way
it shows the various community
leaving together in thailand
is very interesting ... the portuguese 
the japanese 
and the various community being managed by the king .
the plot around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason .
the wardrobe is fine .
the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production .
the scene with the elefant as executor is very interesting .
it is fun
and i think
that is also usable in school for its historic accuracy
because it shows
that the european in asia were subject of the local king in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective .
