back in 1994 
i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july -
something like 17 day off in a row what with two week paid vacation 
weekend and the holiday itself .
i stayed in town during that time ,
hanging out at my parent ' house a lot.i did not have a tv in my apartment
so i used
to watch my parent ' tube .
i had just finished watching a segment of the x file
when a program came on called personal fx .
i was hooked instantly .
i had always been fascinated with item in our home
that had come from my parent ' family home and through inheritance from relative ' estate ,
and often wondered about their history 
value 
etc.after my long vacation 
i used to go to my folk ' house on my lunch-hours
just to catch personal fx.i can remember one episode during which co-host claire carter announced
that the new york apartment
in which the series was filmed
was being renovated and that
once said
renovation were complete
that personl fx would return to the air.it
never did !
personal fx was the first -and best - of the collectible show .
and it vanished from the air !
almost fifteen year later 
i am still sore.way to go 
fx .
