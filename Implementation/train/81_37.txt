when the chamberlain family is camping near ayer rock 
australia 
lindy chamberlain
( meryl streep )
sees her baby
being dragged out of their tent by a dingo
and then begins an ordeal
that no one should have to experience .
for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press ,
and the whole thing turns into a circus .
lindy does not help matter
either because she will not play to the jury or courtroom ,
she is only herself ,
and she is a tough nut to crack ,
so of course everyone thinks
she is guilty
because there is a piece of evidence
that has not come to light .
sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain 
a seventh-day adventist pastor ,
who has doubt about his faith and perhaps about his wife .
it is good
( or bad )
to see
that person are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere
as they are in the state too ,
because the australian public does not believe the story and the medium only fans the flame .
eventually 
lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor 
but year later 
a missing piece of evidence show up
and she is freed ,
but not until after the family 's life is basically ruined .
a heart-eaking story 
very well done 
a bit long but well worth seeing .
8/10 .
