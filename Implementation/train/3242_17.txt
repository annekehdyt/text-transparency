this show is one of the worst show of all time !
absolutely no original joke
and they are always a year late .
like in 2009 they will finally say something about michael vick 's dogfight .
all of the cast member are person
who wanted to be on s.n.l
but had to go to the lowest of the low ,
mad tv.it an hour of mad magazine joke witch are not funny to begin with ,
told by terrible john stewart wan na bee .
so if you have any problem
tell me id love to hear the opinion of the 3 person
who watch this show .
family guy put
it well `` osama bin ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look 
the cast of mad tv .
there is a reason
why no one watches the show .
