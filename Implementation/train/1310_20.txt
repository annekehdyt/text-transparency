i was a little skepticle
if i should watch this
when it was first shown on cbs .
i was one of the many person
who were in nyc on that day ,
i was going to school at hunter college .
i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again ,
but like many i was curious to see what this was all about .
tear came to my eye watching this documentary .
all my memory returned
and just the intense image were unbelievable .
i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary
and watched it a few time .
how these guy were able to capture this footage
was incredible .
if you have not seen this documentary ,
do yourself a favor and check it out .
it is obviously depressing
and will ing tear to eye ,
but it is an incredible document of this country darkest hour .
