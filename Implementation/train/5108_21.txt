... but it will make you wonder
if we had any in the first place !
this movie is just as bad as any of today 's horrible horror .
a man goes around ogling semi-clad lady ,
trying to decide
which one to kill so
he can give his girlfriend a new body .
one scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minute ,
coating everything what what must be well over ten gallon of `` blood . ''
the movie also attempts to create a sense
that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature ,
but the movie is so badly done
it is impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage .
aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister 
this movie can not even get its own title straight
-- the beginning credit say
`` the brain
that would not die 
''
but the end credit list it as `` the head
that would not die . ''
