the story concerns a genealogy researcher
( mel harris )
who is hired by her estee lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt .
her aunt
( by marriage we are left to presume )
is trying to track down her long lost family in europe .
all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl
standing by an ornate music box .
the researcher head to europe and conducts her search in place like milan 
budapest 
and vienna .
the scenery is the real thing
and is actually shot on location
( unlike a murder ,
she wrote
where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and lansbury never left burbank ) .
anyway 
she meets a young man
who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own
and they team up
to track down clue and menace bad guy .
the dialogue 
particularly the romantic dialogue 
is terrible .
i watched this
because of the scenery
but the script was so bad
that i stayed on just to see
if it would get worse .
it did .
acting was also off .
i can see
why mel harris 's career never really took off after thirtysomething ,
but she is adequate
( seems too old for her co-star though ) .
but 
the supporting player are straight out of the community playhouse .
i also lost count of how many time they say
`` budapest '' to each other .
yes 
it is pronounced bood-a-phesht .
we know 
okay ?
i realized halfway into the film
that this had to be one of those harlequin movie
and sure enough it is .
guess that says it all .
