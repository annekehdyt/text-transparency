cute and playful 
but lame and cheap .
'munchy ' is another gremlin clone
to come out from the 80s .
i am not much of a fan of the imitations.first
it was the excellent 'gremlin'.then came the very average 'critter'.let
not forget the lousy 'ghouly'.but the complete pit would have to go to 'hobgoblin'.is there more ? ?
now 'munchy ' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'ghouly ' and 'hobgoblin ' .
actually i probably found it more entertaining than 'ghouly ' ,
but i preferred thst one 's darker tone .
from the get-go it plays up its goofy nature
( which it is better for it ) ,
but due to that nature the hammy acting
( alix elias and charlie phillip ) ,
can get rather overbearing
that you rather just see the munchy running amok .
that is where the fun occurs .
mostly light-hearted fluff though ,
as the story mainly centres on the munchy
( who are either hungry 
horny and destructive )
in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounter
( some moment do work )
in the small desert town as a couple of person are on the chase .
it is silly ,
but strangely engaging thank to the zippy pacing .
the creature themselves look rather bland
and poorly detailed ,
as they are basic doll being chucked about .
where their personality arrived from is that they can actually speak ... and with attitude.charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde
( who was in 'critter ' )
were fair lead .
harvey korman was acceptable in two role .
robert picardo also pops up.amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding .
