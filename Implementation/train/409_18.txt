when i saw this movie a few day ago ,
my eye were completely fixed to the screen .
its greatness held my attention to such an extent
that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration .
i would recommend seeing
it not just to fan of anime ,
but to anyone who likes great movie period
( or who likes really weird stuff ) .
the style of art is beautiful ,
the sound is perfect ,
and the symbolism within it is eathtaking .
i have heard complaint about the weird insertion of english text in the movie ,
but i think
the way
its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie .
the self-attributed description of `` hello kitty on acid '' does not do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportion .
i would like to find more work by whoever made this ,
and see them .
