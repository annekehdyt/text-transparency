`` rival reporter pat morgan
( ginger roger )
and ted rand
( lyle talbot )
are always trying to out-scoop each other on story .
the latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist
who fell to his death
after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment .
the two reporter start out as rival but combine effort
to solve the crime
and write the story
when more resident of the apartment building turn up dead 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.this said-to-be follow-up to `` the thirteenth guest ''
has little to do with the earlier movie ;
it is not a sequel ,
as has been inferred .
ms. roger continues to develop her skill .
mr. talbot adds a little humor to his characterization .
they are a pleasant team ,
the plot is interesting and mysterious ;
but 
the resulting film is very dull .
the opening and closing are startling .
a long-winded wrap-up of plot development point follows the climax .
*** a shriek in the night
( 1933 )
