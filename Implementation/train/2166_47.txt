on the night of his bachelor party 
paul coleman
( jason lee )
meets the gorgeous dancer becky
( julia stile )
in the bar ,
they drink a lot together and in the next morning ,
he wakes up with her on the bed .
his future mother-in-law calls him and inform
that his fianc\u00e9e karen
( selma blair )
might be arriving in his apartment ,
and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry .
sooner 
he finds
that her has crabs ,
and later 
in the preparation of his wedding dinner party 
he realizes
that becky is the cousin of karen .
this is the beginning of a very funny comedy 
with hilarious situation .
the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actress and actor .
julia stile and selma blair ,
who are excellent actress and extremely gorgeous ,
and jason lee ,
who is amazingly funny ,
have good performance .
i laughed a lot along the story ,
but there are some scene
that are really hilarious .
for example 
when paul finds becky in his bed ;
when he finds her paint ;
his imagination in many situation ;
in the drugstore 
trying to buy and get explanation about the crab medicine ; most of the scene of his neighbor 
the minister ;
when karen calls the department store ;
or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul .
i could number many other scene ,
but better off the reader rent or buy this movie
and have lot of fun .
my vote is seven.title
( brazil ) : ''
louco por ela ''
