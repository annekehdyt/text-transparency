ho-hum .
an inventor 's
( horst buchholz )
deadly biological weapon is in danger
of falling into the wrong hand .
unknowingly his son
( luke perry )
has been working on the antedote all along .
enter cia agent olivia d'abo and the cat-and-mouse car chase and gunfire begin .
also in the cast are :
tom conti 
hendrick haese and an aging roger moore .
moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better effort .
perry fan will be accepting .
d'abo is wrong for the role ,
but nice to look at .
