i just rented
and watched this movie just to see what is all the fuss about .
so here is what my reaction to it are .
it is easily seen
that this is a low budget film with poor actor .
the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapist .
this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film .
however 
the movie does not shock or disturb me at all .
it just bored me .
this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minute .
all lot of scene are mainly there to fill in time ,
like those scenery scene and some scene i described below .
************contain spoiler************ i find the rape scene quite tame .
i do not know
if i have watched the cut or uncut version ,
if there is actually such a version .
i also found many plot hole within the already badly written plot .
here is a list on top of my mind.why do not the rapist rape jennifer during the night
when she walked out her house
to find out
what those noise are .
that would be an excellent time.why do
not they just gang rape her ,
instead of delaying some of the rapist the pleasure and lengthening jennifer 's ordeal by such a long time .
it would probably be more shocking and disturbing
that way.i found it really stupid
that the rapist left her in the forest and head back to her house .
maybe to show
that these rapist are really imbeciles.these rapist
should at least know
that
if you want to do a dirty job right ,
they should not send a coward imbecile
to do the job.why
did not jennifer call the police
when the rapist finally left ?
which should be the first thing
that pops up in most person 's mind 
especially for someone
who is a writer .
why did not these rapist smell danger mile away
when they saw jennifer is alive ?
i find it really amazing
that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree
and hang him .
************************end spoiler************but hey 
this movie is not without its merit 
camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i
have recently heard
when matthew protest of going back into the house and kill jennifer 
`why me ?
why me 
i did not even c^m ! ! ! '
