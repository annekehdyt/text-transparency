i can not believe
that so much talent can be wasted in one movie !
the gingeread man starts of on the right foot ,
and manages to build up some great expectation for the ending .
but at some point
the movie turns into one of the worst story i
have ever wasted my time on .
it is just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh 's character around by his nose .
the movie climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer ,
which has been left out in the sun too long .
the gingeread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever
and this is not changed by the fact
that talented star crowd the movie .
do not waste your time here !
