this film concern purportedly non-establishment type
( aesthetically and sexually )
who apparently can not resist basic romantic need .
although some excellent player take part ,
including jon tenney 
timothy olyphant 
and cynthia nixon ,
they are grounded by a puerile script
which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue ;
which is not .
nixon 's role possesses the best line ,
but she often home in on them too quickly ,
a timing flaw
which must be saddled upon the director .
the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche ,
spent or not ,
and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy .
