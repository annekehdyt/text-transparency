last night i finished re-watching `` jane eyre ''
( 1983 ) ,
the bbc mini-series adapted from charlotte bronte 's gothic romance novel
which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton
( my favorite jame bond )
as mr. edward rochester and zelah clarke ,
as jane eyre 
a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl 
a governess at mr. rochester 's estate 
thornfield .
`` jane eyre '' has been one of my most beloved book
since i was an 11-year-old girl
and the friend of mine gave it to me with the word ,
`` this book is amazing ''
and so it was
and i have read
it dozens of time and i am still not tired of it .
its beautiful language 
refined 
fragrant 
and surprisingly fresh 
the dialog 
and above all 
two main character 
and the story of their impossible
love have attracted many filmmaker .
`` jane eyre '' has been adapted to tv and big screen many time 
18
according to imdb .
the actor as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welle 
william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg 
george c. scott and susannah york 
ciar\u00e1n hind and samantha morton have played the couple
that had overcome hundred of obstacle
made by society 
law 
religion ,
by the difference in age 
background 
experience 
and by the fateful mistake
that would hunt one for many year .
of all these film i have only seen one 
300 minute long bbc version from 1983
that follows the novel closely
and where timothy dalton
who frequently plays dark ,
ooding character did not just play edward rochester illiantly and with class ,
he was mr. rochester - sardonic 
viant 
the force of nature 
powerful 
passionate 
sexy 
and tormented master of thornfield .
zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet 
gentle 
intelligent and strong jane
who feels deeply
and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning 
and quiet but firm willpower.added on september 17 
2007 :
during the last two week 
i have seen five `` jane eyre '' movie
and it was a wonderful experience .
there is something to admire in every adaptation of `` jane eyre ''
even if not all of them are completely successful .
this version is still my favorite `` jane eyre '' film .
