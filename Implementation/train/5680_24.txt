generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending ;
the acting was spectacular
and the character did not stray from their person .
i especially liked the plot ,
although you knew
what was going to happen
it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie .
however 
i find that coming on to the ending
it could have been a little longer
( extended maybe )
- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit ;
as if the writer was trying to take linen off the line
before the rain fell .
for instance- what happened to tristan 's other 
hayden ?
for all we know
he died in the hospital .
maybe he was the one
that setup the entire thing ? !
who knows !
maybe there will be a sequel ?
maybe ?
if there is.. i can not wait to see it .
