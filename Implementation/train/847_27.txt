meryl streep is such a genius .
well 
at least as an actress .
i know
she is been made fun of for doing a lot of role with accent ,
but she nails the accent every time .
her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring .
mrs. chamberlain 
as portrayed here 
was not particularly likable 
nor all that smart .
but that just makes streep 's work all the more remarkable .
i think
she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nomination .
about the film 
well 
there were a couple of interesting thing .
i do not know much about australia ,
but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story .
i had largely missed this
when i first saw the film some year ago ,
but it came through loud and clear yesterday .
and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleague .
a pretty good film .
a bit different .
grade :
b
