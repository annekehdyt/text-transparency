yeah 
it is low budget .
yeah 
it is one of candy 's earliest film ,
but it is maybe his funniest !
john candy was not so far removed from his sctv day in `` going berserk ''
and it shows .
if you do not crack up
when candy try to help a guy with his grocery
while being hand-cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process
of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them
( huh ? 
see the movie !
) 
or the way euguene levy
( the creator of kong fu yu )
is talking to his mom on the phone 
or just the countless number of facial expression
that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse !
if you like the john candy of `` only the lonely '' this is may not be a movie i
would advise you to see ,
but
if you enjoy the sctv day of john candy ,
this movie is a must see !
