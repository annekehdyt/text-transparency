for such a great classic tale 
the setting
( location ) ,
grendel was disappointing .
as a writer 
i blame the script
which completely lacked dramatic tension .
the ruic of the club story is useful
and would have provided a new take on the literary classic .
for some weird reason
that ruic was dropped early on .
to know this was shot in 21 day says to me 
`` rushed ''
and it unfortunately shows .
now we will have to wait for the hollywood version on the big screen .
i word on fx 
i can tolerate really crappy cgi
but the script has to rock
and this one was just too slow 
spartan and lacking in drama .
i would blame it on the actor but ...
since i know writing more than acting ,
i will pick on my colleague .
