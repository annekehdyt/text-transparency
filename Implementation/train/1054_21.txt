from the what was she thinking ?
file :
whoopi goldberg plays a cop in the future
who is teamed with a talking dinosaur
( ! )
for a crime case
involving a madman
who wants to start another ice-age .
straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous 
a high-concept in search of itself .
apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director 
jonathan betuel
( who also served as one of the producer ) ;
sadly 
the end result are anemic ,
to be charitable .
goldberg 's mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter
how poor the script ,
but here she is drowning
and you can see the unfunny result .
no star from ****
