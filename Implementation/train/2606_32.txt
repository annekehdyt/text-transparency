this is 
in my opinion 
a very good film 
especially for michael jackson lover .
it contains a message on drug 
stunning special effect ,
and an awesome music video.the main film is centered around the song and music video 'smooth criminal . '
unlike the four-minute music video ,
it is normal speed
and 
in my opinion 
much easier to watch.the plot is rather weird 
however .
michael jackson plays a magical 'gangster '
that ,
when he sees a shooting star ,
he transforms into a piece of machinery .
throughout the film ,
he transforms into a race car 
a giant robot ,
and a space ship.the robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange .
i found it a little out-of-whack
compared to the rest of the film.a child
is kidnapped ,
michael try to save her ,
is tortured and beaten ,
and suddenly turns into a giant robot
that blows up all the bad guy .
a little weird ?
yeah.but besides the bizarre robot scene ,
it is a very good movie ,
and any michael jackson fan will enjoy both the smooth criminal music video and the movie .
