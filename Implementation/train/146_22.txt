great movie
when i saw it .
have to say one of my favorite movie of all time .
i saw it like 8 time in the theater
and got the dvd .
as i got older
and saw it again i realized
that the movie is average .
compared to movie
that are known ad good comedys ,
this is nothing .
i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff eaks a little barrier
which is great .
also the thought
of how the movie goes is a nice way
of thinking .
it is like most thought of a movie
but also a little twist
which is a very nice touch .
i like the movie overall
so i give it a ...
still a good 7/10 for me .
