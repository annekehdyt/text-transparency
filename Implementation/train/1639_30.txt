though i never like to be the sort of person
who negates another 's personal taste ;
if you like something ,
that is fine .
but 
this movie was horrible
and there is no way around it .
i do not like ani difranco too much ,
but she is a great guitarist and songwriter ,
that i can admit .
but i can not admit to there being any redeeming quality to this film .
many person way
that it is an accurate portrayal of issue
that high school student face .
maybe ,
but everything is portrayed too far-fetched .
there seems to be an attempt at a `` naked gun '' - esque kind of comedy ,
but the timing is off ;
there is too much space between each actor line ,
as if they are holding for laughter
( there was not any ) .
whoever wrote
the script was all over the place .
they tried to cram as many controversial issue together in one film ,
almost never fully developing any of them
( especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher ) .
i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie .
i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire
to do anything
but roll my eye at the screen .
