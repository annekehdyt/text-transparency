i can not accept the negative comment of other reviewer .
they are too critical ,
perhaps
because they are stuck in the past .
i would like to see a comment from someone
who had never seen basic instinct 1 
perhaps someone very young ?
i left the cinema feeling glad
that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewer .
14 hour later i am still trying to find flaw in the plot
but i can not think of anything serious .
my advice to everyone is see it for yourself
and make up your own mind.it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1
but the plot is less confused .
it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way .
sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 year extremely well ;
this remains her defining role .
david morrisey was satisfactory
even though he is no michael douglas .
of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective .
