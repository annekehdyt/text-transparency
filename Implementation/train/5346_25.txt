yes 
the camera were in the right place at the right time .
it is so interesting to see how a world leader
( like chavez )
who supports the poor person in his country ,
can be held in such low esteem in the us .
his worst `` sin '' 
in my opinion 
is caring about those
who are at the bottom of the barrel .
what can be so bad about that ?
i have always been fascinated by the us government+medium reaction to fidel castro .
at first 
castro was a good guy
( around 1959 )
when he supplanted batista .
soon 
however 
castro started turning the corporation in cuba toward the need of the poor instead of the fat cat .
we are a decent country ,
but why does our medium and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor ?
if these guy are `` dictator 
''
then we could use more `` dictatorhips ''
especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world .
