this is the kind of movie
that wants to be good but suck .
first thing 
what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school ?
i think
the kid does not seem to realize the gravity of the situation .
deker guy say to the girl
that they under his responsibility
when she ask why
he wants to go back for them but right
after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude
and wants him to go alone repair the phone line .
where is the responsibility there ?
i understand
poor actor must pay their food
but why not just give them the money
that takes
to make a stupid movie like that
or give that money to a charity .
oh yea and none of them knows how to aim .
the stupid punk guy shoot in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy .
they all want to look professional
but they all suck .
one more thing i do not believe
that there is no emergency exit in the school
the kid are trying several door
but they all locked .
what happens
if there is a fire
and the dumass security guard
is dead ?
it is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school .
anyway there is a lot more to say
but it would be too long .
i spent some time of my life to watch a crap .
