corbin bernsen 's sent letter to four criminal associate
he is worked with in the past
and it is a real intergenerational mix with fred gwynne 
lou diamond phillip 
william russ 
and ruben blade .
they are to meet him in this obscure montana town
and he does not explain
why
because he is then picked up by out of state polouse from new jersey on a warrant .
of the criminal group
that is been gathered together ,
they all know bernsen ,
but do not know each other .
a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out .
as the oldest gwynne though denying
it kind of takes charge with the other grumbling ,
but going along .
especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind.as for bernsen ,
he is got the good fortune
to be picked up by a pair of bumbler in ed o'neill and daniel roebuck .
he gets the drop on o'neill and escapes.after
that it is the four criminal trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the polouse .
in the intricately plotted screenplay 
it is fascinating how both story line keep intertwining with each other .
hoyt axton as the local sheriff watch in amazement at what unfolds in his town.disorganized crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of player
who seem mostly to have had a background in television
or would soon .
i can not say
that anyone stood out in the cast
they also seem to click so well together .
ironically none of these person are comedian per se ,
but they all exhibit a light comic touch
that good directing ought out .
disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie 
the kind of film
that well known pessimist mr. murphy
would have written .
