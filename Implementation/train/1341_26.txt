this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense film
and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale .
a young couple receives an inheritance
that
they believe
will make them happy .
they spend the money
traveling about the world
and living a very hedonistic existence .
however 
after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence .
however 
out of no where ,
when they are on a luxury cruise ,
the ship sink and they lose everything
-- and end up much happier in the end
because they now appreciate life !
what an odd 
silly and preachy film !
personally 
i would like to inherit all
that money and find out
if it makes me miserable !
the production value are relatively poor
compared to later production
-- a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .
