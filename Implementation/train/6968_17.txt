i think
this movie is well done and realistic .
i you are used
to watching hollywood `` action '' movie ,
and use
that as a standard to rate this movie ,
you are bound to be disappointed .
this movie is much closer to real life than 95 % of what hollywood can produce ,
and that is what lifts it above the average action movie .
i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever ,
and can therefore not point out any mistake in the way
they act .
but as i have seen the `` making of '' extra i am convinced
that there has been done a lot
to avoid any mistake .
this is a movie i will recommend for other to watch .
high quality realistic story and movie .
