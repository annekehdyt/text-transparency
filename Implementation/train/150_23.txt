i thought
this movie was terrible .
i am chinese ,
so i thought
everything was totally wrong .
many of the fact were incorrect .
the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was
when wendy 's mother explained to her husband about the statue
that guarded shihuangdi .
i also thought
the fight scene were very cheesy and fake .
many of the actor and actress were not very great .
some of the joke
that were supposedly `` funny ''
were really stupid .
i think
this movie should receive the worst possible rating
it could get .
disney has really got to get more information about chinese history
if they want to create an extravagant movie .
mulan was quite accurate .
watch this movie
if you want to waste some time .
