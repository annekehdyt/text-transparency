i really liked this version of 'vanishing point '
as opposed to the 1971 version .
i found the 1971 version quite boring .
if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few time
( as i did with the 1971 version )
than to me ,
it is not all that great .
of course 
this could be due to the fact
that i was only nine at the time
the 1971 version was ought out .
however 
i have seen many remake ,
where i have liked the original and older one better .
i found
that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable
and had basically kept true to the original
without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version .
in my opinion 
i felt
the 1997 version had more excitement
and was not so `` blase '' .
( boring )
