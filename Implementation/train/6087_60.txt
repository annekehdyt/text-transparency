this week 
i just thought
it would be fun to catch up with corey haim ,
with just having seen the two `` lost boy '' film last week and all .
not that i am a fan-boy - not by far -
but i did like those two corey in some film back in my early teen days.so ,
i prepared myself for three film starring him .
unfortunately 
i picked `` dream machine '' as a first
( never seen it before ) ,
and it was so godawfully horrible ,
i just decided to lock corey back in my closet
and let him sober up again first ,
before i pop in something else of his .
but i managed to struggle my way through this film first .
i had the impression
it desperately wanted to play in the same league as `` ferris bueller 's day off ''
( 1986 )
but got caught up in its own delusion .
practically the whole film
it wants to be a comedy and near the end
it hopelessly tries to be a thriller .
the only good thing about `` dream machine '' is the premise :
a dead body in the trunk of a porsche .
all the rest fails so badly ,
it is embarrassing .
even the most for haim .
i can dig him being his young 
enthusiastic self ,
but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guideline .
this clearly was not the case in `` dream machine '' .
so 
we have a perfect car 
yes ,
that black porsche .
haim 's perfect girlfriend ?
just a blonde chick
who hardly has any line in the film .
the perfect murder ... almost ?
some dude
that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film ,
trying the whole movie
to steal the body back out of the trunk ,
never really succeeds ,
and then at the end of the film thinks
he is michael myer
( minus the white william shatner mask )
and mistakes corey haim for jamie lee curtis .
do not think
they could have made this flick any lamer
if
they tried .
a stupid 
unfunny film with a story
that leads to nowhere directed by a director
that does not know how to direct his cast .
great accomplishment ! one last question for mr. haim :
who 's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie ?
your or the director 's ?
so not done .
