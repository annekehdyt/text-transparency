in my book `` basic instinct '' was a perfect film .
it had outstanding acting on the part of stone 
dougla and all the supporting actor to the tiniest role .
it had marvelous photography 
music and the noirest noir script ever .
all of it adding up to a film
that is as good
as it will ever get !
this sequel is the exact opposite ,
it can not possibly get worse ,
bad acting and a lame script ,
combined with totally inept direction ,
this is really bad 
boring 
annoying .
the only thing
that somewhat keeps
you concentrated
is the relatively short wait for the next scene
that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original .
these copy are so bad
they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself ,
because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument .
the only thing
that is good in this horrible mess
are the excerpt of the jerry goldsmith score of bi1 .
michael caton-jone and the half-wit responsible for the script
even included the `` there is no smoking in this room '' dialog in the interrogation scene
and yes
she sends her attorney
( who is now a solicitor )
away !
i am sorry i have seen this awful film
that should have never been made !
it does damage to the original ,
so bad is it .
the only redeeming value is the realization
that cosmetic surgery
( and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy )
can do a good job
but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original .
and what concerns the human body apply to film-making 
too .
there should be a law :
do not ever make a sequel to a perfect film !
