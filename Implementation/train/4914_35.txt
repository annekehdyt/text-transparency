in too-tight 
garish clothe 
gold chain 
and an ugly haircut .

writer and director richard shepard did the qanda after this delightful movie at the austin film festival .
shepard was also down on his luck .
after suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent script ,
he decided to write a story no one would buy
and create a character no one would want to play .
then pierce brosnan called .
brosnan regains his equiliium in this movie .
( there is life after bond ! )
he has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy .
do not miss it .
stay for the closing credit
to read
what the filmmaker say about bullfighting .
i look forward to more of richard shepard 's project .
