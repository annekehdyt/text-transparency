this filmed presentation of `` the rime of the ancient mariner '' is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of coleridge 's haunting poem .
the striking cinematography ,
combined with a collection of two century of effort
to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artist ,
and michael redgrave 's superb narration 
are very well worth the time
to view this excellent visual work.in the age of television ,
such work as this is an invaluable tool
to induce young student 
as well as adult ,
to explore
and to learn the value of great poetry .
to the best of my knowledge 
this kind of work is indeed rare ;
that is regrettable .
as a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic counselor 
i feel
that more great epic poem like coleridge 's `` rime of the ancient mariner '' should be so `` translated . ''
although not a movie critic ,
but as an avid reader of classic literature ,
i am glad to recommend this fine production
without any reservation whatsoever .
