i remembered this
as being one of my favorite book as a child
and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now .
i knew
the movie was coming out soon
so we went to the liary
to get the book
and they gave us preview pass for the next day !
we rushed home
and spent the afternoon
reading the book
so we could compare .
was not necessary .
the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main character ' first name ,
the fact
that there is a bet ,
and a whole lot of worm eating .
oh yeah 
i almost forgot 
the kid
who cooks most of the worm likes
to present his masterpiece with a french accent .
how the kid know each other 
the number of kid involved ,
how the bet came about 
the number of worm
that must be eaten ,
the time frame
in which he has to eat the worm ,
how they are cooked 
progression of friendship 
climax scene 
etc. ,
nothing is the same .
but somehow 
it did not ruin the movie for me .
the character are all enjoyable ,
and the film did not leave me disappointed .
word of caution for parent 
there was one moment
when you could hear the adult in the room collectively draw their eath
and that was when billy 's little other referred to his penis as a `` dilly dick '' .
the embarrassing part came
when my daughter proceeded to ask those
sitting around us ,
`` does anybody know
what a dilly dick is ? ''
lol .
that and an occasional `` shut up '' is as foul mouthed as this film gets .
my daughter thought
she might get sick around worm 3 and 4
( and was holding the empty nacho container just in case )
but was fine by worm 6.
she and i both really enjoyed the film
and had a wonderful time sharing the experience .
