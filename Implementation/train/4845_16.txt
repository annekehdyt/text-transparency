so often with stephen king adaptation ,
you just get a collection of character reciting dialogue from the book .
this really captures the heart of the book .
maybe
because they do not use large chunk of text straight from the book ,
but it is a bit more of an improv of the event in the story .
a big part of its success is miko hughe as baby gage .
dale midkiff and denise `` tasha yar '' crosby really act like his parent .
there is a scene
where louis is cuddling gage ,
and they are very natural together .
fred gwynne is wonderful .
he nails the maine accent perfectly
without lapsing into parody ,
and is wise and warm just like jud should be .
