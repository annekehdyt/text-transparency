the main reason
to see this film
is warren william ,
who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager .
he is electric ,
constantly finding way to fool the public
and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disaster .
william is a great actor
-- i feel
he never got his due .
bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role .
personally 
i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame-ained candidate
that william and the other are trying to foist on the public .
he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person .
i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non-character .
the story itself is implausible 
silly and clich\u00e9d .
but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching .
