there is only one thing i am
going to say about cat in the hat ... as a kid movie and a good comedy movie it sucks ... i lost track
of how many terrible joke in the movie
that not only sucked
but were not exactly kid appropriate .
oh and by the way
the way
the cat in the hat talked was annoying ...
as for the plot i completely forgot .
who cares it sucked anyway .
i am not sure
why mike myer joined but i think
the writer were trying to make it sound like him in austin power
without the swinger talk
and it overly succeeded-
but so what it was annoying .
do not see it-it belong in the bottom 100 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... the joke are so unkiddy
it is funny
