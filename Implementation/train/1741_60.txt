dan 
the widowed father of three girl 
has his own advice column
that will probably go into syndication .
after his wife 's death 
he has taken time
to raise his daughter .
having known no romance in quite some time ,
nothing prepare him for the encounter with the radiant marie 
at a local book store in a rhode island small town on the ocean ,
where he has gone to celeate thanksgiving with the rest of his big family .
after liking marie at first sight 
little prepare him
when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound .
after all 
she is the date of dan 's other ,
mitch.it is clear from the outset
that dan and marie are made for one another ,
and although we sense what the outcome will be ,
we go for the fun ride
that peter hedge 
the director wants to give us .
mr. hedge 
an author and screenplay writer on his own 
has given us two excellent novel ,
`` what is eating gilber grape '' ,
and `` an ocean in iowa '' 
and the delightful indie 
`` piece of april ,
which he also directed .
it is just a coincidence that both movie deal with family during thanksgiving reunions.the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two star 
steve carell and juliette binoche .
mr. carell 
in fact 
keeps getting better all the time .
in many way 
he remind us of jack lemmon 
in his take of comedy and serious material .
what can one say about ms. binoche 
an intelligent actress 
and a ight presence in any film .
she proves
she is right up
to doing comedy ,
convincing us about her marie.the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture .
john mahoney 
diane wiest 
norbert leo butz 
jessica hecht 
emily blunt 
allison pill 
amy ryan 
have nothing to do .
they just serve as incidental music for decoration .
dane cook ,
who is seen as other mitch ,
fare better
because he gets to recite more line than the other .
`` dan in real life '' is a delightful film
that will please everyone .
