great mystery ,
but the film goes down hill from there .
the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer 
edward .
he is traumatized over this
and is seen popping pill .
a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend
asking for help
in finding her missing daughter .
so ed travel to an island commune of mainly woman .
they do not like outsider .
a lot of filler is with ed shown
looking around town for the girl .
that made the movie too long .
it finally gets a little better toward the end
when we learn of the crazy ritual the woman perform
and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward.overall 
not a well written story and too long .
final verdict :
i would skip this .
