i am a massive fan of jet li !
he is the best hk action film star alive ...
and consequently - this film rocked !
i saw it in the video store and ,
as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store ,
i didnt register its presence at first ,
and had to look twice .
i immediately knew
what i would be renting out .
my only qualm
( i suppose i expected it )
is that it was dubbed
( aaargh )
and not subtitled .
elsewise 
the movie 's original/strange/cool plot 
and full on action made it one of jet li 's better movie ...
even though they all fall under that category ... .
