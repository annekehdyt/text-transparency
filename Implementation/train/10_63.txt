ronald colman plays a famous broadway actor
who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity .
after year of playing a wide range of part ,
he can not remember
who he exactly is
-- who are his role
and who is the self .
and 
much more serious 
he begins to see
and hear his play even in regular everyday life .
so ,
since he is currently playing in `` othello '' ,
he begins to act jealous and suspicious
-- just like the title character .
ultimately 
it leads him to the depth of insanity and murder.i saw this film year ago and liked it .
i just saw it again and loved it .
now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because i have always liked ronald colman
and this is a great triumph for him
-- and for which he earned the best actor oscar .
and 
looking at the competition that year
( gregory peck for gentleman 's agreement 
john garfield for body and soul 
william powell for life with father and michael redgrave for mourning become electra ) ,
i think
colman was a very good choice ,
as he stretched from his usual comfort zone
and did a much more demanding role.now i noticed
that one reviewer hated this film
because they hated shakespeare
-- and this took up about half their review
talking about their dislike for him .
however 
this film is not really about shakespeare ,
and it does not matter at all if you dislike shakespeare .
i am no huge fan of shakespeare ,
but marveled at the small portion of the play
that colman re-enacted
-- though ,
as i said ,
this is not a really movie about shakespeare .
instead 
it is a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind
and mixing his stage role with reality .
it could have been any play ,
though `` othello '' was an excellent choice
because of the murder scene
-- which gets acted out for real later in the film.overall 
a very clever film due to a lovely script --
with some overtone of film noir .
fortunately 
the acting was terrific also ,
as colman had excellent support from signe hasso 
shelly winter and edmond o'brien
( who was particularly good
-- he played his part just right ) .
and ,
considering
the great george cukor was directing ,
it is no wonder
it is a wonderful film from start to finish .
