some of the filmmaker
who are participating in this series
have made some really great film
but they sure
as heck are not showing much skill with this series .
particularly the writing .
ok 
the first season was somewhat better
but these new episode they are creating just stink .
i am a huge fan of horror and in my opinion
the vast majority of these episode are total garbage .
nothing new or genuinely interesting .
few of them are visually creative .
it is just typical faicated hollywood crap 
uninteresting 
childish ,
poorly conceived and in some case ,
flat out laughable .
much like tale from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity !
other then that this series blows hard .
i get the impression sometimes
that they hired a bunch of eighth-grader
to write the episode .
maybe they did .
