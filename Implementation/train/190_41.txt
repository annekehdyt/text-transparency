uwe boll has done the impossible :
create a game adaptation
that stays at least somewhat true to the game ;
he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content .
so ,
as an adaptation ,
it is a success.unfortunately ,
it is still uwe boll we are dealing with here ,
so do not expect the movie to be actually any good .
while it does have it is moment ,
`` postal '' wear out his welcome very fast
and becomes a pain
to sit through.at its core ,
postal is a satire on the united state ,
as done by a twelve year old kid .
boll seems to think
that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value :
the more offensive 
the funnier 
and the more exaggerated the funnier .
this result in a movie
that sets new level of tastelessness
while being extremely hit and mis .
yes 
some gag do work
but it seems to be pure luck .
high point include the director satirizing himself ,
and person getting hit very violently by truck and other vehicle .
low point include..well pretty much everything else.after the initial surprise wear off ,
postal simply becomes a bore to watch .
yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minute ,
but everything else consists of horde of annoying character shooting
and chasing each other all over the place
for what seems to be an eternity.this probably
would have worked as a short movie ,
but it is just not enough content for something
that lasts over 90 minute
( although it feels twice as long ) .
there are nice idea and nice try ,
but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scene and content
that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10
