i very much enjoyed watching this film .
i taped it
while watching so that i could review it later .
i actually enjoyed the second viewing
more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between natalie and adam 
the 2 main character .
i thought
the way this story evolved was very thought provoking .
i got very intrigued with how natalie was going to interact with her daughter 's friend ,
at first it seemed
that she was going to spew a lot of animosity
but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see
how this visit was going to unfold .
i was not disappointed .
gradually the secret
that sara kept from her mother
started to reveal a daughter
who was not so perfect ,
a flawed human being like most of us
who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother
who thought
she knew her daughter
but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner
that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom .
the viewer
who stuck with this film to the end
saw a very touching performance from diane keaton
( who is always wonderful 
even in some of her less well received films-think town and country ) .
the closing scene of diane keaton driving home was well worth waiting for ,
revealing
that anyone
who loves another human being has got
to learn
that we have to live our own life ,
we love other but do not own them and ultimately we have to let go .
it is a hard lesson but well worth
contemplating now and then.thank you cbs for this oadcast ,
it was worth the long wait .
