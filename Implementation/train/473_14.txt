i just watched this movie .
in one word :
sucky !
the story is bad ,
the acting is ,
if possible 
even worse .
the movie has one or two nice moment ,
but thats it
and having those two small good moment ,
does not make up for anything in between ,
before or after those moment .
a montrocity of a movie 
not even worth watching on tv ...
