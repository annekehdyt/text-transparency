the premise of this anime series is about ead 
of all thing
to base a plot on !
i truly laughed .
the main character has a special ead making power
that he was born with ,
and he goes off to ead baking school .
i wish it were available on dvd ,
and it does not matter
if it is subtitled or dubbed -
it is that good .
even the theme song alone is funny .
at one point in the theme song 
there is an african-japanese man with an afro on horseback ,
wielding a french baguette
as if it were a samurai sword .
these image will not make sense unless you see the anime .
you will laugh until your side hurt .
it is definitely the most unique anime i
have seen thus far .
