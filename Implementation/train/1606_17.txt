i have been reading post here
concerning wonder woman 's costume for this tv movie .
it should be pointed out at the time
the movie was made ,
she was not wearing her traditional outfit .
the producer were actually sticking to the comic book writer 's conception of ww for the early seventies.as for the movie itself ,
i have to agree with many of the other poster here .
snoozefest !
i was a kid
when it appeared on abc in 1974 ,
so i was at the right age
to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero .
yet i was so `` engrossed '' with the plot ,
i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie.of course ,
i was not at the right age
to appreciate cathy lee !
