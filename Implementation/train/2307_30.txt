`` twelve monkey '' 's got all the element
to become terry gilliam 's masterpiece .
an outstanding screenplay 
a sustained rhythm 
clever sometimes ironic dialog .
moreover 
he had a good nose about the cast .
`` twelve monkey '' is also the first movie
where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character
he used to play in his previous movie .
here 
a jaded and hopeless character
which you could nickname a prisoner
took over from a fearless and invincible hero
( as it was the case in `` die hard '' ) .
no matter
how he tries ,
he is a prisoner of the time .
the movie contains a very thrilling end too .
it is got a real dramatic power .
but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man ,
the danger he dreads
( notably 
the one
that could cause the end of the world and here ,
these are virus
that can create illness ) .
no matter how long it will take ,
`` twelve monkey '' will be estimated at its true value :
one of the masterpiece made in the ninety .
