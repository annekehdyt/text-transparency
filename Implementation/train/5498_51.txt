i do not know
what you guy are inhaling ,
but please stop .
this movie was complete trash.macaulay culkin
as kevin mccallister was lovable 
cute 
sweet 
loving 
and extremely fun to watch .
he had that innocence but at the same time 
he was strong as well.this new kid 
alex ?
annoying as all hell !
just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin 's charm and grace 
failing miserably at that.the villain 
complete crap .
harry and marv 
they were such an entertaining on screen team .
they were comedic ,
they were humorous ,
and just made you really want to root for culkin even more ,
which is what a good villain is suppose to do .
these guy joe pesci and daniel stern 
absolutely perfect for those role .
on the other hand 
in 3 
we have 4 new idiot
that just bicker and again ,
try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villain .
not saying they were horrible ,
but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining .
more on the corny side actually.then we got the actual movie .
part 1 and 2 
classic .
memorable .
perfect to watch around christmas and ings a wonderful christmas feeling
and ings out so many emotion .
it makes you fall in love with the story 
and care about the character .
simply 
memorable and close to being masterpiece .
part 3 ?
masterpiece of crap .
enough said.all and all 
i do not know why person like this .
i think
person really do not know what a good movie is anymore .
its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic trap and a stupid new main character kid
that i wish the robber would of at least beat the crap out of.run ,
run away from this garbage .
and lets not even start with part 4 !
