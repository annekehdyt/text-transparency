nothing like a movie about a group of friend
who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing ,
but they have little to no redeeming quality
to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the character either .
there are movie
so bad they are good
( a la ed wood or tod slaughter film ) ,
and there is just plain bad
( like 99 % of uwe boll 's `` work '' ) .
this film is barely tolerable
even if you are a illiantly talented mstie riffer
( e.g. 
mystery science theatre 3000 ) .
thankfully
while i am rather talented in that regard
( it is how my mind works all the time ) ,
for those
who are not so naturally talented in mstie riffing ,
eventually into *this* film
you will just want to pull your own head off ,
painfully aware the movie `` taboo '' robs you of about an hour and twenty minute
you will never get back .
even my mstie talent were barely a match for this slow paced 
boring waste of time .
the most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded
it ... i
rented `` taboo '' solely for the normally talented amber benson ,
who clearly
must have been blackmailed into doing this film .
i have another lesser known film of her in my rental queue 
the review
to which i would better read first .
ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location .
