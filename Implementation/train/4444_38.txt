i am an avid b-rate horror film buff
and have viewed my fair share of slasher picture ,
so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by .
it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror film
the 1980 's has to offer .
it is not as scary as night of the demon ,
it is not as gory as re-animator
and lacks the camp value of there is nothing out there .
that being said ,
this film has no value .
keep in mind ,
the movie artwork is for a completely different film .
the still shot on the back of the dvd box are not taken from this film.violence :
$ $ $
( there is plenty of violence
but we have seen it all before .
a murderer kill nubile student and the occasional facility member by slitting throat and all the other tired method of murder
that horror film utilize )
.nudity :
none story :
$ $
( the story focuses on francine forbe -
who wisely changed her name to forbe riley
after this film was made -
who accepts a job teaching at a university .
person start to die and forbe believes
the killer is targeting her .
is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student ?
to be honest ,
it is impossible to care
because the script does not flesh out any character outside forbe )
.acting : $
( terrible on all level .
this slasher has the feel of a school production -high school
that is because college student could make a better flick than this .
forbe showcases a modicum of talent
as does seminara as one of the student ,
but everyone else is of the `` extra '' caliber of acting ) .
