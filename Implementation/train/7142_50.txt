if i had not read pat barker 's 'union street '
before seeing this film ,
i would have liked it .
unfortuntately this is not the case .
it is actually my kind of film ,
it is well made ,
and in no way do i want to say otherwise ,
but as an adaptation ,
it fails from every angle.the harrowing novel about the reality
of living in a northern england working-class area
grabbed hold of my heartstring
and refused to let go for week
after i had finished .
i was put through tear 
repulsion 
shock 
anger 
sympathy and misery
when reading about the woman of union street .
excellent .
a novel
that at time i felt
i could not read any more of ,
but i novel i simply could not put down .
depressing yes 
but utterly gripping.the film .
oh dear .
hollywood took barker 's truth and reality 
and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it .
a beautiful film 
an inspiring soundtrack 
excellent performance 
a tale of hope and romance ... yes .
an adaptation of 'union street ' ... no.the woman of union street and their story are condensed into fonda 's character ,
their story are touched on ,
but many are discarded .
i accept
that some of barker 's tale are sensitive issue
and are too horrific for mass viewing ,
and that a film with around 7 leading protagonist just is not practical ,
but the content is not my main issue .
the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain 
oken window covered with cardboard ,
and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine 
pretty house ,
and a twinkling william 's score.if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality ' ,
i advise
that you hesitate to read the book
without first preparing yourself for something more like 'schindler 's list ' ...
but without the happy ending .
