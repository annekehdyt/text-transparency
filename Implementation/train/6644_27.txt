note to previous reviewer :
this movie is `` science-fiction adaptation of the iliad ''
according to the screenwriter .
so whether
the reference are painful or not 
no apology ,
it is the basis for the film .
they admit
they stole ...
though adapted is the p.c .
term.great flick but too short .
probably did not come out as well as the author 
director 
or studio wanted 
but pretty damn fun .
the fact
that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.a big-budget remake
would not be as fun ,
and probably would not do the screenplay any more justice .
but it is fun to dream about the potential there .
a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available
but i do not think
it would play on ntsc player .
i am no expert
and thus still trying to figure this out .
for now 
i live with the vhs incarnation .
