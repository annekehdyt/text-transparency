i really can not understand
how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star ...
how can you like such a retarded film ,
where all the animal abuse scene are real ?
i do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living being felt in those horrific moment ... jesus ...
what kind of ''human '' would torture them like that for no reason 
or just for money ?
i tell you ,
that director is either mentally retarded ,
or he is just a monster with a ''heart '' of stone .
or both .
he truly deserves to get his hand cut off and burn alive.it contains various horribly barbaric scene
that may cause shock 
especially to sensitive person and child :
a real frog is skinned alive ,
fish are sadistically mutilated
and thrown back into the water ,
a dog is beaten ,
bird are thrown into the water ...
this movie is more than awful ;
it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made 
along with another one ,
called ''cannibal holocaust '' or something like that .
i will never watch or buy any film
directed by this heartless monster .
no one should waste their time watching it ,
especially when there are a lot of truly great movie out there ,
in which all the animal abuse scene are staged.fortunately ,
only a few person liked this -
which is natural ,
since it is the worst film ever - ,
so it was not successful .
i hope this will make the retarded director realize
that such unjustified barbaric act of extreme cruelty and violence to real animal will never be praised ,
and that he will stage all the animal abuse scene in his following film .
i truly believe
that everyone receife but what they give !
there will be a day
when all the retarded and cruel ''human '' will feel the same pain
they once inflicted to others.this 
however ,
is probably my only ''negative '' review .
i usually do not comment on a movie
if i dislike it ,
but this time i just could not shut up .
i had to speak the truth ,
because animal abuse must stop !
