in life 
we first organize stone
( piedra in spanish )
such as a career 
family 
friendship 
and love .
in this way 
we shall find space between these
to fit smaller stone 
our small necessity .
if you act in an inverse way ,
you will not have enough room for larger stone .
the five protagonist in this film are woman
who have not been able to organize the large `` stone '' in their life .
ramon salazar 
a spanish motion picture director defines his first feature stone in this way .
the film tells the parallel ,
conflicting trajectory of five woman :
anita
( monica cervera 
1975- ) 
isabel
( angela molina 
1955- ) 
adela
( antonia san juan 
1961- ) 
leire
( najwa nimri 
1972- ) ,
and maricarman
( vicky pena 
1954- )
.all are endeavoring to remove the stone
that insistently appear in their path or 
worst ,
that are in their shoe .
they are five cinderella in search of prince charming and a new chance in life .
the best story of these five cinderella is that of anita
( monica cervera )
who also stars in `` 20 centimeter 
'' `` busco 
'' `` criman ferpecto 
'' `` entre vivir y sonar 
'' `` hongos 
'' and `` octavia . ''
