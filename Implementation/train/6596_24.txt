ever
since seeing this film as a child 
over 30 year ago ,
i never tire of watching it .
from the opening scene in the horn factory 
to the car motor running from the back seat of the car ,
to ollie answering the phone
and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan ,
i think
this was perhaps their best latter day film .
after this they moved to 20th century fox ,
and
while those film were not terrible ,
they lacked the comic timing of this movie .
jimmy finnlayson 
their long time foil 
in his last appearance with the boy ,
showing up
as the doctor is super !
quote :
`` i said
goat milk `` his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost !
charlie hall and even ben turpin show up !
i would say all in all one of my favorite l and h comedy .
