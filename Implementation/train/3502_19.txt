the movie opens upon julian sand ,
lying on his back ,
a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it ,
about two foot above him .
that was so provocative ,
and i thought ,
`` here we go !
a good vampire movie ! ''
and then it died .
that was literally the only scene
which captured any part of the imagination .
it was slow 
uneventful drivel thereafter .
i was vastly disappointed ,
as my previous experience with sand ' acting was quite enjoyable .
however 
this attempt was obviously misdirected
and the screenplay left a lot
to be desired.even julian sand 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.it rate a 1.1/10 from ... the fiend : .
