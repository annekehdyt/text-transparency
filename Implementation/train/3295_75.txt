mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke .
you have no idea
what is happening on the screen with the irritating theme song `` suzanne ''
being played over and over throughout the movie
until when `` the second coming of suzanne '' is over you already know it by hard no matter
how hard you try to forget the whole thing.this off-the-wall armature movie maker logan 
jared martin ,
is out
to make the movie of the century
but is so rude and obnoxious
that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project .
planning to go on his own logan
then spots this couple at a seaside caf\u00e9
and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne 
sandra locke ,
who reminds him of someone
he knew in another life :
jesus christ.with logan 's assistant and all around gofer clavius 
richard dreyfuss 
somehow getting a $ 740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance logan 's masterpiece
he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress
in order to get her interested to be in his film .
this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon 
paul sand ,
but later simon being so depressed
and feeling
all alone takes a gun to his mouth
and blows his ain out.the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub-plot
in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy 
kari avalos ,
who 's cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else ,
at the psychiatric hospital
that she was committed to 
failed .
it is not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital
but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there ;
was this supposed to show us in the audience
that she 
like jesus 
could miraculously heal the sick ?
there is also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair 
gene barry ,
who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision
that changed his life forever .
sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well
as what it is all about all through the movie
and wanted to know
why there is all this suffering in the world 
like this movie
that he is in ,
and seemed to have found the answer
when he first laid his eye on suzanne .
sinclair also got some sense
knocked into his head
when his private chauffeur david 
mark rasmusser ,
who 's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucination
almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast.the movie `` the second coming of suzanne '' goes on with a number of unrelated sequence ,
probably to fill or pad in some time
by it is director and film editor ,
and then goes to it is final scene in a christ-like crucification on a hill
as logan has all the camera rolling .
it turns out
that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece
as he tried to replicate ,
on the helpless
and tied up suzanne 
the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2,000 year ago.hard
to sit through and almost impossible
to follow `` the second coming of suzanne '' puts you through the same kind torture
that suzanne is put through by logan and the maker of the film .
the movie tries to be arty
but that is just an excuse
to cover up
it is ainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it .
