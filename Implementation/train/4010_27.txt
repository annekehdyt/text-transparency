this show is freaking hilarious !
the joke are original 
god and i love eric and kelso !
yeah i know
what they say ,
after the 8th season it is not funny anymore
because eric and kelso are no longer in the show ,
and randy is a real dumbass .
randy is 
comparing to eric and kelso .
you can not take the funniest character
and switch em with `` i am a cool guy '' kind of guy
( randy ) .
it is not his fault anyway ,
but the writer are trying to keep the 8th season funny ,
it is still is 
not as much as the earlier season ,
but its alright.the 360 's are awesome ,
the circle 
red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad : )
and kitty is always half-high half-pie .
hyde try to be cool all the time ,
he has his moment too .
the least favrioutes character are jackie and donna .
they are cool ,
but not without kelso and eric.great show .
dumbass !
