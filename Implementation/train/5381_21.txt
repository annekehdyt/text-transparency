a movie/documentary about different person in austria on the hottest weekend of the year .
it follows what they are doing
and maybe more what they are not doing .
the tempo is very quiet ... ...
so you have to relax ... ... .eathe in ... eathe out
before you see it ... ...
first you think
... .but nothing is happening
and you get a little angry over that..and
that the problem ,
because its the mood of the film and the really nice social realistic picture which are nice in this film ... ... ... ..a lot of person will say its disgusting ... ... but its not that bad ... i think its more used for the marketing ... .and there is some really funny moment ... a 60 old woman stripping ... ..i guarantee its the most unsexy striptease in film history ... ... its movie
which is real..i think
that the word ... ... right up in your face ... ... .and
that makes it a bit scary.no computer manipulation here ... ..its real life ...
and as we all know movie can win over reality when it comes to doing sick thing ... ... ... .so its much worse in the real world ... ... .if you survive the movie
you can start to look at your neighbor
and think ... maybe they are like the person in the movie ... i bet there is a lot of them out there ... ...
sick ... crazy person
living with a nice facade ... ...
..after seing the movie i feel its more interesting to look at my neighbor ... ...
..but maybe you shouldnt see this movie on your first date ... ... ...
