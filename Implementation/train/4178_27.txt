the first time i saw this `` film '' i loved it .
when i was 11 ,
i was more interested in the music and dancing .
as i have grown older ,
i have become more interested in the acting as well .
while the first half is just a retrospective of michael 's career
( from the jackson 5 up to `` bad '' ) ,
it was still entertaining to watch .
the `` badder '' sequence could have been left out ,
though the kid were pretty good .
`` speed demon ''
and `` leave me alone ''
were funny ,
especially when the police officer tells michael ,
`` i need your autograph right here '' ,
after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone .
but it is `` smooth criminal ''
that is the icing on the cake .
joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie
( and that hair was wild ) .
the dancing is perfect ,
and so are the special effect .
the only thing i could have done
without was the spider .
any fan of michael 's should see this ,
if you have not already .
i give it a 10+ !
