i usually check out the mtv movie award
to watch a witty ,
entertaining show
that delivers a unique award show
( chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example ) .
so this year was no different .
while i am not a fan of justin timberlake ,
seann william scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me .
i have laughed at stiffler in both american pie movie ,
and even enjoyed him in dude where is my car ? .
but the mtv movie award were simply horrible .
nothing was coherrent 
humorous 
or entertaining .
justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing ;
he sure
as hell can not act.i am curious
as to who the writer were for this show .
last year 's performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny
( the lord of the ring parody alone was worth
watching the entire show ) ,
but this year was completly different .
did anyone understand timberlake 's comment
regarding luke wilson and kate hudson
( `` they are staring in a movie together ,
but have never met !
here they are ... '' )
where was the joke ?
kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue ,
never making a reference to the `` joke '' by timberlake .
and seann was completly wasted as a talent ,
not even causing me to smile ,
yet alone laugh .
and what was the point of harrison ford 's one-liner ?
did they make any sense to anyone ?
perhaps the mtv writer figured
the young viewer would only know the aging ford as han solo 
indiania jone 
or the president from air force one .
i am baffled .
and would someone tell me the deal with adrian brody ?
how old is this guy
and how old does
he think
he is ?
the guy looks 30 ,
trying to act 19 again ...
.give it up ,
show some class
( like in your best actor academy award speech )
and act your age ! i give this show 1 star out of 4 ,
simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance .
this was very creative ,
extremely well done ,
and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening .
