in my year of attending film festival 
i have seen many little film like this
that never get theatrical distribution ,
and they end up in the $ 3 bin at walmart .
i just found dvd of yank tank there 
great doc ,
but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.i loved this film ,
wish i would seen it at the cinema in it is everything .
i would have preferred
that new yorker film had translated the title directly .
it is good for american to stretch a little .
if the film 's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos ,
all the better .
cinema imitates life and visa versa.also 
i found it distracting
that the subtitle put price in dollar .
come on !
the euro is not hard to figure out ,
make the gringo audience do the math .
seeing a film ,
especially one shot in paris ,
the viewer should not have the effect spoiled
by being reminded :
i am an american watching a movie
and they are translating the euros into dollar for me .
looking forward to seeing more of these actor and more from the writer and director as well .
