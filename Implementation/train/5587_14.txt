`` the color purple '' 
is truly amazing .
there is none like it ,
and i do not think
there ever will be .
it is a roller coster of emotion and pain
that the viewer takes on .
the actor are flawless
and the directing is superb .
i absolutely loved it .
a movie has never made me so happy .
it is beautiful ,
that is the best way
to explain it .
