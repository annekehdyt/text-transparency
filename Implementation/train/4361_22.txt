this is the sorriest collection of clich\u00e9s ,
strung together on a straight line ,
with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i have seen in a long time .
canibalising scene from star war 
reign of fire 
godzilla 
lord of the ring and harry potter ,
it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence .
was this movie good ?
it was not a movie at all !
even if it does not go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy ,
the movie does offer some laugh .
the trick is to put the copied scene in the context of their original film .
gandalf can be funny talking korean ,
the basilisk looking snake hilarious
if you compare it to a kitten
and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jaja-bing 
or whatever his name was.bottom line :
any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewer 
not on the director/writer .
shame on you 
shim !
