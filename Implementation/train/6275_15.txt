i have read some of the comment about this film
and can only surmise
that some person are easily entertained .
this movie is nothing .
it is so badly written ,
directed and acted
that it barely makes an impression .
the character speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situation are completely implausible .
while that might make this campy and fun ,
it does not because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull .
it is as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality
but then she either was not allowed by studio execs
to give the story some true-to-life gusto
or did not have the cojone .
this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie .
