jeff lowell has written and directed 'over her dead body ' poorly .
the idea is first of all ,
is as stale as my joke
and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.minus eva longoria parker
there is hardly anything appealing in this film .
eva looks great as ever
and delivers a likable performance.paul rudd looks jaded and least interested .
lake bell is a complete miscast .
she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance .
jason biggs is wasted ,
so is lindsay sloane.i expected entertainment more from this film .
sadly 
i did not get entertained .
