the honey 
i shrunk the kid franchise was a huge deal
and not to mention very famous .
i loved honey 
i shrunk the kid
when i was little .
it was an original story
and had such an exciting plot !
the set were so amazing
and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other 's company .
now honey 
i blew up the kid was pretty stupid ,
so i think
they wanted to go back to the story
that everyone loved.basically 
adam is a little more grown up now
and the mom 's are going on vacation to leave their husband with their child .
but when wayne 's favorite item is threatened for the garbage ,
he wants to shrink it
and keep it ,
but he and his other get in the way .
but when the wife come back after forgetting to give some med to their son ,
they get caught in the machine as well ,
leaving the kid in the house alone !
the plot is silly ,
but like i said ,
it was just a family film
that i think
some might get a kick out of .
the original honey 
i shrunk the kid is the best ,
i think
everyone could agree .
the third one was not so bad ,
i would recommend this one at least over honey ,
i blew up the kid movie ,
it was at least a little more fun.4/10
