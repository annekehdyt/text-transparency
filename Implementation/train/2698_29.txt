the temp
( 1993 )
did not do much theatrical business ,
but here is the direct-to-video rip-off
you did not want 
anyway !
ellen bradford
( mel harris )
is the new woman at millennium investment 
a high scale okerage firm ,
who starts getting helpful hint from wide-eyed secretary deidre
( sheila kelley ) .
deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy 's girl
who will stop at nothing
to move up the corporate ladder ,
including screwing a top oker
she can not stand and murdering anyone
who gets on her bad side .
she digs up skeleton in ellen 's closet ,
try to cause problem with her husband
( barry bostwick ) ,
kill
while making it look like
she is responsible ,
kidnaps her daughter and try to get her to embezzle money from the company.harris and kelley deliver competent performance ,
the supporting cast is alright
and it is reasonably well put-together ,
but that does not fully compensate for a script
that travels down a well-worn path and offers few surprise .
