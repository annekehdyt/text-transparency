this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day .
a wealthy upper class english woman scheme 
plot and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction .
she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activity of a decidedly anti-social kind .
there is a clever sex-role reversal
as her activity prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male character .
but naturally there is a tall 
dark and handsome stranger
to keep up the love interest ,
and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward
when she meets the right man.the wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme ,
but those
who thirst for romance
will overlook that .
