i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t.r .
took me on to the journey -
well i disliked the big glued thumb in the beginning ,
but the absurd humor it and the gordious look of both sissy actor - i do not know
who played the young her -
but she was great
and so was uma ! ! !
-the two other person
who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour ,
i was with a friend -
and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friend - and ,
we both enjoyed it too the maximum - hilarious laugh - sadness about the `` realistic police- normalos '' .
both of us fan of t.robbin book ... i found
it well done - thought ,
that robbin would also approve ,
though i do not have an idea
if he likes the film or not ... i would love to see the cut out stuff -
i heard
that gus v. sand had to take out lot of scene
because of the first-time viewer
( or the producer ? ? ? )
well still it is an artistic movie .
much too short though ... it is one of my all time favorites - and i am aware of it
that the majority of person can not stand that kind of movie
and assume that person
who enjoy
that film are whatever
they think
... ... .what a pity .
hopefully there will come the day
that there will be a dvd with the full material -
hoping to see more of crispian ,
keanu - expecting to see her baby
and allif you have the chance
to see it ,
think twice ,
and enjoy it
if you made the choice to watch ... m
