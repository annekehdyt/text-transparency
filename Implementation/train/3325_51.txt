i am a big fan of stephen king .
i loved the running man .
so obviously i was very excited
that someone had made a film of it .
and when a local network showed the film ,
i was in heaven .
i was all ready for a night of fun !
the first indicator
that something was wrong
was when i noticed
that someone had cast arnold schwarzenegger .
i could simply not believe
that a man
who got famous for film filled with runnin ' an ' shootin '
could play a more cunning part ,
as was described in the book .
i still was convinced
that this would be a good film 
however .
who knows ,
maybe arnold had some hidden talent ? well ,
he did not .
i soon found out
that the only reason
he was even cast
was because someone had re-written the entire story
to make it about fightin ' an ' shootin ' .
yup 
it was a standard arnold-film :
hero is done wrong 
hero solf problem by flexing his mighty muscle
and scaring everyone away
and hero gets the girl.i was stunned .
this is not what the book said at all .
i know
that book can not be put on screen literally ,
but this did not even have ty to the book .
stephen king should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film
and he should have forbidden using the title the running man for this shameless waste of film .
i do not say it often ,
but this film was bad .
if i were not at home watching ,
i would have tossed rotten tomato at the screen .
once again : bad .
( note
that i used 'someone ' a lot .
i did this
because i am
sure a lot of person are ashamed to have worked on this
and i do not want to embarrass them even further
by naming them here )
