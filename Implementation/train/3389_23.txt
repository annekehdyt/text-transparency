what more can i say ?
the acting was ,
almost without exception 
amateurish .
the directing and continuity were pitiful .
the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious .
one of the feature on the dvd was labeled `` gag reel ''
but that could have been a description of a viewer 's reaction to most of the movie.one of the most amusing thing
was in the director 's comment on the dvd .
he said ,
with a straight face ,
that he had set out
to make a movie with high production value and a name cast -
and that he had succeeded .
with delusion like
that it is easy to understand
how the movie turned out
as it did.perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster .
the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit
( per the 'making of ' feature on the dvd )
and rather looked it .
the mask and claw were little better than off the shelf job from any costume store .
the cgi effect were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game .
