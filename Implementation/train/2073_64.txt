from the filmmaker
who ought us the march of the penguin ,
i guess
that came with plenty of expectation for the fox and the child .
from the harsh winter of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france 
the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale ,
which tells of the friendship between the two titular character ,
renard the fox and its friendship with the child
who christened it ,
played by bertille noel-beuneau.the story 's frankly quite simple ,
and at time this movie would have looked like the many japanese movie
which child-miscellaneous animal striking a friendship after the development of trust ,
and how they go about hanging around each other 
dealing with respective adversary and the like .
here 
the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountain ,
which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shot
that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture.but
while we indulge in wistful scenery ,
the character do not get to establish that level of trust from the onset ,
and we have to wait a few season to past 
and 45 minute into the film ,
before they find a leveler in food .
the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective
of taming the creature for her own amusement 
but the fox 
well 
as other notion of course .
while i thought
the narrative was pretty weak 
unlike march of the penguin
which has that human narrative interpretation of what is happening on screen ,
what excelled here were the documentary element of the movie 
tracing the life and time of the fox as both a predator 
and a prey.between the two 
more tension and drama was given to the latter ,
especially when dealing with traditional fo like wolf ,
and granted 
those sequence were fairly intense especially
when the child got emoiled in it .
otherwise 
it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their
playing with each other ,
in shot
that
you know
have undergone some movie magic editing .
there were surprisingly dark moment in the movie
that were not really quite suitable for child ,
as those in the same hall attested
to it by bawling their eye out suddenly ,
so parent 
you might want to take note
and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers.as a film ,
i would 've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguin ,
but i guess the way
it was resented ,
probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature ,
and that some thing are just not meant to be ,
and should stay as such .
decent movie
that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel- bruneau 
and the multiple fox
that played renard .
