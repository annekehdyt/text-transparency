when will the hurting stop ?
i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again .
they keep on making movie with the same story ,
falling over each other
in trying to make the movie better then the rest ,
but sadly fail to do so ,
as this is not a good story .
moralistic 
old-fashioned 
conservative happy-thinking .
as if person learn .
the numerous different version of this film prove
that we don\u00b4t .
