ok 
let me say
that i did not expect a film starring jerry springer
to be cinematic gold ,
all i asked for was it to be cinematic ...
and it was not even that .
it looked like someone 's bad home movie .
poorly acted 
scripted ,
and filled to the im with nudity of the most unnattractive person i have ever seen.the film 's `` plot '' focuse on a low-class family
who decide to go on the `` jerry farrelly show ''
to discuss multiple affair between a mother 
daughter 
stepfather and the daughter 's fiancee .
from there 
the movie fizzle and develops into a unique experience :
white-trash pornography .
there is redneck sex 
interacial sex 
even sex between jerry and his wife ?
( yuk ! )
this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater
and get a second circumcision .
at least it was mercifully short .
disgusting and degrading .
african-american and working class america should be offended .
( howard stern should be pleased however ,
he did not squander his attempt for film stardom .
his was smart 
funny and entertaining ) my grade :
f+
( the daughter was hot )
