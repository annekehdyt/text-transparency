tasteless .
i can not even write intelligently about the movie .
i laughed the entire movie .
it was not supposed to be funny .
matt farnsworth has no clue
what he is doing .
his story is written ,
it seems ,
without any knowledge of iowa culture and the meth problem .
i know
farnsworth is from iowa ,
which makes his movie even more puzzling to me .
why do the two main character have accent ?
it does not make any sense .
the acting was mediocre at best and at time hard to watch .
gratituous violence and sex filled the movie .
i am guessing
that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy ,
but it came across as unbelievable and offensive .
the ending of the movie is so illiantly bad
that all i could do was laugh
and look at the rolling credit with disbelief .
as i walked out of the theatre
everyone else
who was leaving
was laughing along with me .
the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tear ,
but it did the exact opposite .
do not waste your time on this horrible movie ,
unless you want to see ignorant 
sappy 
overacted 
clich\u00e9d drivel .
