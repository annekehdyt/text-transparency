stunning .
absolutely stunning .
this is a movie about two kid
who 's father suddenly has a vision .
he claim an angel visit him ,
and tells him
that they need to kill `` demon '' .
he gets instruction later ,
and they start rounding up the demon ,
which are ,
to the naked eye 
ordinary person .
they kill these so-called demon with an ax to the head ,
and chop them up 
burying them in the rose-garden .
their father claim
he can see their sin
when he touches them .
the movie continues 
with a twist at the end.the thing
that i love about this movie ,
is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception .
is their father completely mad ?
or 
is he telling the truth ?
the audience is left to decide .
go make the judgment for yourself ,
and see the movie .
now .
