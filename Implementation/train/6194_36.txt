`` grey matter '' aka `` the brain machine ''
but the video person thought better of that ;
the screen says
1972 but imdb says 1977 ;
it is that kind of movie .
the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'ain machine ' project
that has drafted four person -
who turn out to be 
roughly 
a philosopher 
a horny priest 
a crackpot veteran and a patriot
who got an abortion -
to sit in a shrinking room with a computer
that can read their horrendous secret thought .
in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dy .
here is a movie
that is incompetent in every important way ;
my s*** has better production value than this .
it held my interest 
though 
just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmaker thought
they were doing 
dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama .
the answer :
a tract about how science is inferior to god .
thank a lot .
it is like opening a kinder egg
and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle .
the priest is played by jame `` roscoe p. coltrane '' best 
the philosopher by gerald `` the republican simon '' mcraney .
also featuring very 
very 
very long
establishing and transition shot in great quantity ,
this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention .
