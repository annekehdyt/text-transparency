as with most of ben affleck 's movie ,
the comedy is dry
and story is predictable .
that is if you want to call this a story .
many point were left connected with no thought at all .
i want to thank the director
for not explaining the point better .
i say
that because 
that would mean the torture would have lasted longer .
as for any of ben affleck 's failure 
this one is no exception
and is survivable only by the other actor .
even then 
the acting for the most part was contrived
and was not believable .
the trip down memory lane with actor i have not seen in year was not worth the price of admission .
all thought
it should be told ,
they too are quickly joining the rank of the `` has-been '' .
my choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie .
i made the wrong decision .
all in all i would give it a one laugh ...
mainly because that is all i got out of it .
