if you have not already seen this movie of mary-kate and ashley 's ,
then all i can say is :
`` what are you waiting for ! ? `` .
this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twin
that we all know
and love so much !
it is fun 
romantic 
exciting and absolutely eath-taking
( scenery-wise ) !
of course ; as always 
mary-kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway !
would any true fan want it any other way ?
of course not !
anyway ; it is a great movie in every sense of the word ,
so if you have not already seen
it then you just have to now !
i mean right now too !
so what are you waiting for ?
i promise
that you will not be disappointed !
sincerely 
rick morris
