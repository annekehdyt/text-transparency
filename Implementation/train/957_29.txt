this is one of those film
that i remember being in the can for year
before anything happening w/it .
i do not think it is terrible ,
but it is not really good either .
alec baldwin was pretty good ,
but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best .
the cast is pretty good in what they are given ,
but again you are only as good as the script .
baldwin
directing this although i could have sworn
he did not direct all of it ,
i thought
i read somewhere or lot of re-shoot was not bad
but he definitely has some potential in there .
although his work on `` 30 rock '' is nothing short of genius
and should keep him busy for a little while longer .
i just hope the show bows out gracefully a la seinfeld ,
but maybe not even that long .
9 year it went .
so if you want to see a film
that you will not get much from ,
but will not really hate either well this is for you .
i can not remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long
before finally being released
and only on dvd at that .
it was nice to see alec baldwin and anthony hopkin again together
since their excellent yet not much person have seen `` the edge . ''
now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment .
