les convoyeur attendent was the first film i
saw in 2000 and i doubt
i will see a better one this year .
this beautiful tragicomedy by belgian filmmaker beno\u00eet mariage is set in the industrial wasteland of wallonia .
beno\u00eet poelvoorde plays a father
who desperately wants his son to win a car
( a lada ! )
for him .
to do this the son has to eak the record opening door .
what the father actually wants his for his son to be someone ,
because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically
called l'espoir
( hope ) .
of course nothing works out as planned .
this film can best be compared to aki kaurism\u00e4ki 's drifting clouds ,
although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker .
just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat ,
without being unrealistically happy .
the humour is absurd ,
without making the plot unbelievable ,
and mariage find stunning image in the bleak
setting
that never seem artificial .
the best thing about les convoyeur attendent is the acting by poelvoorde .
this actor shot to fame with the also illiant cult-classic c'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous
in which he played the charismatic hitman ben .
since then he only played two small role in film
that were not released in the netherland 
because ,
as he said in an interview ,
he was not convinced of his own acting capability and all the role
he was offered
were reprise of the ben character .
with his return to a leading role in lca there should be no doubt anymore about his acting .
he is simply illiant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery ,
but smart enough to realize what he is done
and be torn by remorse about it .
a must see .
