with one of my very favorite actor 
jame spader 
i expected this film to be at least tolerable .
it was not .
after the first half hour i watched the rest
of it with the remote control in my hand
so the fast forward was at the ready .
so trite 
so standard 
one knows
what is going to happen in each scene .
one can even predict the dialogue word for word .
this is one of those movie
that makes one scratch one head
and say ,
`` how did this movie ever get made ? ''
in an effort
to say something positive ,
i will add
that there are some mildly entertaining special effect .
but 
on the whole 
if you have seen 5 sci/fi movie ,
or you are over 9 year old ,
do yourself a favor and skip this one .
