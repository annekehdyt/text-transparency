stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sort from the 1994 movie `` stargate . ''
i am so glad
that they decided to expand on the subject .
the show gets it rolling from the very first episode ,
a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion 
dr. daniel jackson .
through the first two episode ,
we meet samantha carter 
a very intelligent individual
who lets no one walk over her ,
and there is teal'c 
a quiet 
compassionate warrior
who defies his false god
and joins the team .
the main bad guy are called the gouald ,
they are parasite
who can get inserted into one 's ain ,
thus controlling them and doing evil deed .
any gouald
who has a massive amount of power
is often deemed as a `` system lord . ''
the warrior behind the gouald are called jaffa ,
who house the parasitic gouald in their body
until the gouald can get inserted in a person 's ain.through the episode ,
we mostly get to see sg-1 
the exploratory team comprised of jack/daniel/teal'c/and sam 
go through the wormhole
that instantly transports them to other planet
( this device is called the stargate )
and they encounter new culture or bad guy .
some episode are on-world ,
meaning
that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issue on earth.through the year ,
you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit 
and more character-building story line .
this 
in turn mean even more on-world episode ,
which is perfectly understandable.my rating :
8.75/10
-- --
while most of this show is good ,
there are some instance of story line
not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few year .
but still 
top notch science fiction !
