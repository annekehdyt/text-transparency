ok 
first of all 
steve irwin 
rest in peace .
you were loved by many fan .
now ... this movie was not a movie at all .
it was `` the crocodile hunter '' tv program with bad acting 
bad script ,
and bad
directing in between steve capturing
or teaching us about animal .
he was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist .
million will miss him .
but the whole movie idea was a big mistake .
the plot was so oken ,
it was almost non-existent .
casting was horrible .
the acting was not even worth elementary school-level actor .
the direction must be faulted as well .
if you can not get a half-way decent performance out of your actor ,
no matter
how bad the script is ,
you must not be that good in the first place .
i could have written a better script .
i wish i had never been to see this movie .
of course 
i watched it for $ 3
( $ 1.50 for me 
$ 1.50 for my son . )
while out with friend
who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action .
my son ,
who is not so discriminating 
liked the movie alright ,
but he still has never asked to see it again .
if you want fond memory of steve irwin ,
buy his series on dvd .
avoid this movie like the plague .
if i were steve ,
i know
i would not want to be remembered for this movie .
respect him :
avoid this movie !
