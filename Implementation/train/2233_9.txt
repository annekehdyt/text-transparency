amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel `` the celestine prophecy '' ,
which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru .
home video quality actor present so-called character spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum ,
while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of armand mastroianni .
even though there are visible attempt
at measuring up to and interesting fan of stronger fare in the vain of abc 's `` lost '' or dan brown 's `` the da vinci code '' ,
the filmmaker are hardly up to the task .
this film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda ,
and the result are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point .
