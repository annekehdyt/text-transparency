deathstalker is perfect for b-fantasy movie fan ;
this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making feature everything heckler can ask for
-- non-existent plotting 
terrible acting
( save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady ) ,
laughable scripting and schlock editing 
and bargain-basement style background setting .
there are no character
that come across as likable or interesting
( in particular 
the lead does not have anything appealing about him ) ,
and the actor assembled barely do anything to rise above the f-grade material .
if that is not enough ,
then how about the lack of a compelling plot
( which this movie has nothing of the sort )
to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey ?
i was also offended
that the woman in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 )
be topless and/or scan notily clad ; 2 )
get raped ;
3 ) have sex with the hero ; 4 )
all of the above .
in addition 
the background music is hideous ;
a bizarre mess of electronic noise 
cheesy choral burst 
and blaring orchestral cacophony .
ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing
to keep one interested ,
deathstalker is probably best suited for folk
looking for something to laugh at
(
and believe me ,
there is plenty of that in here ) .
otherwise 
i do not recommend this 100th-grade conan wanna-be to anyone in the least .
