adrian has just gone out of the asylum ,
being rich and with no parent ,
his life seems empty .
one day 
he meets gonzalo 
a poor boy
whom mother
is prostitute .
desperate for earning some money ,
gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life
and who where his parent .
this is a movie from a new director ,
and it is perfectly clear in most of the film :
scene not correctly directed 
dialogues a little forced 
some incoherence in the script ... anyway ,
the ending is unexpectedly well done
( well 
just a little )
and that saves a little the film .
actor are known and with great quality 
nevertheless ,
they are not inspired enough
to make the movie interesting ;
all of them have done better paper in other film .
the film result boring and probably you will spend most of the time
thinking
how much time will pass until it ends .
of course there are lot of worse film ,
but 
sure 
there are many many better one .
