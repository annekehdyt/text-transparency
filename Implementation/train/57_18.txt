a surprisingly good movie !
it has quite a few good joke thru out the whole movie .
the only negative thing is that some scene go to the extreme
to show
just
how stupid the two main character are .
we get it ,
stupid blonde 
get on with it !
the plot just barely dodges
being called `` corny '' .
and booby are always a plus altho
the movie for some strange
reason does not play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired woman
who act as the evil counter part of our two blonde.so all in all 
a good movie to watch .
i almost gave it an 8/10 ,
but let 's not get crazy .
