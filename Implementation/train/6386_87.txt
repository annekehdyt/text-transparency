haha !
you have to just smile and smile
if you actually made it all the way through this movie .
it like says something about myself i guess .
the movie itself was created i
think as some sort of psychological test 
or like some sort of drug ,
to take you to a place
you have never been before .
when wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus
( sp ? )
he said
it was meaningless and useless ,
but if you read it ,
after you were done ,
it would take you to a new level 
like a ladder ,
and then you could throw away the work and see thing with clarity and true understanding .
this movie is the same i think.as a movie
it is without a doubt ,
the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way .
first of all 
this is snipe .
i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movie .
and i have suffered through a few weak one .
however ,
although you know the movie might suck ,
you would never suspect
that it could be as bad
as it actually was .
which is the fun of it .
i mean this is snipe .
you know
it might be good ,
but it will be alright 
right ?
smile.so this thing on every level is pure boredom 
pure unoriginality .
the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious ,
yet so poorly done
as to be comical .
there is not one character in this movie
that is interesting 
in the least .
and to make the whole thing more surreal ,
they have a soundtrack
that sort of sound like part to various bourne identity type movie ,
only is not quite right .
in fact ,
although it seems close to action movie background music ,
it just so happens
it is done in a manner
that will grate on you fantastically.then all the scene in the total pitch black ,
where honetly since the character are so flat ,
you do not really care what going to happen ,
but regardless ,
after it happens
and someone is killed ,
you just say to yourself ,
was i supposed to see that ?
what else ?
how about scene with blinding ,
obnoxious flashing at a strobe light pace 
for a period of time
that is too long to bear .
sure let 's throw that in .
how bout this though .
when you are straining
and your eye can not handle it any longer ,
do some more of these in the dark kills where
you really do not see what happened .
and on top of that 
lets face
it you do not care .
you were past bored way from the beginning.so i drifted in and out a couple time ,
but i caught almost all of this movie .
and it becomes something you can watch ,
without something
that engages your mind on any level 
therefore 
it becomes something
you can effectively zone out with ,
and begin to think about your life ,
where its going ,
where its been ,
what we are as people.and that ...
that is the true magic of this film .
