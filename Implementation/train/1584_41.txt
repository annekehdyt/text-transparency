greeting again from the darkness .
18 director of 18 seemingly unrelated vignette about love in the city of light .
a very unusual format
that takes a couple of segment to adjust to as a viewer .
we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie ,
it is a bit disarming
for that to occur in an 8 minute segment.the idea is 18 love/relationship story in 18 different neighborhood of this magnificent city .
of course 
some stand up better than other and some go for comedy ,
while other focus on dramatic emotion .
some very known director are involved ,
including :
the coen brother 
wes craven 
alfonso cuaron 
alexander payne 
gus van sant and gurinda chadha .
many familiar faces make appearance as well :
steve buscemi 
barbet schroeder 
catalina sandino moreno 
ben gazzara 
gena rowland 
gerard depardieu 
juliette binoche 
willem dafoe 
nick nolte 
maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins.one of the best segment involves a mime ,
and then another mime and the nerdy 
yet happy young son of the two mime .
also playing key role are a red trench coat 
cancer 
divorce 
sexual fantasy 
the death of a child and many other topic .
do not miss alexander payne
( director of `` sideway '' )
as oscar wilde.the diversity of the segment make this interesting to watch ,
but as a film ,
it can not be termed great .
still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer .
