this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union 's first known serial killer .
i had tuned in ,
just expecting a half-decent tv movie ,
but found myself drawn by the compelling way
the story was told .
as other have said ,
there is much to admire here
that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases.much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo ,
whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in ,
until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved .
the acting by the whole cast is also superb 
especially that of the two lead 
stephen rea and donald sutherland .
their convincing portrayal give their character arcs a great deal of credibility ,
and the scene
where they have their first committee meeting
after perestroika is genuinely touching.if
you prefer your crime film with a bit more depth and a little less sheen ,
i strongly recommend you look out for 'citizen x ' .
