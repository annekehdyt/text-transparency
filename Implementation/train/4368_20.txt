the fine cast can not uplift this routine tale of a secretary
murdered by her married paramour .
in fact there are more question than answer in this one-sided tale of romance and murder ;
and since we are only provided with the prosecution 's side ,
none of these question will be answered .
this is the type of fare
that appeal to the `` he woman 
man hater '' club of america .
as presented 
it is the tale of an innocent woman
who just happens to be `` caught up '' in a romance with a married 
high-profile attorney .
is it possible that if 
she had not been two timing her boy friend
and having an affair with a married man ,
the whole nasty murderous 
sordid incident could have been avoided ?
when you watch this ,
do not worry about going to the 'fridge ,
you will not miss anything .
