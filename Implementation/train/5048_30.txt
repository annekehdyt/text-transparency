it a bit peculiar
that a story
that is placed in a part of oslo
where a very high percentage of the local resident is from an asian background
does not even show one asian or african person 
not even as an extra .
that fact probably describes norwegian race relation in general .
- however.no spoiler - only a brief introductory description :
buddy portrays four young person
living in a flat-share in oslo .
the protagonist are two young man
that do not manage to direct their life in any serious fashion ,
and one might say
that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up .
the narrative play on typical teenage dream and fantasy and lifestyle role model .
quite the clich\u00e9 .
although the story is mildly funny ,
the acting is good
and as a 'young person ' one can sort of identify with the character `crazy ' situation and complicated love affair ,
i do not find the story or the character very believable .
to polished and lacking in depth .
this film uses all the classic audience pleasing trick
to make an entertaining film
that has as much intellectual depth as `friend '
( yes
that show on tv )
.has norwegian film finally found its identity ?
:
audience pleaser in well known american style.how about watching lukas moodysson 's tillsamman
( together ) .
