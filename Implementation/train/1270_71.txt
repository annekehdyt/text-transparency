time for a rant 
eh :
i thought
spirit was a great movie to watch .
however 
there were a few thing
that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7
( i am being a little bit generous with the 7 )
.point # 1 :
matt damon aggravates me .
i was thinking 
'what a dicky voice
they got for the main character 
'
when i first heard him narrate -
and then i realized
it is matt damon .
the man bugs me
so very bad - his performance in `` the departed '' was terrible and ruined the movie for me
( before the movie got a chance
to ruin itself ,
but that is another story for some other time ) ,
as it almost did `` spirit '' .
i was able to get past this fact
because of how little narration there actually was ... thankfully.point # 2 :
brian adams suck ...
the whole score was terrible ...
the song were unoriginal 
generic 
and poorly executed ;
not once did i find the music to fit ;
and the lyric were terrible .
every time one of the lame song came on ,
i was turned off .
i almost thought i would start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-american freedom style lyric
( i could not help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic song
that played on the radio constantly after 9/11 ) .
in light of the native american aspect of the film 
they should have gone with fitting music using right instrument 
not petty radio-hit 
teen-bop 
14-year-old-girl crap .
i thought
i was back in junior high school .
i can not believe no better could have been done
-- i refuse to .
had it not have been for this ,
i would rank the film up more with disney ,
which knows a thing or two about originality
( ok ,
do not bother saying
what i know some of you are probably thinking ; ) .
too bad 
it is a shame
they could not have hired better musicians.i liked the art and animation 
except for some thing here
and there ... like sometime the angle appear too sharp on the face and the line too thick or dark on the body
( thick/dark line mainly near the end ) .
there were often time
when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expression and failed
at drawing any real emotion .
but there were also time
when the emotion ran thick .
anyhow 
many scene were lazy
and the layer were apparent.ok ,
i am falling asleep here
so i will sum it up before i start making less sense ... nice try on an epic film ...
it turned out mediocre though .
matt damon 
you suck !
