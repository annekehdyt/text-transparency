i should have figured
that any movie with the poltergeist lady in it is not going to be good .
it actually starts out okay ,
but during the first murder scene you find out
that the movie you are watching
is a movie inside of a movie .
there is person sitting in a movie theatre
watching that movie .
one girl in the audience is so annoying
that i would have turned around and strangled her .
a bit strange 
but far from good .
