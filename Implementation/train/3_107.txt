was this based on a comic-book ?
a video-game ?
a drawing by a 3 year-old ?
there is nothing in this movie
to be taken seriously at all ;
not the character 
not the dialog 
not the plot 
not the action .
nothing .
we have high-tech international terrorists/criminal
who bicker like pre-school kid 
stallone 's man-of-steel-type resilience toward ice-cold weather 
dialog so dumb
that it is sometimes almost hilarious ,
and so on .
even the codename
that the bad guy use
is dumb
( `` tango-tango '' ) .
a film
that entertains through some suspense 
good action-sequence 
and a nice snowy mountainous setting .
oh 
yes :
and the unintentional humour.the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy character
who are obviously having a `` swell '' time .
then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part ,
which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problem
want to pull their hair out .
and then we have some more bad dialog ,
and after that some more great action .
this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell .
stallone 's melodramatic exchange with turner ,
when they meet after a long time ,
is so soapy 
so clich\u00e9d 
so fake ,
and so bad
that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer .
soon after this display of awful dialog-writing 
we are witness to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane .
the entire action is one big absurdity ,
but it is mindless fun at its best .
although the rest of the action is exciting
and fun ,
the airplane scene are truly the highlight of the film .
after the landing 
our master-criminal seek for a guide
and end up with stallone and rooker .
they send stallone to fetch the first case of money ,
but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it ;
they take most of his clothe off
( so he can freeze )
and they will not give him the equipment he needs
( so he can fall off ) .
do these gangster want their money fetched or not ? ? ?
very silly .
apparently they do not trust stallone ,
but surely they know
that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage .
nevertheless 
our gangster make stallone 's climb difficult ,
if for no logical reason then to at least show us
how truly evil
they are - lest there be any doubt .
and for those
who might still doubt
how evil the bad guy are ,
they overact 
ag 
and snicker in a truly evil manner .
everyone convinced ?
good .
you would better be .
otherwise the writer will throw in a mass execution of twenty school child ,
just to make sure
that the evilness of the bad guy is crystal-clear to everyone.the old guy
who flies the chopper ...
how the hell did he fall for the trap ?
firstly 
he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminal ,
and secondly ,
he must have heard stallone 's and rooker 's voice on the walkie-talky .
a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchange take place ,
with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly line .
`` get off my back ! ''
lithgow :
`` i have not even started climbing on your back . ''
or 
lithgow to stallone :
`` we had a deal ,
but now we only have each other ! ''
and as for lithgow 's gang of murderer :
these guy never seem to want to kill immediately .
they are very creative about it ;
they philosophize 
pretend
that they are playing football with your body ,
and so on .
stallone co-wrote this thing .
i have no idea what drug he was on
when he did it .
i would hate to think
the script is this bad
because of a low i.q .
