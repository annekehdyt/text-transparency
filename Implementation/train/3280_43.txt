`` john hughe ' son wrote a high school drama !
wow ! ''
i thought
as i checked the flick 's info here on imdb 
late on a saturday night ,
having found myself
watching the opening credit on bbc2.i have just finished watching it ,
and sadly it was downhill from there on .
arguably you can not spoil a film this poor ,
but i will leave the spoiler out of this review ...
there is an awful lot of style over very little substance :
unfortunately the style has not dated too well in the eight year since its release .
as for the substance 
the film try to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life ;
but beneath the shiny veneer 
a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise .
character are painted in childishly oad stroke ,
falling into the kind of generic stereotype
the writer 's father sought to question in breakfast club .
director kyle cooper does a decent job
keeping the pace up
( perhaps relying a little too much on montage of information ,
which soon becomes a tiresome device ,
but at least push the story along ) ,
but his effort do not sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting
( how anyone is supposed to side with 'maddox ' ,
when blake shield gurn and glower his way through the part 
i just can not understand ) ,
not to mention the numerous gaping plot hole
( i am all for creative license ,
but when the `` bad guy '' know the identity of the `` good guy ''
making their life a misery ,
but fail to act in any way
to stop them ,
you really have to wonder
why this script did not undergo another few re-draft
before production - did daddy even read it ?
) .i am sure
a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film
( and all power to them ) ,
but they are really better off sticking with hughe sr. 's high school output ,
and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeal ,
the 1968 classic `` if ... '' is a much more satisfying examination of the subject .
