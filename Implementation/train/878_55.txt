salvage :
4/10 .
groundhog day meets a christian coalition horror film .
okay maybe it is not that bad .
but it is close.claire
( played by alicia silverstonesque lauren currie lewis )
is stalked
and possibly killed by a serial killer
( chris ferry
who is quite menacing and utal ) .
i say
possibly
because she wake up
and it was all a dream ..
or was it ?
( cue music )
the basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minute of plot
( done quite well the first time )
is repeated over and over again .
and since claire wake up every time
and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality i
just stopped caring what happened to claire
and started wondering
what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.i was rooting for a s\u00e9ance
( which honestly would have made more sense )
but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise ending
( think
the village or below )
yup the film collapses faster than donnie darko 's director cut .
all the great twist
ending in horror movie
the sixth sense 
the original invasion of the body snatcher 
happy birthday to me worked
because the audience was not expecting a left field explanation .
( heck even the canoe ending in the original friday
the 13th was worth a jolt )
salvage on the other hand scream twist
ending with every scene change .
other nagging fault is the one note piano soundtrack
( though the featured song were decent )
the obvious time padding
( claire doing the dish 
claire 's mother 's subplot ) ,
the way claire says
`` hello is anyone there '' every time
she thinks
there is a serial killer around.also some of the secondary acting role
( in particular claire 's mother
played by maureen olander
who resembles a mary kay zombie )
shows the first time actor low budget roots.both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough salvage
keeps your interest
if only to see how they are going to fix this mess .
problem is they really do not .
