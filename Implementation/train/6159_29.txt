*spoiler warning*first of all i rated this movie 2/10.the idea is good ,
but there are too many stupid error in the movie ,
failing to make it the psyching drama
that it might have been .
first of all she never fights alone .
after an initial very strange doubt from her mother
( which is not believable
when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie )
the rape victim is not alone .
she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew 's strange trap .
her friend are unbelievably nasty.the thing
that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew
when he change his opinon .
ethan is very much the leader of the crew
( hey ,
they even say so )
and person seem to think
the other guy is a jerk ,
but when ethan change his opinion he just does not manage to convince even one single person in the crew
that he is right
and that his former friend is wrong .
everyone just simply hates him ...
why ? ?
the movie provides no explanation .
how did he ever become the leader ?
a funny note is that my girlfriend thought
i was watching beverly hill
when she came in .
two actor from the same successful tv-series ... . a cheap way to get viewer ?
