this movie is so complex
that it can be given any description
and still roll with it .
you have a insecure 
troubled and fascinating main character
( played by jean-pierre l\u00e9aud )
who is trapped between two
( no 
three ) woman .
we listen to his social 
philosophical and moral idiosyncrasy in interminable monologue ,
we see him working his magic around the three woman
that he loves .
this could be the premise for a fowl movie 
full of rigid 
cold 
uninteresting commentary .
yet director jean eustache manage to keep it fresh 
ironic and witty .
being such a long movie ,
one can not but burst into laughing when 
after 2 hour of speaking politely 
jean-pierre l\u00e9aud all of a sudden screams on the phone
while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie .
this kind of situation are purely cinematographic
and can not be fully restored in a commentary .
nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of fran\u00e7oise leun towards the end of the movie .
3 and 1/2 hour and worthing every minute .
