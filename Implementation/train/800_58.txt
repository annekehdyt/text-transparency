i have read a number of review on this film
and i have to say
`` what is wrong with you person ? ! ? ! ''
this was an excellent film !
i thought
this film was superb from start to finish
and the story was extremely well told .
i am convinced
that the person
that did not like this film
were not paying very good attention to the film .
there are a number of very important scene
that
if you are not paying attention
you will be confused
and the following scene may not make sense .
i urge anyone
who did not like this film to watch it again
and watch it alone so
that you can truly pay attention .
the story made perfect sense to me
and as i said ,
was very well told .
every scene in the film has a point
and everything fit together at the end
of the film.all the actor did a fantastic job !
sean connery was very good in his role as always .
laurence fishburne was superb as tanny brown ,
playing a very interesting character .
kate capshaw was a nice touch as well ,
and looks fantastic .
blair underwood was a pleasant surprise ,
i did not really expect anything great from him ,
but he pulled off a great performance .
ed harris was the real gem in the film .
he plays a truly sick individual
and really makes you see
how disturbed his character is .
watch his eye in his scene 
just superb ! ! !
also 
there is a very young scarlett johansson
( as kate )
in one of her first role ... not a bad place
to start .
excellent cast in this film ! i would strongly recommend this film to anyone
that likes any of the cast member or just likes thriller .
this is a great film
and should be seen .
do not listen all these other person 's opinion ,
go see the movie
and come to your own conclusion .
i hope
that you will see the film ,
and i hope
that you enjoy it as much as i do .
thank for reading
