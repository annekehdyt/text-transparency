roy roger and company try to ing `` sintown '' back to life -
it is a ghost town
which may go boom
if silver mining is successful .
andy devine
( as `` cookie '' )
slapsticks around .
jane frazee
( as carol )
loses a piece of her bitch to mr. roger ' sharp leer .
foy willing and the rider of the purple sage stand-in
( or 
is that sing-in ? )
for the a.w.o.l .
bob nolan and the son of the pioneer .
jame finlayson
( from the laurel and hardy film )
adds to the `` slapstick '' look of `` grand canyon trail '' .
a loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance .
mr. devine 's mule kicks its heel .
there are energetic human performance 
too - but ,
the material is not grand .
