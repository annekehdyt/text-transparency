after mob boss vic morettus
( late great anthony franciosa )
kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek 
their new chauffeur/ vietnam vet ,
and blames it on the poor guy ,
derek finds himself in jail
where he has to contend with a corrupt warden 
vic 's prisoner other
who runs the jail ,
and 
oh yeah illegal experiment
conducted by a shady cia agent
( great genre-mainstay and first time director john saxon )
to turn various prisoner into super-human invincible zombie .
of course thing get out of hand
and it is up to derek ,
and the rest of the unchanged prisoner ,
to save the day
after the infected one take
the jail over.john saxon is a great talented actor
and as a director saxon is a ... great talented actor .
to say this movie
( john 's sole directorial outing to date )
lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement .
however 
the film is not totally without merit .
the dialog 
while idiotic 
is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes .
sadly 
this is not really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone
and it takes forever for the film to even start coming
into it is own
( which is fairly late in the movie ) .
as such 
the most i can recommend this film is to say
that if you are a fan of saxon
( which i indeed am ) ,
it is worth one watch ,
just go in with low expectation
and you should be fine.eye candy :
