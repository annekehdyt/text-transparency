the film is a collection of cliche is on just about anything out there .
it has no focus whatsoever 
no goal 
no real message .
symbolism is pushed over the top
and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous .
this movie can not resist the temptation
of making drama
where non exist .
every small exchange of word turn immediately into a lengthy 
unjustified dialog
that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal .
where there is no substance to this exchange ,
the actor
( regardless of how good they are normally )
can not help but compensate with exaggerated emotion ,
aka `` raising the stake '' .
over acting 
to put it simply .
the directing is of no help here .
nothing can save this non-story .
it is forced 
faked and boring to tear .
inaccuracy in portaraying punk rock with the who 
piercing and flashy 90 's outfit .
character wander
without a role 
detail and motive .
location are arbitrary .
this is boogie night cum the good fella cum saturday night fever ,
with meaning and art ripped out.good dp .
i will give it that.some film have flaw .
this film is lee 's flaw .
he sold out 
like the rest of them .
became irrelevant .
he has nothing of interest
to say
anymore.i have no desire to see anything again from this guy
( whom i will refrain from naming from now on ) .
