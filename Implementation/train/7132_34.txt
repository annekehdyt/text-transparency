... that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version.despite all of the other comment
written here ,
i really prefer the bette davis version ,
even though the novak version has a more coherent story line.however :
davis ' mildred 's raw emotion seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl
who seems easily to become a prostitute.and
it is those raw emotion
that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with .
he has emotion of despair 
of failure 
of `` otherness '' - strong emotion
that he represses .
davis ' mildred 
on the other hand 
displays her emotion immediately and without censure .
she has no feeling of despair 
or of failure 
or of `` otherness '' ;
rather 
she is merely surviving
as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era.novak 's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred
than was davis ' 
almost through the the whole movie .
davis ' mildred was **never** vulnerable
until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance .
and when he reviles her - for her method
of keeping body and soul together ,
and for continually taking advantage of his love for her -
she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever
seen on screen :
`` i wiped my mouth !
i wiped my mouth ! ! ''
novak 's vulnerability was excellent .
davis ' realism was monumental.imdb vote concur !
