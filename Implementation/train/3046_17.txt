stephen king was raised on flick like this .
-flick not films.movie like this and 'jeeper creeper ' are `` throwback '' to the good 'ol day drive-in horror flick .
they are meant to be fun 
cheaply made and hopefully :
a few good scares.anyone
looking for a theory on the human condition
should pass on this creature feature
because that is all this is ... all
it ever will be.stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash .
-good 
fun 
trash !
if you enjoyed this i recommend :
'jeeper creeper ' 'jeeper creeper 2 ' '30 day of night ' 'scarecrow '
( '88 )
'they live ' 'planet terror ' 'death proof ' and 'halloween iii :
season of the witch '
