well it was a nice surprise after all .
its trailer did not predict a good film at all ,
it was even a bit misleading .
especially the part of jeff bridge was a positive surprise 
well written 
sardonic and funny .
less real though 
i do not think a guy
who got where
he got
would show sign of such irreverence toward everything
that his current company stands for .
one does not become a top suit
just to doubt
it all suddenly again .
the ending of the film 
during the showing of dolce vita 
was too corny 
clich\u00e9 and quite disappointing .
and of course a guy like pegg 's character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this .
i hope
one day i will see a decent role
written for megan fox ,
here she looked a poor actress
playing a bimbo .
and by the way 
i do not see
why she is the `` sex symbol '' of the year ,
i see hotter girl on nearly every cover of every magazine .
