this is a very bad western mainly
because it is historically inaccurate .
it looks
as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died 
idaho 
colorado territory 
and montana .
it fictionalizes everything
that is known about this mysterious 'bad man 
' 'good man . '
the script is horrible ;
there is very little direction ,
and lousy acting .
dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife .
mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade .
in real life 
jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent .
he was feared by his local townsman for his hard drinking .
when drunk he would start fight and cause other problem in virginia city 
montana .
to insure
that he could never terrorize them again 
vigilante lynched jack slade
after he ignored their warning
to leave town immediately .
this is a horrible movie .
i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butch history at will 
even to this day .
