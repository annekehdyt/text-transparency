***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** well ,
seeing as i am a major h :
lot fan 
maybe i liked the movie more than normal person would .
however 
this movie is still excellent .
it had ton of surprise ,
and it gave some more closure to the series .
while i was sad
that bayliss turned into a murderer ,
the overall feeling i felt was satisfied .
