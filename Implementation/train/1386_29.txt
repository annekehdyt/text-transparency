got into this flick ,
just
as it was beginning ,
on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu -
otherwise i would have missed it .
that probably would have been best.i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas - both very good performer -
and thought
this might be worth a look .
it proved to be to some extent ,
but
only because it is one of those story
so awful
it fascinates.zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talent 
except for her jayne mansfield- or loni anderson-like bosom .
unfortunately 
her acting prowess - at least here - makes mansfield
and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison.the young nut case 's white rat 
the owner 's cat 
the young nut case
having the owner evicted
and restrained in her own home 
and a bunch of doophus 's
( including the young nut case )
running around a bio hazard facility ,
and the absurd conclusion .
i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element
to contain at least a modicum of realism 
believability or being capable of evoking some empathy/sympathy
-- but this proved to be in vain .
