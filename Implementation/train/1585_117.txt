ridiculous fluff 
that compounds its error
by trying to have meaning .
joan 
this time as a congresswoman 
agatha reed 
chairwoman of a committee
dedicated to `` investigating the high cost of food . ''
says congresswoman reed ,
`` the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long .
i am going to keep fighting long enough
so that the american family can take a vacation once a year ,
see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant . ''
she is all business ,
but becomes all gushy
when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college ,
where she was expelled for the crime
of having stayed out all night
( the parallel to joan 's real life is unmistakable here ,
as it is in all joan movie ) .
the degree causes much consternation on campus
( `` that would make it the most oad-minded institution in the history of education ! '' )
\u0096 but joan is unaware of this as she arrives .
the college president 
jim merrill ,
played by robert young 
at his handsomest ,
happens to be joan 's former teacher \u0096 and lover .
it was with *him*
that
she spent the night out ,
all those year ago ,
but joan felt
it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college
that they were about to be married .
naturally 
this high-profile event will be covered by *life* magazine \u0096
and who does the photographer turn out to be ?
yet another of joan 's old lover \u0096 this one ,
she hung out with in china `` during the war '' ,
and he thinks
joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame .
eve arden ,
playing joan 's assistant 
`` woodie 
''
is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie \u0096 with her flippant and unnecessary remark
that would make you dismiss her from her job ,
if you did not like her so much .
but you not only like eve in this ,
as in all her role 
you adore her .
she is so droll and no-nonsense ,
you would like to pay her just to hang around
and be one of the boy .
when joan cry upon arriving at her alma mater ,
eve tell her it `` looks fierce . ''
but joan says
that maybe other only see a collection of building ,
she 
joan ,
sees youth \u0096 herself at 18 `` eager ,
expectant \u0096 a little frightened ,
asking 'what is life ?
what am i ? ' ''
but 
of course ,
if we actually go into depth about joan at 18 ,
the truth may be a little different .
for me 
this is the major problem
in watching any joan movie .
you can call her character whatever you want to ,
but it is always all joan 
all the time .
so ,
since what we are always seeing
is joan being herself ,
it is easy to dispense with character 's name .
it is just that it gets confusing
when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue ,
like her description of herself at 18 \u0096
when we know
that at 18 
joan had already been around the block several time .
many man would have described her as eager ,
and as far as being expectant 
she had already had several abortion at this point .
but that is a personal problem ,
and i digress ,
but i simply wanted to explain
why i say
thing such as `` and then joan does '' this or that 
or `` we see joan as ... ''
when we are not literally watching a home movie.there is an unintentionally hilarious momant
in which joan is given the clara bow doll
that she left behind in college \u0096 quick arithmetic
tell us
that joan and clara were contemporary and this is a transparent ploy
to make us believe
joan is much younger
than she actually looks .
it fails .
what also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness .
in the story 
joan has written a book about free speech
and made a film
( no 
not the one about the plumber ) ,
and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical 
dr. pitt ,
who is about to be fired for his view ,
which are shockingly similar to joan 's .
this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale \u0096a weak one ,
to be sure ,
but perhaps the only thing
that keeps it from sliding into oblivion .
