wow !
pretty terrible stuff .
the richard burton/elizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably ill-conceived tennessee william fiasco .
taylor plays a rich ,
dying widow holding fort over her minion on an island
where she dictates 
very loudly 
her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary .
when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend ,
taylor realizes her time is up .
ludicrious in the extreme
-- -
it is difficult to determine
if taylor and burton are acting badly
or if it was william ' intention
to make their character so unappealing .
if that is the case ,
then the acting is illiant !
burton mumbles his line ,
including the word boom several time ,
while taylor screeches her 's .
she is really awful .
so is noel coward as taylor 's catty confidante 
the `` witch of capri . ''
presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life move along
-- - two standard william theme ,
but it is so misdirected by losey ,
that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologue ,
any substance the film has would have been completely diluted .
boom does have stunning photography
-- -the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia !
the supporting cast feature joanna shimkus 
the great romolo valli as taylor 's resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard ...
both he and his dog do a number on burton !
