i remember being terrified of movie blood
when i was younger ,
and gradually getting less so ,
until getting jaded enough ,
as i am sure
many other viewer have become ,
so that the barrage of gory film
produced in last few year
have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm .
`` the dentist '' turned
that around.the setup seems simple :
a mentally unstable dentist wreak havoc on the inside of mouth 
and perhaps body as well .
a clever twist 
though 
is that
the dentist is the film 's protagonist ,
so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation ,
his development is the most extensive of any character
and he is very human and believable .
the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victim ,
and instead of hoping for justice to come to him ,
i found myself hoping
he would somehow find a way
to cover up his track and return to a normal life.what
really `` makes ''
a horror movie is the violence .
and `` the dentist '' does it better
than any other film i can think of .
first off 
the film has ton of tension ,
which is something
that modern gore film tend to lack .
in one scene
( ) ,
the dentist is emotionally distraught
and has to see a young child patient for the first time .
as he reaches into the child 's mouth ,
you hope
that 
for the dentist 's and the child 's sake 
the encounter ends
without injury .
i will not spoil what happens .
second ,
when the gore does come ,
it hits all the worst 
squirmy nerve .
once again 
i will not give anything away.of course ,
being a movie
that you have never heard of ,
it does have flaw .
most importantly 
it is exclusively for horror fan .
also ,
as another reviewer mentioned ,
by taking place over a span of just a few day ,
we do not really get any background on the character .
and the tension drops a little bit during the very end .
but really 
the fact
that we would even want to know background about the character
is evidence
to how good it is ,
and the bulk of the film is solid enough
that any small lapse in tension can be forgiven.it is strange ,
after year of being accustomed to movie gore ,
to suddenly want to cover my eye at the sight of blood .
`` the dentist '' made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable ,
and for this it earns my full approval .
