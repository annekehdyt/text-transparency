giallo fan 
seek out this rare film .
it is well written ,
and full of all sort of the usual low lifes
that populate these film .
i do not want to give anything away ,
so i wont even say anything about the plot .
the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere ,
and you do not know what to expect or who to suspect .
recommended !
the only place i have seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema 
for $ 15 .
