'they all laughed ' is a superb peter bogdanovich
that is finally getting the recognition it deserves ,
and why ?
their are many reason the fact
that it is set in new york
which truly sets the tone 
the fantastic soundtrack 
the appealing star turn from ben gazzara 
and the late john ritter
who is superb .
and of course no classic is complete
without audrey hepburn .
the film is a light and eezy romantic comedy
that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirty ,
film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency
which is run by gazzara
who with his fellow detective pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak
( the film co-producer )
and john ritter 
basically the gazzara fall for a rich tycoon magnate 's wife
( hepburn )
and ritter fall for beautiful dorothy stratten
who sadly murdered infamously after production ,
'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fan .
