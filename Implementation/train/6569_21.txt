here is a real weirdo for you .
it starts out with another take-off on the psycho shower scene 
on campus ,
then gets crazier
when several coed and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break .
the trouble starts
when they drive into the redneck county
ruled by homicidal sheriff dean .
one of the college cuties wander into the wood ,
witnesses a murder by the sheriff
and has her head blown open .
then it is lets-rip-off macon county line-time as dean stalk 
trap and slaughter the witless witnesses one by one .
tony march is on-target as the evil 
shotgun-happy dean .
the movie 's overall tone is truly disturbing .
the ending is so aupt you almost think
the director ran out of film ;
it is also a study in despair .
shallow grave is a must for misanthrope 
misogynist and nihilists the world over .
