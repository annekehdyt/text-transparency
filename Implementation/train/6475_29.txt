having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn ,
i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead 
of all movie .
have not seen that one yet 
but ,
considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movie ever ,
safe to say i made the wrong choice .
there is simply nothing to recommend this movie ,
and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut .
it did not even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movie like i know
what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend .
it simply made no sense 
held no excitement ,
had very little interesting acting or compelling writing .
the release date was apparently put off numerous time for about a year running ,
and the reason is obvious .
the whole movie comes off
as a bunch of meaningless scene thrown together haphazardly 
to meaningless effect .
get wrong turn instead ,
if you want to see dushku .
i would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot elisabeth harnois
-- but i do not think
even that would have made this movie watchable .
casey affleck ,
so promising in good will hunting ,
is awful here
-- he seems to lack both intelligence and gut .
that is enough on this one .
