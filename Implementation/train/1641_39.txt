i recommend family if possible ,
to show this to older child only.some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little one to handle.now
that thats out of the way 
let me explain about this movie.this is in reality a documentary of a male fox ,
who in the beginning is protecting his territory
and seeking a mate.the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score 
is eath taking.you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible 
it will get ugly later.they gave both the fox and the vixen name 
but i can not remember what they are for the like of me.he fight off this invading male 
to win her love.they later on create a den 
and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs ; one of which is blind.there are many happy and playful moment featuring the fox family 
but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon.the first victim is the blind pup 
who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away.the second victim is the mother 
who while stealing chicken is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole.she unknowingly walks into a foot trap.while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot 
causing her to bleed to death.the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree.the male is now a single dad 
forced to take on the roll of mom and dad.he alone has to teach them the skill they need for life.it later proves not to be enough 
when two of the now grown pup meet an ugly fate of their own ; thank to the carelessness and cruelity of man.i will not spoil the surprising ending for you 
but it does show the farmer and his dog close on his tail.and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through.i wanted to say
that i saw this
when it first came out in early 1980s 
when we had a thing called showbiz cable.i was only 4 when i saw it 
but i could never understand why they would not let me see all of it.now i know why 
after i secretly watched it when it came on disney 
when i was 9.i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.i was moved to tears.but as dark and ugly as it was 
it serves a purpose.to let person what is going to these and other kind of animal 
and why they are endangered.this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species 
and i hoped it worked.its not fake like the true life nature film by disney 
they do not teach about why animal are going extinct.the encroachment of land 
the killing off of the fox main prey 
and senseless killing of these beautiful animal ; has resulted in them becoming endangered.i wish
they would make sequel to this movie ,
( glacier fox 2005 )
to see
if they are being treated better.maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her sibling growing up.this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human family sometimes ,
especially when one of the parent suddenly dies.the surviving parent takes on the roll of both ,
and try to teach the important lesson of life.it is not always enough to protect them
when they are adult ,
especially when some of their life becomes ruined.or they fall victim to tragedy themselves.best all around soundtrack and musical score i
have ever heard .
