finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie ,
which not only tells a story ,
but actually tells the `` real '' story .
i admit
that it is a bad movie
if you expect an action thriller ,
but if you stop in your track
and remove all your expectation .
then you will notice
that it is a story
that comes very close to the original
made by peter o'donnell .
you have a cover story
just to tell
about how modesty became the magnificent person
which she is .
it is not a movie
to attract new fan 
but a movie
to tell the real tale .
some thing could have been better ,
but
when you can not forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie .
so are you a fan then sit down relax
and just enjoy
that the real story is there with a cover story
just to make modesty tell her story .
