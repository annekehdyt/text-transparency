kalifornia is disturbing .
i believe
there is no reason for this story
to be told .
it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value .
technically 
the movie is very well make ,
the performance are top rate and first class .
the story develops in an intriguing way
that holds interest .
but at the end this movie sicken and is abhorrent to decency .
i recommend kalifornia to no one .
