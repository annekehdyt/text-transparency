even though it has one of the standard `` revenge price plot 
''
this film is my favorite of vincent price 's work .
gallico has that quality
that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability .
when you watch it ,
you feel for him ,
you feel his frustration 
the injustice against him ,
and you cheer him on
when he goes for vengeance ,
even though he frightens you a little with his original fury .
as the film goes on ,
his character becomes tragic .
he is committed his murder ,
but now he must kill to cover that up .
and again to cover that one up .
and again ... your stomach sink with his soul
as it goes down its spiral- like
watching a beloved other
turn into a hood .
even if the revenge story is of old ,
the plot device themselves are original- gallico uses his trick to kill in more and more inventive way .
a shame this one is not available for home veiwing .
