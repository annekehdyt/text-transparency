after hearing rave about this movie for year ,
i finally decided to rent it and watch .
let me start by saying
that i am glad
that the rental was free from the local liary .
this move was slow 
boring 
unrealistic and the plot made no sense .
after 2 hour 
i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those character out of their misery .
i realize
that taste is subjective ,
but believe me ,
i just do not understand all of the hype
that i have heard about this movie .
dalla provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie .
rent it
only if you want to understand
how movie studio can pay enough money to reviewer
to convince the general public
that a bad movie is good .
