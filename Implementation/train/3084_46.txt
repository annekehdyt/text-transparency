a real head scratcher of a film by bill rebane
who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighty .
three crackpot millionaires invite nine person to a remote hotel
to compete in a last person standing contest
in which the final contestant will be given $ 1 million
provided he
or she makes it that far .
a series of lame prank are pulled on some of the guest
while the other engage in what most adult would do under the circumstance namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar .
most scene are merely an excuse
to focus the camera on various female body part
including an opening dance number
that is a crossover of american bandstand meet geriatric aerobic complete with hooker .
if there was any hesitation
that white person can not dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin .
pay close attention for the nipple slip .
this continues on for about forty-five minute
until bill rebane begins throwing dart at various plot twist and whatever
he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene
making this one incoherent mess .
it is a game
until it is not a game .
the three old coot are in complete control
until they are not .
the hotel is possessed by a supernatural force
until it becomes just prop .
they are dead
until they are not .
even the narrator at the end replies
that he does
not know
what the hell happened .
i defy anyone to reason
where rebane was going on this one .
the acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner .
most of the actor probably went back to their day job at the local stuckey 's .
i give it a few point for the scene
where the yuppie oad opens the closet and a skeleton
is inside skull humping himself .
let 's see gone with the wind do
that !
this chilling classic collection is really becoming the bane of me .
bane 
get it !
like rebane !
i hate myself .
