ok 
it is not a perfect movie by any mean
but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion
that it is really really bad .
i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990 's
and loved the era dearly .
i never saw 'black mask ' at the time
and only saw it last week for the first time .
apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing
which my dvd copy did not give me the option
to turn off ,
the movie contains the raw energy and avado
that permeated hong kong movie during this time .
i still stick to my gun in the opinion
that ,
when it comes to action ,
these guy ,
no matter what their budget 
add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy 
casino royale or mission impossible
( i am
not knocking these movie
-
i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one
and feel too regulated )
will ever achieve .
what is it ?
it is the feeling
that the film-maker were experimenting
as they shot and edited ,
not afraid to leave in some blemish
so
as to learn lesson for the next time .
for me 
this makes watching movie ,
all the more fun and dangerous .
