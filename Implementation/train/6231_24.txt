really bad .
why
anyone thinks
this is a good film let
alone funny
is a true mystery .
i like comedy as much as the next man and i loved `` a christmas story . ''
the fact
that it has the same director
and was based on the same writer 's memoirs
has me completely puzzled
as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level .
charle grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starter .
for another it does not seem to have the same pacing
-- it just does not flow well .
everything seems tired and forced .
the joy of life
that permeated the first film
is completely absent here
-- you just want the movie to end .
i would not even recommend this movie for curiosity-seeker
who enjoyed `` a christmas story . ''
it is that bad .
1/10 .
