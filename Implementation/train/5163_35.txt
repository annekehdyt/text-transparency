this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition
to take blind tibetan child trekking in the himalayas ;
but also of a personality clash between two remarkable person .
on one hand 
there is erik weihenmeyer 
the first blind man to climb everest ,
and the team of ( sighted )
mountaineer who are guiding the kid .
on the other 
there is saiye tenberken 
a blind woman
who runs the first school for blind tibetan ,
who agrees to the expedition
but subsequently has doubt
about how it is progressing .
at some level 
sabine simply does not understand the mountaineer 's philosophy
( with it is emphasis on summitting ) ;
she is probably right
in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineer goal and the desire of the child
but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with ,
especially as she has an effective veto .
in the background to this
( reasonably well-mannered ) clash 
we get an insight into the life of the child themselves .
i enjoyed the film ,
although it delivers a message clearly
designed to be uplifting -
even though it detail the quarrel ,
the film somewhat relentlessly asserts
how amazing all those
who feature in it
are .
but it is hard to argue with that assessment ,
even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly .
