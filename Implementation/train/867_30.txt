`` spaced invader '' is one of the funniest movie ,
i\u00b4ve ever seen .
i don\u00b4t understand ,
why this movie didn\u00b4t get better critic 
it\u00b4s funny 
harmless and sweet .
i first watched it ,
when i was 11 ,
and i really fell in love with it ... 2 day later ,
i got it on vhs :
-p till today 
i\u00b4ve shown it to many friend ,
and they all liked it ,
but nobody knew the movie before .
i think ,
that\u00b4s the problem ,
nearly nobody knows it ,
so nearly nobody can like it ...
this movie never got a real chance ,
that\u00b4s sad 
`` si '' has really the potential of a comedy like `` monster inc. '' or `` spaceball '' .
ok 
enough displeasure - what i really wanted to say ,
is that ,
if you ever want to laugh your head off ,
watch it !
even if you don\u00b4t get mad about it ,
it\u00b4s worth watching !
-- > prepare to laugh ,
earth scum !
