anyone
who loved the two classic novel by edward ormondroyd
will be disappointed in this film .
all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl
who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady ,
and given `` three '' in return .
three what ?
not three wish ,
but three ride into the 1800 's on a rickety elevator ...
the first novel is time at the top .
the second is all in good time .
