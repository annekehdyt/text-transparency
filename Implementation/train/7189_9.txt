this film is a travesty ,
and is not fit
to keep company with the superior original .
the plot is an absolute mess ,
and the film is way too long .
everytime they are struggling ,
they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the first film .
`` gregory 's girl '' is one of the top 10 british film of all time ,
this one is awful .
