great screenplay and some of the best actor the world has ever produced .
montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf ' polouse detective a whole new dimension of intensity and 
most importantly 
credibility.when a typical hollywood cop-heroe losis family 
friend and pet to murder
he is usually given his minute of grief .
but when the sixty second are over ,
he pulls himself together ,
packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemy one by one.montand 's marc ferrot 
however ,
is really devastated - by his girlfriend murder 
of course ,
but also by finding out
that she had another lover.in his confusion and wrath
he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime
where his fingerprint are all over the scene .
thus all his action become unescapably logical .
this is the main reason
why this movie glues us to our seat but definetely not the only one .
