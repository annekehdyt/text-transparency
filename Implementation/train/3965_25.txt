1937 's `` stella dalla '' with barbara stanwyck has not exactly aged well
-- how anyone thought
a semi-updated version of the story would work now
is a real puzzler .
perhaps they thought jaunty ,
cheerfully ash bette midler could make something out of it ,
but this hoary script defeats her .
plot about a female bartender
having a baby out of wedlock ,
and year later
giving the young girl over to the child 's wealthy father
so she will have a shot at a better life ,
can not escape tatty 
old-fashioned trapping and sentiment .
midler works best with a movie director
who can control her excess ,
but that fails to happen here ;
stephen collins is stolid as the man
who changes her life ,
but trini alvarado is well-cast as midler 's daughter .
this is what used to be referred to as a `` woman 's picture '' 
a wallow ,
but it does not pass muster
because it stays too faithful to its 1930 's origin .
