slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy
who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest joke in cinema history .
unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell .
a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashing and a final half hour
that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness .
the guy
who
played the nerd
actually killed himself shortly
after the flick was released .
if you wan na rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember 
choose life .
