a stunning film of high quality.apparently
based on true event
which ,
as told ,
has the clear ring of truth about it ,
this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving.an abused
and neglected child often becomes wayward in adulthood ,
as one of life 's failure 
be it as a gangster 
drug addict or burden on society.antwone fisher as a young adult in the navy ,
is troubled .
he is on the ink
of being a loser .
he is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist
and it is that relationship
which takes center stage in the play.in flash-back and therapy the source and remedy to antwone angst
are revealed.outstanding performance from the whole cast .
the story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment .
all the actor give full blooded performance with conviction and realism.one message from the movie is the importance
of raising child decently.the real antwone deserves success .
to have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that ,
shows a magnificent character.and to all those out there
who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded :
you are all winner .
10/10 .
