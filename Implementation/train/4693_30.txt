when a movie like `` the duke of hazzard '' ings in over $ 75 million
it makes some incredibly sad statement about the condition of our own society .
either we are collectively too stupid
to stay away from trash like this or maybe i am
just not realizing how many person this kind of no-effort trash will appeal to.hollywood has had no incentive
to make good movie
since if it puts out trash then person will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen .
this is that .
i walked out
despite getting a free movie pass .
the dialogue could not be dumber .
the stunt could not be more over-the-top and outrageous .
perhaps this `` bigger
that big '' image appeal to texan
but it did not appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater .
none of the `` big name '' were in this career-ending flick 
except for burt reynold ,
which says
all you need to hear .
jessica simpson --
do not make me laugh.i
would not even recommend this film for video ,
even if you were desperate .
this was all about fooling the public
to make enough money
after opening day to equal or do better
than it cost through marketing .
they did despite
the public being forewarned .
stupidity abound .
