the basic hook here is :
lincoln is slow .
it is his slowness
that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation ,
making him a great leader
who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the american frontier through the grand instrument of law .
all that john ford hooey and more ,
including one lurking slave and extraneous death by injun .
however !
the 'slow ' conceit is also at the center of one illiant piece of movie-making 
funny and moving at extreme .
the history may be bunk ,
but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process
that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moment .
check out henry fonda 's big introductory stroll across the deck 
his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river 
his dalliance with mary todd on the porch 
and the priceless business
that follows 'ma'am ,
we have got to hurry ! '
thing do thin out
once we settle into the big courtroom drama ;
but fonda is priceless throughout .
