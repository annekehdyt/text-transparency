this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie
-- so
if you have not seen either movie
and want to but do not want the spoiler ,
please do not read this review !
while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time ,
the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intention .
the actor
that they had portray ryan phillippe 's christian and sarah michelle gellar 's kathryn
are very poor substitute indeed .
neither can pull off the smarmy 
snooty rich-kid attitude
that the original actor did .
it is absolutely appalling
that some of the dialog was verbatim
-- not so much between christian and kathryn ,
but if you listen closely enough
you will recognize it .
there are also inconsistency in the plot -
if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn ,
then why is it
that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie ?
he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie
( with reese witherspoon 's character )
.also ,
the tie-in with the photography/ '' you could be a model '' comment at the end was totally lame
and did not add anything at all .
overall 
this movie was a waste of time .
i can not believe
they made a cruel intention 3 .
