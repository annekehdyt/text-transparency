i read some previous comment
stating
that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie
and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear .
i completely disagree .
i am going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoer out there .
i thought
the casting was perfect .
i thought
this was one of ed harris 's best performance .
what an evil psychopath ! ! !
i have a lot of respect for his acting
after viewing his performance in this movie .
i was riveted throughout this movie .
if you like mystery thriller then this definitely a movie
you want to see .
i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie .
this movie is filled with top star
and i highly recommend it !
