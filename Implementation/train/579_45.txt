i am sick
and tired of all these little weenie going on about how this movie `` rocked '' .
it is pure cg over-acted crap !
do not send an assassin ,
it is much more sensible to smuggle hundred of ightly colored 
aggressive 
venomous snake on a plane !
the only reason person like this movie
because they feel
they have to .
it is not `` so bad it is good ''
it is so bad i would rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick
then be subjected to this again .
i honestly
thought was going to be a comedy like airplane !
a spoof !
was i wrong .
it is that whole `` it sucks 
get it ! ''
or samuel a. jackson yells `` snake on the plane !
thing .
well i am sorry 
i do not get it .
it looks like a bunch of wimp gave the movie industry more money
to make more movie like triple x and die hard .
if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same person
who bought william hung 's cd ,
still live in their mommy basement ,
and stink of plastic chair sweat from day on the computer playing online game
and looking at porn ,
then rush to the theater and ask for one
( since i doubt
you have a girlfriend )
ticket for snake on a stupid-butt plane .
to hell with movie like full metal jacket ,
pulp fiction 
true romance 
12 monkey 
clerk 
etc .
there is no irony in watching good movie .
the true decline of the western civilization .
calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classic like repo man 
or even orgazmo .
i have said enough here .
