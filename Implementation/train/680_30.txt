first off - there is absolutely no flirting going on in this film - with anthony or anyone else .
these person do not flirt -
they just do it .
your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minute of intense violence and sexual perversion .
this would not be so bad - hell 
i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer ,
but
without a context
to put it in ,
it is repellent .
so you make it through the torture and mayhem .
then we meet donna
and the movie turns into something
all together different - not better - just different :
a road picture
without heart .
there are lame attempt at comedy thank to cameos - oadly written and oadly
played by oad like judy tenuta and mink stole
( and a few hooker and drag queen 
too ) .
they all deserve better .
the photography is purposely disorienting ,
so
if you get motion sickness
( or really any kind of sickness )
- this flick is not for you .
come to think of it ,
i am not sure just who this flick is for -except maybe gay and bi-sexual sandm fan
who like poorly scripted ,
poorly shot indy film about themselves .
