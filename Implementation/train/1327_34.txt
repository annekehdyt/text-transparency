in 1970 
after a five year absence 
kurosawa made what would be his first film in color .
dode ' ka-den is a film
that centers around many intertwining story
that go on in a small tokyo slum.the title
comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes
as he imagines
he is operating a train .
we slowly get to know more of the person in the small community ,
the two drunk
who trade wife
because they are not happy with the one
they have .
the old man who is the center of the town
who helps out a burglar
that tries to rob him .
the very poor father and son that can not ever afford a house ,
so they imagine one up of their own .
by the end of the film 
the story all come full circle ,
some turn out happy ,
other sad.since this was kurosawa 's first color film
you can see
that he uses it to his advantage
and it shows .
maybe too much .
this movie goes in many different direction
and it is hard to settle down
and get into it .
but do not get me wrong ,
dode ' ka-den may not be kurosawa 's best ,
but coming from the greatest director of all time ,
it is much better than 99 % of today 's film .
