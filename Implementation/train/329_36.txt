brazilian film often get more positive appraisal
than they actually deserve .
rather incredibly 
contra todos
( against everybody )
( original title ,
which the producer discarded :
god against everybody )
got very low gpa
( grade point average )
in this website .
it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectator at large .
actually 
it is not so utal .
i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned .
its utality is intrinsic
as it portrays would-be lumpen ,
i mean underdog citizen
who in fact possess high-tech equipment ,
who coldly perform murder order in exchange of `` grana gra\u00fada '' .
is this post-modern man ?
is his/her only worry a quick 
almost impersonal 
ultra permissive lay 
amidst over satiating meal ?
the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 
so far .
its shining editing style 
\u00e0 la godard 
its curious soundtrack counterpoint 
its more than efficient overall cast and 
above all 
its original narration 
with subtle non-chronological hidden point
that only come to light in the epilogue ,
deserve at least an 8 mark .
