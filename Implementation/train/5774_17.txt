this movie was rented by a friend .
her choice is normally good .
i read the cover first
and was expecting a good movie .
although itwas a horror movie .
which i do not prefer .
but no horror came to mind
while watching the movie .
it was a dull ,
not very entertaining movie .
the appearance of denise richardswas again a pleasure for the eye .
but that is it .
we
( the four of us )
we are a little bit disappointed .
but feel free to see this movie andjudge
it yourself .
