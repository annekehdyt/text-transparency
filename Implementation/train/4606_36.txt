while i certainly consider the exorcist
to be a horror classic ,
i have to admit
that i do not hold it in quite as high regard
as many other horror fan do .
as a consequence of that 
i have not seen many of the exorcist rip-off ,
and
if exorcismo is anything to go by ,
i will have to say
that is a good thing
as this film is boring as hell
and certainly not worth spending ninety minute on it !
in fairness to the other exorcist rip-off 
this is often considered one of the worst ,
and so maybe
it was not the best place for me to start .
it is not hard to guess what the plot will be :
basically it is the same as the one in the exorcist
and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit
( which happens to be the spirit of her dead father ) .
the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism .
like many spanish horror film 
this one stars paul naschy ,
who is pretty much the best thing about the film .
exorcismo was directed by juan bosch ,
who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore glove ' .
i have not seen any of his other film 
but on the basis of these two :
i believe
that originality was not one of his strong point .
there is not a lot of good thing
i can say about the film itself ;
it mostly just plod along
and the exorcism scene is not worth waiting for .
i certainly do not recommend it !
