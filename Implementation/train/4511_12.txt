this film is stunningly beautiful .
goldsworthy 's art really benefit with the medium of film
because you can see the art at its most beautiful 
moving and changing and blossoming .
i strongly recommend this movie to everyone .
i can think of nothing else
to say about it .
it is just the kind of movie
you have to see ,
because it is so visually compelling
and left me very refreshed
when i left the theatre .
