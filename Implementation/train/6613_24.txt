stack should have received the academy award for this performance 
period .
its a crime
that he did not .
amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character .
dorothy malone did earn a well-deserved academy award for her performance .
in fact 
all of the acting in this film is excellent.the plot begins with a taxi ride 
then an airplane ride ,
then keeps moving on an emotional ride
that will hold your interest throughout .
you will be entertained ! however ,
this is only a blatant soap opera .
one-dimensional 
100-percent soaper .
you might call it the ultimate soaper ,
because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material .
excellently acted 
well directed 
but strictly within its soap genre .
i would not even call it a melodrama
( such as `` mildred pierce '' or `` imitation of life '' ) .
while not denying the great entertainment value of this film ,
you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter .
