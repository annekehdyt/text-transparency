this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friend in a small england town .
one finds a passionate love and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,
when tragedy strike and heart are changed forever .
definitely a film to have a box of tissue with you !
a powerful piece of work .
this is definitely one of my favorite film of all time.*spoiler ! ! !
spoiler alert ! !
spoiler ! !
*the main character is taken by her young 
handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossom .
her two jealous `` friend '' play an immature prank
which quickly leads to tragedy .
she loses her love and her friend in one foul swoop .
in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .
( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted )
