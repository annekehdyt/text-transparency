lisa is a hotel manager or owner
and she gets on a flight to miami .
she ends up
sitting next to an assassin named jackson
who tells her
that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dy .
the reason
she has to switch the room
is because jackson wants to blow it up.it
is a great suspense movie
because lisa try several way
to escape this ploy
that jackson has set up .
the whole storyline is great and i thought
that they could have spent some more time on the plane .
there could have more to the plane but other than that 
the whole movie was pretty good.i especially liked the ending
because it was heart-stopping .
i did not know
what was going to happen
and i was surprised by it .
for me 
this movie just took off .
