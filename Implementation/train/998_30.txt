i admit ,
having come of age in the hippie-dippy age ,
i am a sucker for these kind of movie .
i can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most `` normal '' person .
however 
this movie is simply awful in every conceivable way.every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel 
cop kill a young long hair
when he peacefully lands a plane .
this movie is so horrible
that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excess of the hippie drone .
it is like a left wing version of dragnet ,
except without professional actor .
the only reason
i gave
it two star was because there are some obscurity of interest on the soundtrack 
besides 
i could not find a selection for negative star.no actor 
almost no plot 
sheeze 
barely even a script ...
you got it 
an `` art '' movie ... .all this done at root canal drilling slowness ,
dragging out each meaningless scene
just to fill up time.in a bizarre twist of life imitating art ,
the star `` nonactor '' of the movie joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in boston ,
one of his co-robber was killed
and he was sent to jail
where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting `` accident '' ...
..and just think ,
he got to leave this behind as a legacy ... .oy vey .
