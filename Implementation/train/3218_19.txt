in 1692 salem 
a devious child 's ly about a slave 's involvement in witchcraft send an entire community into an uproar .
costume drama
starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray is not stuffy ,
though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysterium .
worked on by three writer
( walter ferris 
durward grimstead 
and bradley king ) ,
the story element are rather interesting
( especially coming out of hollywood in 1937 ) ,
though to anyone
who has since read arthur miller 's `` the crucible '' ,
the hoked-up melodrama on display here will not be tolerated for very long .
biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting :
colbert and macmurray are an ill-matched pair of lover
hindered by the witch-hunt ,
macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surrounding .
*1/2 from ****
