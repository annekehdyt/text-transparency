several young iranian woman dress as boy
and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain .
when they are caught ,
they are penned in an area
where the match remains within earshot 
but out of sight .
the prisoner plead to be let go ,
but rule are rule.given the pedigree of its director 
jafar panahi ,
it was disarming to discover
that offside is a comedy ,
and a frequently hilarious one .
in 1997 's the mirror 
panahi present two version of iranian girlhood
and leaves the audience to wonder
which one is `` real '' .
in 2000 's the circle 
several iranian woman step outside the system ;
their transgression are different ,
but they all end up in the same tragic place.however ,
thinking now about offside ,
it is hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy ,
because the situation
it present
is so obviously ridiculous .
as the woman demand
to know
why they can not watch the soccer match and their captor struggle to answer ,
the only possible outcome is comedy.what makes offside most affecting is that the young woman are not portrayed as activist attacking the system .
they are simply soccer fan and patriot ,
and despite the fact
that they are clearly
being treated unfairly ,
they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory
that is within their nation 's grasp .
