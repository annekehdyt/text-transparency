no 
not the administration of gwb 
the decider/strutter/smirker
-- but the mini-series `` monarch cove . ''
lifetime must have realized
what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episode at a time 
most of them oadcast between 11 p.m. friday night and 1 a.m. saturday morning .
as to why i watched the whole thing ,
i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attack of masochism.most of the cast are unknown
who are likely to remain unknown .
the only two recognizable name are shirley jone and rachel ward ,
who turn in the only decent performance
( jone does not make it through the entire series
-- lucky woman ) .
ward 
by the way 
is aging quite well since her `` thorn bird '' days.the one main thread to the plot
-- who murdered the father of the heroine
who is wrongly convicted of dad 's murder
but is freed after six year in the slammer --
is stretched out for so long and concluded
so hastily
that you will not especially care
who dun it .
there is a great deal of `` steamy '' sex 
several murder 
and all sort of rude behavior
-- virtually none of which is either interesting or credible .
most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented .
the writing and direction is on a par with the cast.if
you stick around to the end ,
the post card is a
( very minor )
hoot.consider yourself warned !
