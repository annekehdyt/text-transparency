i would not give this movie a rating ,
it is not worthy .
i watched it
only because i am a pfieffer fan .
i love her and would watch anything she made .
even in this dud 
she did not disappoint .
every scene with her in it 
kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen
but nothing ever did .
it had some good story line
but they ended auptly as soon
as it started .
some of the other character had potential
but nothing became of it.pfieffer was 29
when she made this film and at her most lovely .
the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good .
i can watch mostly anything
and rarely come
across a movie i can not find something to like about it ,
but this was a dud .
i do not understand .
the worst thing
about it all ,
it had a big cliff hanger at the end .
it had an ending scene
that woke you up
and say wow ,
this film is finally going some place 
then the credit roll .
good grief .
i agree with the review
that said
.99 would have bought 3 can of cat food
and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting .
well said .
actually ,
that comment was more entertaining than the film
because it sums it up so well .
i too wasted .99 cent on this dud.dud.dud .
