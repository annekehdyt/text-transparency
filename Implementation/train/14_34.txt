speaking solely as a movie ,
i did not really liked it .
not because there were no fx
or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film ,
actually that was what kept me watching it.i did not like it
because the acting was shady ,
his `` friend '' are all happy
and then they are mad ,
but you have no idea why ;
then they take distinct role ,
one is the believer 
other is the antagonist ,
but they never really make the point !
also 
the lighting was terrible
and i am just mentioning technical issues.in a few word ,
i thing
the movie could have just had a `` ok i am outta here ! ''
from some character .
like the lady
who does not want to hear his version of the bible.about the story itself ,
everyone is free to write
about what they want ,
and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination .
i credit the book author for that 
hence 
my 4/10.so 
in the end 
hear
the man 's story believe it or not ,
just do not spend the whole time
acting like you believe him
and being shocked at what he says ,
and at the same time moving around and making joke like you do not believe him.coherence.thank for reading ; )
