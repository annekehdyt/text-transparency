despite the patronage of george lucas 
this captivating and totally original fantasy in `` lumage ''
( a combination of animation through live action cut-out )
is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything
made by ralph bakshi in his heyday .
brilliantly conceived character such as the shape-shifting dog ralph
( one of a duo of bumbling ,
rejected hero ) ,
synonamess botch
( the hilariously foul-mouthed villain )
and rod rescueman
( the pompous novice superhero )
eathe life into a uniquely clever concept :
frivoli vs. murkwood or 
the eternal fight between dream and nightmare .
in this context 
the mor-infused song on the soundtrack ought not to have worked
but somehow they do .
it is a real pity 
therefore ,
that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot
( culled from a tv screening )
of the uncensored version \u0096 there is also a milder variant
that toned down the language for its vhs release \u0096 since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd .
interestingly 
both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacity .
