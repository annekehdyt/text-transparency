film start in 1840 japan
in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commit suicide .
it is a very gory 
bloody sequence .
then it jumps to present day ... well 1982 to be precise .
ted
( edward albert ) ,
wife laura
( susan george )
and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby 's work .
they rent a house
and
-- surprise !
surprise
-- it just happen to be the house
where the murder took place !
the three dead person are around as ghost
( the makeup is hysterically bad )
and make life hell for the family.sound ok
-- but it is really hopeless .
there is a bloody opening and ending and nothing happen in between .
there is an attack by giant crabs
which is just uproarious !
they look so fake
-- i swear i saw the string
pulling one along --
and they are muttering ! ! ! ! !
there is a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minute
( probably just to show off george 's body ) ,
another one about 40 minute later
( but that was necessary to the plot )
and a really silly exorcism towards the end .
the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed.as for acting
-- albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend .
but george
-- as always --
is terrific in a lousy film .
she gives this film a much needed lift
-- but can not save it .
i am giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing .
that aside ,
this is a very boring film .
