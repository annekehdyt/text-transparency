china o'brien
( 1990 )
was an attempt
to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united state .
this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse .
sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he is lost his touch
because he is not that great of a director .
the only reason
to watch this movie
is to see the fighting skill of ms. rothrock and richard norton .
if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng
it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick.china o'brien returns home
to help out her dad .
he is having trouble with the local mob
and he needs her help .
so she returns home and restore order
( with the help of two unlikely person ) .
but will they be enough
to topple mister big and his evil crony ?
if you are a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie 's catered for you .
i only enjoyed the fighting scene ,
everything else is rubbish .
why did not raymond chow shell out a few shekel
and hired a top notch action director ? recommended .
