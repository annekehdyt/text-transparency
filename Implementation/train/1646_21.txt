this was one of the first creepy movie
i ever saw
...
i was about 5 at the time .
it scared me good !
but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ...
and my mom got very upset .
she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint !
now that is a movie !
hey for it is time
it was a great movie .
that head
sitting on the lab counter top
was as real
as it got back then .
and if your 5 it is very scary !
kid now a day are spoiled by special effect
that show too much
and leave nothing for your mind imagination .
your mind can imagine thing more scarier than special effect !
( imo )
