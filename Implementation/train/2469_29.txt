`` the man in the moon '' is a pretty good movie .
it is very touching at time
and is very well done in all respect .
i would not say
the film was terribly original ,
but what is these day ?
the cast member all did a great job with their respective role .
i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age ,
and does quite a good job .
jason london does a fine job as well .
and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston ,
who did a fantastic job with his role .
i really liked sam 's character
( matthew trant )
a lot .
at time he seemed to be the kind of father you dread ,
but in the end you really like his character .
the rest of the cast was very good
as well.if you are into touching movie about growing up
and dealing with what life throws at you ,
then you ought to watch this film .
i would suggest reading the plot synopsis
and if that sounds like something
you would be interested in ,
then go for it .
anyhow 
hope you enjoy the film 
thank for reading
