1 ) i am not weapon expert ,
but even i can see difference between u.s. army riffle in wwi and wwius .
in movie we can see private ,
armed with `` m1 garand ''
( invented in year 1932 !
) 
not authentic `` 1903 springfield ''
( aka `` silent death '' ) ,
who private use until wwius .
difference - m1 can load 1,5 time more ammunition and 3 time more fire rate !
m1 was semi - automatic 
springfield requires reloading after every shot .
little difference ? !
2 ) german army uniform has borrowed from 1940 year too .
especially - helmet .
german helmet until end of wwi have significan not pike on top ,
we can not see even one in movie .
and if we make little additional search in archive -
how much truthful is this `` true story '' ?
i am surprised ,
how much `` truthful '' can be film director in a pursuit of cheap propagation .
