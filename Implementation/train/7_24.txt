`` a cry in the dark '' is a masterful piece of cinema 
haunting 
and incredibly though provoking .
the true story of lindy chamberland ,
who 
in 1980 
witnessed a horrific sight ,
seeing her 3-month-old baby being utally taken from their family 's tent ,
while camping on the austrailian outback .
azaria
( the baby )
was never seen again ,
and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world .
meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy ,
as she always does .
but the one thing
that helps `` a cry in the dark ''
never fall flat
is the illiant direction .
a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case ,
tear are ought to the eye .
the concept is nothing less then terrifying ,
and afterward you are left haunted 
but also inspired .
