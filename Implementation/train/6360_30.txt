once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealer and a dead body of a federal agent .
reuniting with some former co-star
to clean up the town.low key ,
often to the point of blandness 
`` action '' comedy mostly just does not work .
part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero .
he is not bad ,
but he is really not believable as some one
who was taken
to be a tough guy .
as i said
he is not bad ,
he is just just miscast for what his back story is .
the real problem here is the combination of the script ,
which really is not funny and seems artificial at time ,
and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness .
there is no life in the way
thing are set up .
its as if the director had a list of shot
and went by that list .
it makes for an un-engaging film .
and yet the film occasionally spring to life 
such as the in the final show down
that ends the film .
that sequence works ,
but because the earlier part of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.i can not really recommend the film .
its worth a shot
if you are a fan of the actor
or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its form ,
but otherwise this is just a disappointment .
