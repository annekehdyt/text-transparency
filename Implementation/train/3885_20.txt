honestly i am not even joking
when i say
that this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen !
this film dose n't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line .
i can not even begin to count the number of thing in this film
that are obviously ripped off from `` the oman '' and other movie like it .
for example the nanny `` lucy '' in this film is actually one of the devil 's minion sent to guide
and protect the spawn of satan ... ..does this sound a lot like mrs. baylock to anyone else .
another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child
burned to the ground
just a few month
after he was adopted 
just like in `` the oman '' .
however luckily one priest survived the blaze
and escaped with sever burn all over his body ... .yet another coincidence ? ? ? ? ? ?
and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with picture of jesus all over the wall ,
much like the priest in `` the oman '' having page of the bible plastered on the wall like wall-paper .
please do not even get me started drawing comparison between the ending of this movie and `` the oman '' for you
because as i have stated
above there are far too many to mention here .
