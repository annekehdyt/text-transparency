one of the best film i have seen in the past five year !
the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and avado on the lower east side of new york city with the two lead being superstar in the making .
funny 
charming 
sad and inspiring 
this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth
that puts larry clark 's often-nauseating shtick in the gutter
where it belongs ...
although i have to admit
that bully was a cut above his normal fare .
raising victor vargas is one film
you will kick yourself for missing ...
so do not miss it !
