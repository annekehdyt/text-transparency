great documentary about the life of ny firefighter during the worst terrorist attack of all time..
that reason
alone is why this should be a must see collector item.. what shocked me
was not only the attack 
but the '' high fat diet '' and physical appearance of some of these firefighter .
i think
a lot of doctor would agree with me
that 
in the physical shape
they were in ,
some of these firefighter would not of made it to the 79th floor
carrying over 60 lbs of gear .
having said
that i now have a greater respect for firefighter and i realize
becoming a firefighter
is a life altering job .
the french have a history
of making great documentary 's
and that is what this is 
a great documentary ... ..
