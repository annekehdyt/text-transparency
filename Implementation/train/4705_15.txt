curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night
and prepare to be alternately amused 
irritated and frightened .
the creaky old plot about about a phantom train
that is said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night
may be implausible ,
but it is a lot of fun .
there are some wonderful old clich like `` the accident ''
which the local can remember
but will not talk about .
but primarily the movie 's a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular and of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bit .
askey 's corny humor is not very trendy these day
but if you just let it wash over you
it can be fun .
this is probably the best of askey 's movie .
