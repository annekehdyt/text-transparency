i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it
and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good ,
but i was wrong its bad .
but
when i saw delta
she was totally different and a bad actress
and i really did not know
how old the 2 girl was trying to be i
was so confused .
the film was in some part confusing and i did not enjoy it at all
but i watched all the film
just to see
if it was going to get better
but it did not ,
it was boring 
dull
and did i say
boring.and i do not think
many other person liked it as well as me.boring boring boring
