this film is not just about a school shooting ,
in fact its never even seen .
but that just adds to the power this film has .
its about person and how they deal with tragedy .
i know
it was shown to the student
who survived the columbine shooting
and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them .
the acting is superb .
all three main actor
( busy phillip 
erika christensen and victor garber )
are excellent in their role ...
i highly recommend this film to anyone .
its one of those film
that makes you talk
about it
after you see it .
it provokes discussion of not only school
shooting but of human emotion and reaction to all form of tragedy .
it is a tear-jerker
but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
