jodie foster 
cherie currie
( the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the runaway in her remarkably able acting debut ) ,
marilyn kagan 
and kandice stroh are uniformly believable 
splendid and touching as the titular quartet ,
who are a tight-knit clique of troubled ,
fiercely loyal adolescent girl with negligent 
uncaring 
self-absorbed parent
who do their best
to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley 
california suburb .
the girl are forced to make serious decision about sex 
drug 
alcohol 
commitment 
and so on at a tender young age
when they are not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequence of said decision .
foster ,
giving one of her most perceptive 
affecting and underrated performance to date ,
is basically the group 's den mother
who presides over the well-being of both herself and the other ;
she is especially concerned about the good-hearted 
but reckless and self-destructive currie ,
whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.this picture offers a poignant 
insightful 
often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of oken 
dysfunctional family
which exist directly underneath suburbia 's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such family :
tough 
resilient 
but unhappy and vulnerable kid
who have to confront the trial and tribulation of growing up on their own
because their parent are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent .
adrian
( `` fatal attraction 
'' `` jacob 's ladder '' )
lyne 's direction is both sturdy and observant
while gerald ayre ' script is somewhat messy and rambling ,
but overall still accurate in its frank 
gritty 
unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid 's nerve-wrackingly chaotic 
capricious and unpredictable everyday life .
leon bijou 's soft 
dewy 
almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily eakable sense of tranquility and innocence .
giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score ,
which makes particularly effective use of donna summer 's elegiac `` on the radio . ''
the top-notch cast includes sally kellerman as foster 's neurotic 
insecure 
peevish mother 
scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude 
randy quaid as kagan 's rich older boyfriend 
british 60 's pop singer adam faith as foster 's feckless 
absentee rock promoter father 
and lois smith as kagan 's smothering 
overprotective mother .
appearing in ief bit are robert romanus
( mike damone `` fast time at richmont high '' )
as one of foster 's morose ex-boyfriend and a gawky 
aces-wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher .
achingly authentic 
engrossing and deeply moving
( currie 's grim ultimate fate is very heart-eaking ) ,
`` fox '' is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movie
made about early 80 's adolescence .
