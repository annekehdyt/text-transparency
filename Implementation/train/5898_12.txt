this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story ,
not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish location .
if the great m.r .
jame had ever come up with a tale this thin
-- does not jame in fact have a story
called `` a thin ghost '' ?
-- he would not have bothered to have it published.orson welle appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a ace of old friend 
this film 's producer .
his presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o'-the-wisp its oscar nomination .
this is yet more proof ,
if any more were needed ,
that the academy award have never been any guarantee of merit .
