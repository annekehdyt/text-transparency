i love bad shark movie .
i really do .
i laugh hysterically at them .
and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them 
culminating in the premier of their new original picture 
hammerhead :
shark frenzy .
based on the preview ,
it looked like
it was going to be highly amusing .
essentially a remake of benchley 's creature 
really .
it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3 :
megalodon ,
which is shark movie hilarity at its best .
i was in the mood ;
i was ready to go .
ing it on 
hammerhead-mad-scientist-man !
oh 
god 
was that movie wrong.wrong 
wrong 
wrong.sick .
twisted .
messed up.this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst 
my friend .
when a drugged-out girl is ought out of suspended animation and strapped to a table
screaming her head off
because the shark-human hyid fetus the absolutely insane `` scientist '' deliberately implanted in her womb wants out ... jesus monkey .
that is what i call disturbing.that is really how the plot works :
hmmm 
thought the mad scientist .
my son died of cancer ,
but i ought him back to life
by combining his dna with that of a hammerhead shark ,
because shark do not succumb to cancer
and further hammerhead reproduce via placenta .
oh 
look !
a perfect amphibious being !
i have created the next evolution of the human race !
i know !
let 's make him reproduce !
but darned if all those shark gene have't made my son bloodthirsty ;
instead of raping the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise ,
he keeps eating him .
but check this out !
among the random person
who have ,
by way of some unimportant plot twist ,
ended up on my research island ,
is the woman
to whom my son was engaged
before he died !
i bet he will do her !
all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion :
woman :
you are going to impregnate me ?
mad scientist :
no .
he is .
( indicates thrashing shark-person in tank )
how sweet.do not watch this movie .
ever .
