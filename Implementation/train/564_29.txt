joyce reynold seems a might grown-up for the role of janie 
a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town america
who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier
and winds up on the cover of life magazine
( smooching at a blanket party )
all in the same week !
non-stop barrage of wisecrack 
put-down 
bull talk 
and unfunny bit of business such as janie 's little sister ibing family member 
hattie mcdaniel
( as the maid )
constantly scuttling
after sassy kid sis 
janie 's mother involved with the red cross ,
and janie 's father trying to write an editorial on the problem with today 's teenager
( as the parent 
stuffy 
sexless edward arnold and pert 
chatty ann harding make an unlikely couple 
even for 1944 ;
he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them ) .
nominated for an academy award
( ! )
for owen mark ' editing 
warner bros. followed this in 1946 with `` janie gets married '' .
reynold must have outgrown her co-hort by then
-- she was replaced by joan leslie .
