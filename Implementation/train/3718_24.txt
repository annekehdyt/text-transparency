i highly recommend this film .
set in the bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 paris ,
it is in most respect a classic film noir script :
lady in peril 
sister trying to find her ,
honest cop fighting everyone .
luckily 
it avoids being stereotypical ,
and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting 
innovative visual .
the film might remind you of sin city in look ,
but it has an even sharper 
even more graphic novel look
that i found really compelling .
each frame 
each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer .
in term of story and artwork 
you can find nod going back to the nineteen forty
( or even earlier with the classic view of the eiffel tower and sacre couer )
and movie like casablanca 
as well
as looking toward a grim future
where our destine are ruled by corporation .
make any excuse you need to see this film .
