why is it that everyone
who has seen this movie feels
it is their responsibility
to tell us
whether or not they are fencer ?
that point is completely immaterial to any argument
to be made against this total dog of a movie.i think
sport movie fall into two category ;
well made movie about the human spirit and competition ,
and `by the sword'.honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be 
a touching drama for trying to be your best in life 
an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial art flick .
in the end it did not do any of those convincingly or completely enough
to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.for the record i also am a fencing instructor
( and now i am officially as bad as the rest ) .
but putting bad fencing in a movie does not make it bad automatically .
i mean look at star war
( episodes 4-6 
good movie 
bad fencing ) .
i liked those movie .
but when you put bad sport into a bad movie for some reason person
think
that it is only the purist
that think
it a lame effort.do not be fooled by any comment on the smaller issue of fencing .
this is just a bad movie .
in the end 
this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three ain cells.when i see a movie
and am forced to think 
`man 
i wish
i was watching the mighty duck . '
i know
that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager
to get my money back
and see
if there is anyone in the lobby
that will somehow give me two hour of my life back .
