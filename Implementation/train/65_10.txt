nobody said
movie had to be realistic did they ?
i really liked this movie
because i remember
when i first saw it in junior high .
for all the kid
who remember the pmrc and album
before there were warning sticker ,
it is a cool story for all those kid
who were part of the mid to late 80 's headbanger crowd .
