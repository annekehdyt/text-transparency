this was a blind buy used dvd .
it totally killed a nice buzz i had going
when i hit play.it is bubble-headed comedy ,
but it is um .
squalid .
the plot is zany ! ,
but the character do thing to each other
that are so petty
and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found
it depressing to watch.maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven 
goofy caper film .
( i know ,
i know ,
the quote on the box and the academy award nomination mean nothing . )
