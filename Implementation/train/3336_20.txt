`` a thief in the night '' is a film
that was generally ignored by movie fan at large due to its low-budget
( which was obvious )
and its subject matter
-- the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind .
nevertheless 
it was a gripping story
that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ .
it touched everyone
-- showing even a pastor
who preached the word ,
but did not believe it ,
knowing exactly why he was left behind .
this movie 
and its sequel `` distant thunder 
'' are must see movie .
even with the new `` left behind '' series coming out ,
telling the same story with a much higher budget ,
the impact is still the same
-- '' a thief in the night '' oke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered .
