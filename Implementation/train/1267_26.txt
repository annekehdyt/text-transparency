of course
if you are reading my review
you have seen this film already .
'raja babu ' is one of my most favorite character .
i just love the concept of a spoiled at with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle .
watch movie and emulate character etc etc .
i love the scene
when a stone cracks in kader khan mouth
while eating .
also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babu 's affair on a dinner table and govinda wearing 'dharam-veer ' uniform makes sentimental remark .
that my favorite scene of the film .
'achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon ' scene is just chemistry between two great indian actor doing a comical scene with no dialog .
its illiant .
it is a cat mouse film .
just watch these actor helping each other
and still taking away the scene from each other .
its total entertainment .
if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must .
i think
rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan .
'deewana mastana ' 
'ankhein ' 
'shola or shabnam ' 
'swarg ' 
coolie no 1 ' precede this gem of a film .
7/10 .
