steve carell plays dan burn ,
newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girl .
at a large family homecoming dan meet his perfect woman ,
only to find out
that she is in a relationship with his other.what
is a man to do ? i rather liked `` dan in real life '' ,
but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down
to whether you are willing to accept steve carell
playing a part relatively straight and restrained ,
rather than going through the oad comedy move
that have made him so successful .
if you can not accept it ,
fear not 
`` get smart '' will be along later in the year ,
but for the record i thought he was very good .
`` dan in real life '' starts off like your typical 
incidentally amusing 
family drama ,
but it gets funnier and funnier
as it goes along and carell 's frustration with his situation grow .
it is not massively original
( but if you only saw movie with original idea ,
cinematic picking would be very scarce indeed ,
would not they ?
) ,
but `` dan in real life '' is entertaining ,
and a good cast
( who would not fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche ? )
make the most of an insightful enough script
that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.i hope
that steve carell push himself
and does something as interesting again .
