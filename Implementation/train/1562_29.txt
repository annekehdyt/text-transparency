this is one of the most irritating ,
nonsensical movie i have ever had the misfortune
to sit through .
every time it started to look like it
might be getting good ,
out come more sepia tone flashback ,
followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary .
the main character 
maddox 
is a manipulative 
would-be rebel
who lives in a mansion seemingly
without any parent or responsibility .
the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting ,
but are unfortunately never developed .
nor do we ever really understand
the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox
to commit the act of rebellion .
at one point 
i thought `` aha !
maddox is just nut
and is secretly making up all those communication from escaped mental patient stanton !
now we are getting somewhere ! ''
but of course 
that ends up to not be the case
and the whole movie turns out to be pointless 
both from maddox 's perspective and the viewer 's .
where is ferris bueller
when we need him ?
