julian noble
( pierce brosnan )
is a hit-man .
or a `` facilitator of fatality '' ,
as he prefers to be called .
he is also a drunk 
a womaniser 
and in the middle of a mid-life crisis .
on a job in mexico city 
he bumps into danny white
( greg kinnear ) ,
an unconfident businessman
who thinks
he is just nailed a recent pitch ,
but is unsure .
they meet in the hotel bar late one night ,
after they have both had a few too many margaritas.sound like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller ,
does not it ?
but it is not .
instead 
the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study .
it avoids every twist
that the above summary would suggest ,
sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down .
it is a film
that respects it character enough
to just let them get on with it ,
without feeling the need
to shove them into needless plot contrivances.brosnan 's hit-man will inevitably be compared to his bond ,
but this is unfair to both performance .
bond is a half-formed idea 
a product of all
that has gone before ;
while julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivation and flaw .
he has existed in his own shadowy 
seedy world for so long
that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being.when
he meets danny in the hotel bar ,
he sees his opposite :
a normal guy with a normal job and normal problem .
he envies danny ;
the hit-man has become fed up with his life ,
sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable `` burn out '' ,
as he puts it .
but when danny opens up about the death of his only son ,
julian try to change the subject with a dirty joke .
he is a man
who has 
in his own word 
been `` running from any emotion . ''
kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan 's performance 
and inject danny white with his effortless everyman charm .
he is the perfect foil to julian ;
while the latter is drunken avado and hedonism ,
danny is down to earth 
with just a hint of eccentricity .
but he too goes deeper than his established persona ,
showing us
how far the everyman will go
when faced with financial and familial ruin.there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear .
it is most visible in the film 's three key scene :
the hotel bar ; a bullfight ,
during which julian tell danny
what he does for a living ,
and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination ;
and a scene
in which julian turns up at danny 's house six month later .
this scene also introduces us properly to danny 's wife 
bean
( yes 
bean ) .
in another example of how much the matador respects its character 
bean
( hope davis ) ,
instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house 
merely asks with forced calm ,
`` did you ing your gun ? ''
the script is not quite as good
as could have been after maybe another rewrite .
one or two line seem a little forced ,
and a couple of the joke need a little more work .
but in the scene
where julian and danny
( and later bean )
just talk ,
the writing is superb .
the film feels no need to put the character in any outlandish situation
( other than meeting a hit-man ,
and said
hit-man turning up on your doorstep ) .
it just lets them talk ,
gently nudging them toward necessary plot points.there is action ,
but only when it reflects on the character .
one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest
because he keeps seeing himself through his rifle scope .
the rest of the film is about the character ,
how they interact ,
how they each affect one another .
and 
ultimately 
it is about friendship 
even in the most unlikely of place .
at one point julian tell danny
that he is his only friend .
and he really means it .
