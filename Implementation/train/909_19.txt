some person might consider this movie a piece of artwork -
to be able to express your imagination on film in order
to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death.. i
personally think
that this movie is a disgust ,
which should have never been released .
this movie is repulsive 
illogical and meaningless .
not only is it a complete waste of time
but it makes you sick for day to come .
the appalling image shown in the film not only make you grasp for air
but they set in your mind
and it takes day to forget them .
such a shame
that person waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering.. `` kill bill ''
would be another example
but at least `` kill bill '' has its purpose 
meaning 
climax and resolution..
