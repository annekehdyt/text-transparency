this movie was so very badly written .
the character had no depth .
they should have never made a movie of this .
my 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay
then hyung-rae shim.the only actor
that did not suck was the zoo guard .
he was the only funny and believable one of the lot.i love movie
and try to give them the benefit of the doubt ,
but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2. number 1
being demonicus.for those of you
who actually thought
this was a good movie ,
you are in serious need of ain surgery.most of the creature in the movie
were not even dragon ...
so why did they call d-war ?
