about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french door .
i thought
it sounded interesting enough
but i did not try to find it anywhere .
then about a year ago i remembered that film
and thought `` hey why not ''
and tried finding it on the internet .
eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom film .
i called my dad over to the computer
and said to him '' hey dad i have found
that creepy film you told me about age ago ! ''
he smiled at me ,
turned round turned off the light
so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen
and told me to watch it .
i started off fine ...
then
when he started getting worried about whatever was there
i
found it very unnerving .
at the end i pushed back my chair
and stood up ...
it made me jump !
:
p
if you have not seen this film i highly recommend you do
because it is well worth it .
even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.great film !
