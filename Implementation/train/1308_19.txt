i love this episode of columbo .
maybe it is because ruth gordon is in it
and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer abigail mitchell 
an american version of dame agatha christie .
she is delicious to watch as the perky 
lovable author
who suffered a terrible loss
when her niece died in a drowning accident .
she blames her niece 's husband 
the nephew .
she plans to kill him to avenge her death
since the police have abandoned her .
i would have loved somebody else than mariette hartley to play veronica .
i never really like hartley in anything personally .
and of course with columbo 
there are some laugh
like when he question veronica at a belly-dancing class .
ruth 's abigail is a smart sleuth herself
and she matches wit with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk .
