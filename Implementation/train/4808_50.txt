was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie ?
the character 
leon 
is funny enough
but shortly after that the sexual joke and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore .
some movie can get away with the sexual joke ,
and base their audience to know that right
when the advertising comes on .
some movie
that do this
are american pie and scary movie .
scary movie was stupid ,
and american pie would not have done well
without the sexual joke .
the only role 
besides leon 
that had some humor
that followed was will ferrell .
the character really was dumb
and that was all ,
the dumb humor was all
that had me watching .
the movie was ok ,
and nothing else .
i do not really understand
why the snl person
that are dying to leave the show
always get a movie
based on a character
they played on the show .
the skit last about 5 minute ,
and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit ,
then what is the world coming to ?
molly shannon had superstar ,
cheri o'terri had scary movie ,
but she was not a leading role ,
and will had elf .
but that was good ,
but he did some dumb movie ,
but i can not remember 
and mike myer with wayne 's world .
how come the mad tv crew do not ever get movie deal ?
seen only one guy eak through 
but only in like 2 movie and a tv show with andy dick .
but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue 
funny or not .
this movie is not good ,
but had some positive humor .
what a waste of film and person 's money .
