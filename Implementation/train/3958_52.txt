a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth .
( thing must be pretty bad back on mar . )
two state trooper investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash .
whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy 's pond
but there are footstep in the snow
leading to a nearby diner.the diner
has had no customer since eleven o'clock that morning .
now there are a handful of bus passenger
sitting around waiting for permission
to cross a structurally weak idge .
the bus driver insists
that six passenger were aboard the bus ,
although he did not notice
who they were .
the problem is that there are now seven person waiting for the journey to be resumed .
one of them is an alien ,
but which one ?
all of them are suspect .
there is the crazy old man
( jack elam ) ,
of course ,
who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit .
there is a blustering businessman
who must get to boston
( john hoyt ) .
a young couple on their honeymoon .
( execrable performance by the husband 
ron kipling . )
except for the couple 
nobody has noticed anyone else .
and even the couple are suspicious of each other .
bride to newly minted husband :
`` i could have sworn
you had a mole on your chin . ''
the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way
-- the phone ring for no reason 
the light go on and off ,
the juke box turns itself on --
and none of it is to be taken seriously.it is a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play
and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle .
there is no discernible `` depth '' to it .
it is not a moral message about pod person masquerading as normal citizen .
it is not a warning of any kind 
just a fairy tale
that diverts and amuses.i always enjoy it
when it is on .
it is especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman ,
knowing
that in 1954 he was the roman senator
who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm 's version of shakespeare 's play .
and here he is
-- with three arms.oop .
