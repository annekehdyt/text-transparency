russell 
my fav 
is gorgeous in this film .
but more than that 
the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow .
everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected .
the film makes the viewer realize
that tolerance of other human provides the route to saving humanity .
fabulous love story between lachlin and lil .
i replay their scene over and over again .
anyone
who has ever
been in love will empathize with these person .
all character are cast and portrayed excellently .
