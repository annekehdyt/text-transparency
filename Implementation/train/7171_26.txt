i saw this dull waste of time on hbo 's comedy channel 
so i quite innocently
and obviously assumed
that this was a comedy .
but there is absolutely nothing funny here .
a good cast is basically wasted on a script
that i could have written with my left butt-cheek -
after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century inquisition torturer .
the first half is particularly bad ,
as it has some of the most dull ,
pointless dialogue i have come across in a while 
and zero comma zero plot to speak of .
just the fact
that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta-jone are in this little movie
and yet this film has less than 1000 vote on this site ,
should tell you everything .
a couple of nice shot of wave
hitting the cold british coast ,
but that is about it.this is the sort of movie
that gets made just because the person
who wrote
it have good connection
( family connection 
preferably )
and/or plenty of cash
lying around .
