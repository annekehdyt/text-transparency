a fierce 
shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi
who wrote `` my beautiful laundrette '' ,
( this is the best thing
he is done since then ) .
it is about intelligent person
whose life do not add up to much .
they have squandered what they have been given
and are largely empty vessel .
the only character on screen
who is alive
is the mother of the title yet
she feels dead inside
until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex .
he has his own motive
but kureishi treat him with a good deal of compassion .
this is a film
in which person and place feel familiar ,
where character exist beyond the confine of the screen .
in some respect it is a bit like `` sunday 
bloody sunday ''
but it is an altogether tougher piece of work .
the director 
roger michell 
allows scene to build instinctively .
and it is beautifully acted.as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture .
there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance ,
and that very fine actor daniel craig display shading to his character
than even kureishi has not tapped into .
if the film strikes a false note
it is 
perhaps 
in the character of the talentless daughter 
caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduce
( or should
that be the other way round )
and even messier life ,
but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw
she hooks you in nevertheless .
the film is also extremely beautiful
to look at ( dop alwin kuchler )
and must rank 
unhesitatingly 
as the best british film of the year .
