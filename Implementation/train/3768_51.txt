it is a tale
that could have taken place anywhere really ,
given the right circumstance .
street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing .
the aging entertainer finds/buys a male child
to pass his art to .
from there 
we follow them through the rigor of their challenging ,
but free life along the river .
traveling town to town ,
he performs
and has some degree of notoriety .
despite the time and the influence ,
the man is kind and good.overall ,
the performance are first rate 
especially xu zhu ,
who portrays the street performer .
the child
( renying zhou )
is beautiful 
and downright strong ,
and withstands the overt prejudice well .
the two protagonist 
along with supporting help from the kind opera singer 
master liang
( an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang ) ,
paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness 
sadness and love .
some have mentioned this film 's remote similarity to ba wang bie ji
( farewell my concubine ) ;
yet this film can not stand easily on its own ,
any resemblance is remote at best.my only qualm with the king of mask ,
is the ending .
it was weak 
cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer .
the audience was already wrapped up in the story ,
what was the needless manipulation for ?
what a shame .
to ing a fine motion picture
that far 
only to surrender to emotional
( and corny )
pathos like that .
it frankly made this film good ,
instead of the classic 
it should have been .
that aside 
the king of mask is still very well worth your time .
i was happy to see
the shaw brother are still producing good film .
highly recommended .
