hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agency for their long commitment
to creating the best star trek story
and to providing an example of the togetherness
that was gene roddenberry 's mission .
their focus on homosexuality 
depression 
war 
and acceptance of different race is on par or exceed those of the other trek series and movie .
the production value started off as smaller and choppy
but over the 7 season of production
the acting has improved ,
the story are more complex ,
and the visual graphic have gotten smoother and more impressive .
in season 6 episode 1 
countermeasure 
there is one of the biggest space battle in trek history .
the ship are rendered well
and the space battle are impressive and exciting .
the real draw to frontier is not the ship or the background ,
but it is the person and the interplay and growth of character .
there are also nod to other trek series and movie with place and character
we all know .
i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasure
and you will be hooked !
