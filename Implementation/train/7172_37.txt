i thought
this was a very good movie .
it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sister
knowing about each liking the same boy
before he was killed off .
i am sure
if the movie had been done this way
there would have been a very different ending ,
that is why this made this move such a good movie .
it shows
that no matter what happens in your life with your sibling
that you can always get thru it
and that
if it is 2 sister dealing with a boy ,
( the same boy )
that
working thru the pain
and hurt makes thing to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them .
it is nice to see love story
that have a terrible thing to happen in someone 's life
that you can still get thru
it become even closer after its over .
i really enjoyed watching this movie ,
and i still do now
when it comes on .
i seem to find myself watching
it every time it comes on .
it would have been nice
if there would have been a part 2 for this movie ,
maybe
having the older sister to come up
and have his baby ,
this would really have made a great finish to the story
since he died 
this way
it would keep him alive
even though he is dead .
