the first was good and original .
i was a not bad horror/comedy movie .
so i heard a second one
was made and i had to watch it.what really makes this movie work is judd nelson 's character and the sometimes clever script .
a pretty good script for a person
who wrote the final destination film and the direction
was okay .
sometimes there is scene
where it looks like
it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.great made-for-tv movie .
it was worth the rental and probably worth
buying just to get
that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson 's stanley doing what he does best.i suggest newcomer to watch the first one
before watching the sequel ,
just so you will have an idea
what stanley is like and get a little history background .
