rarely do i see a film
that i am totally engrossed with ;
this was one of them .
it had good acting 
dialogue 
plot ,
and the scenery was beautiful .
i laughed out loud many time 
especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid .
the slapstick comedy
performed by the lunkhead hired hand
had me one the floor ,
but i admit
that i am a sucker for slapstick .
the story
dealt with a group of person in their 30 's coming back to a summer camp
that they had attended 20 year previously .
it was a farewell week of camping ,
as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season .
as adult the camp looked different ,
and they felt differently about it and each other .
i recommend this funny ,
moving movie to all .
