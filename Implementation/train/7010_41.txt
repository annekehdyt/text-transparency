i admit not being that fond of oliver !
as a young child
-- it is long ,
and the story is a little slow-moving
because of all the musical number .
as a teenager i discovered
that the fun of this movie is the experience itself .
rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist ,
think of it as a celeation of the classic story .
the adaptation is loose at best 
but really ,
if you are watching a musical ,
you are not there for the story.the music is the core of this movie ,
and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy .
most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical ,
and it shows in their performance
-- and i consider this a plus .
the performance are all in a more `` stagey '' style
of acting typical of much older film ,
and they are very entertaining .
the exception is the kid playing oliver ,
whose job seemed to be to look cute
and stay out of the real performer ' way.fagin
and the dodger are the real star of this movie .
oliver reed also does a fantastic job
maintaining an intimidating screen
presence as the menacing bill syke .
even syke ' dog bullseye puts on a good performance.this movie is not for everyone .
person
who hate musical
will despise it ,
as will those
who take musical too seriously .
nitpicking over faulty historical detail or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone 's enjoyment .
just sit back
and enjoy the entertainment
-- it is much better
if you remember that ,
as a musical 
it is a fantasy loosely organized around the book 
not a strict adaptation .
