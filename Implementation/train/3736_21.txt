i could not wait to get my hand on this one ,
when i read about fred astaire teaming up with george burn and gracie allen in a movie with a script by p.g .
wodehouse and music by the gershwin .
it is definitely worth seeing ,
but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred and ginger movie.the story would probably be better to read in a wodehouse book ,
where the humor comes across better .
some of the acting is downright painful to watch
( notably the young boy and the damsel )
.but ... !
the funhouse dance is worth more than most movie .
i never knew
that gracie allen could dance ,
but boy does she in this movie .
have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ?
imagine tapdancing on one in high heel !
she keeps up wonderfully with astaire
and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.several nice song ,
particularly fun are nice work
if you can get it and stiff upper lip.recommended for fan of astaire 
burn and allen .
i had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credit rolled .
