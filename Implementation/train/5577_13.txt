personally ,
i think
sayonara was the greatest movie
he ever made .
it touched every emotion from anger
to romance to complete tragedy .
and brando should have won for best actor .
anyway 
the movie is awesome ,
the man is attractive to both man and woman
and now you have no reason not to see it !
do so ,
and fall in love .
