i have made it my personal mission
to go after those responsible for this film .
i even got the rental company to give me my money back
because i argued
that they perpetrated false advertising.it is not enough
that the movie itself is a p.o.s. ,
but the cover art is what sold me .
i have done better make-up effect on my child at halloween
than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art .
can you say `` raccoon eye ?
`` i am not going to waste more of my time
by going into the full detail ,
but come on ,
the movie 's main character is an l.a. cop
who was born
and raised in alabama -
but has a german accent ! ? !
it is beyond insulting .
