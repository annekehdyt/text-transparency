using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaur this shot on video
( except for the stolen footage )
concerns a bunch of person shot into space
who land on a dinosaur planet
that is ... do not wait for it ,
is really earth .
its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minute .
slightly better than chickboxer
( another in the bad movie police series )
-having a nostalgic home movie feel
coupled with good stolen effect ,
this movie is still an impossible slog
to get through .
i am left
to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative
that we are now pillaging old movie not only for plot but also for mismatched footage ?
clearly low budget producer are getting so desperate
they really will give us anything to take our money
