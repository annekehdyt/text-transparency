i read jame hawes book .
it was pretty neat 
not great ,
but entertaining enough .
without having read the book i would not have had the slightest idea
what was going on ,
and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.literally every element of this film is abysmal in way
i do not have the capacity to describe .
half digested fish could have made a better film with matchstick and dayglo lipstick.never
before or since as a film made me feel so angry .
the mattress sequel came closest ,
but even they never reached such depth of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness
that this bilge did.since wasting 90 minute of my life
witnessing this plague on human kind i
am now unable to even look at any book by jame hawes
without feeling angry .
that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh*t. no ,
that is unfair .
let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil
that is rancid aluminium.plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema .
