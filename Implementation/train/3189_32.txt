i am a huge willem dafoe fan ,
and really sought out this film
( i had to get a region 5 chinese dvd of it ! ) .
but 
it is truly one of the worst
that i have seen in quite a while.the acting
( except for dafoe )
is horrible .
dafoe and colagrande both wrote and directed this
( though he is not credited as a director ) ,
and they have no discernible talent
for writing
or directing .
( stick to acting willem ;
giada get out of the business 
please !
) absolutely nothing happen .
except a series of completely unconvincing 
totally without believable motivation 
act by these two person
( that just met )
in this house .
colagrande 's sleepy 
i could not care less expression
practically never change .
and the sex scene are downright lame .
i actually cringed twice at one of them .
yuck !
they are definitely not the least bit erotic ,
and yet are the only time the film is not putting you to sleep .
then 
it is busy repulsing you.just awful .
