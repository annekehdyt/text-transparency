i realize
several ben stiller movie are out
or will be out this year ,
but perhaps he should insist on quality ,
not quantity.i was dumbfounded at what the filmmaker thought passed for comedy in `` along came polly . ''
stiller 's reuben is grating 
charmless and rank as one of the worst performance of the year .
stiller 's schtick is getting tiresome .
he undoubtedly has comic talent ,
but he needs to either find another schtick or take a eak ,
find some material
that is actually funny .
because his movie are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.there
is absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston ,
which is a shame
because she is a good ,
smart actress with a promising career .
as long as she keeps making more movie such as `` the good girl ''
( in which she is terrific )
and less like `` along came polly 
''
she will have a career
of which she could be proud.aniston try desperately
to overcome the limp material
with which she is working ,
but it is a daunting task for any actress .
with the exception of a few moment with alec baldwin 
as reuben 's boss stan 
and philip seymour hoffman 
as reuben 's best friend sandy 
there is nothing funny in this awful film .
other supporting character ,
including dea messing as lisa and hank azarium as claude ,
are annoying .
azarium 's accent is not only stupid ,
it is terribly unfunny.the premise of `` along came polly ''
certainly showed promise .
unfortunately 
it needed a writer
who could actually turn it into a good comedy ,
instead of this lame 
dull 
boring excuse for a comedy .
