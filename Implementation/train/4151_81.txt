visconti 's first feature 
ossessione is an adaptation of jame m. cain 's the postman always rings twice .
now 
i am not familiar with that book or the other film version ,
but i am a big fan of cain 's double indemnity
( much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder 's film version of it 
in fact ) .
the two novella seem like they must be very similar .
both involve an illicit love affair
where a ravenous wife complain to a morally weak man
that her husband is worthless and mean to her .
giovanna 
the woman in this italian version ,
played very well by clara calamai ,
is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity ,
but she seems very spoiled .
her husband
( a great performance by juan de landa )
is a bit cruel to her ,
but she strikes me like
she is at least as uncompromising with him .
he is older than her and unattractive ,
so she is rather fickle .
when gino shows up ,
a young 
muscular man ,
it takes her about five minute
to get him into bed .
she sweats she wants to be with him forever ,
but she is stuck with her husband .
they eak up at first ,
but when they meet again ,
they
( apparently ,
although this is intentionally vague )
plan to murder the husband .
they are successful ,
and they move back to the woman 's home town
to run the bar
that her husband owned .
gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea .
he wants giovanna 
but the one thing
that he certainly
does not want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life .
their relationship quickly crumble .
ossessione is a very complex film with complex character .
it is always fascinating ,
but it does go on a bit too long .
at two hour and twenty-two minute 
i can not 
for the life of me 
figure out
how it took that long !
this is partly due to the neorealist stylistic
that visconti was inventing within this film .
it was 
after all 
the first film
that won that label .
we see a lot of the action prolonged
as it would be in real life ,
without any hurrying to the next plot point .
i have seen many of visconti 's film ,
and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brother
( 1960 ) .
his direction is as great
as it ever was 
with the camera moving illiantly and the editing perfect .
i also feel the need
to point out the film 's best performance 
by dhia christiani as a young
( exotic )
dancer and part-time prostitute named anita
whom gino meet
after he begins to try to eak away from giovanna .
she is only in the film for maybe five or six minute ,
and she has only a few line .
it is shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time .
she is absolutely hearteaking .
9/10 .
