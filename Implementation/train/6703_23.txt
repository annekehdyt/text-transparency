watched both part twice .
enjoyed the story
and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero .
he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine
and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain .
i do admit
that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the `` lady in distress '' .
alison doody should stick with modern and not period piece .
she did not have the look of the woman of the 1800 's .
the rest of the cast were terrific
and followed the plotline very well .
i am glad to see
that the actor of this generation are not afraid to try on different character
and are not afraid to be seen
as getting older .
age is inevitable ,
but let 's not hide from it .
a man at 50+ can be much sexier
( and 
patrick truly is sexy )
then a green youth 
no matter how pretty .
hoorah for character line to go along with a great smile .
