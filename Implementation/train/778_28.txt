nothing
( 3+ outta 5 star )
another weird premise from the director of the movie `` cube '' .
this time around there are two main character
who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void .
there is literally nothing outside of their small two-story house .
intriguing to be sure ,
but i thought
the comedic tone established for this movie from the get-go was extremely ill-conceived .
there needs to be some humour ,
certainly ... and i have no problem with the humour
that was eventually derived from the plight of our two hero
( their final `` showdown '' was definitely a hoot ) ...
but i really think
the movie would have been a lot better off
if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning .
after watching the movie i watched the `` making of '' feature on the dvd
and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the `` sillier '' comedic aspect ...
making it look like a completely different
( and slightly better ) movie .
the last half hour of the movie is where thing really start to come together ... similar in a way to the recent movie `` primer . ''
the actor are fine
when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick .
they are really quite believable in their more `` normal '' moment .
i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point ...
but it won me over by the end .
( and keep watching past the credit for the final scene ...
just do not ask me to explain it . )
