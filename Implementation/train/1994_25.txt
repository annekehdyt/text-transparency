in watching how the two other interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area
much like they did in the movie .
i have watched this movie countless time
and have the book right beside my bible .
after watching the movie i agree
that this is one of the few movie
that does a book justice .
i strongly recommend anyone
that has the chance
to go to montana to fish
or be outdoor
to do so .
it is amazing .
i can not think of anyone else
that could play the role better than brad pitt .
do yourself justice
and watch one of the better movie in the modern movie era .
strongly recommend
and as a guide for fishing trip in both montana and wyoming ,
do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scene of the movie
because although it looks great on the film
you have no idea
how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes .
thank you for listening watch this movie please
if you would like a long sad movie .
