when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3
( zombie flesheater 2 in europe )
on an import region 2 japanese dvd 
i was blown away
by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.the transfer is just about immaculate ,
as good as it is ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it.the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.the sound is also terrific.it is only 2 channel dolby
but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 ,
you can really appreciate the cheesy music ( actually a very good score ) 
and the effective although cheap sound effect.it never sounded so good 
and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment.i never realized just how much blood flows in this film 
it is extremely utal with exploding head shot 
exploding puss filled mega pimple 
a cleaver to a zombie throat 
a woman 's burned off extremity ( how come it did'nt burn the guy also ) 
intestinal munching 
zombie baby and so much more i lost track.this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fan 
especially of the italian kind.there is some excellent set piece and cinematography to be found ,
i think person do not give it enough credit 
if you see a clean print 
and not some horrendous pirate copy 
it is a whole other experience entirely.this film never lets up for a second 
and i realize it is inconsistent plotwise 
the dubbing is horrible 
the acting is stiff ,
and it is sense of irreverence is celeated in grand fashion 
but that is part of it is charm.to me this is one of the best horror film ever made ,
you can not make a film this bad 
so good 
on purpose.it is accidental genius of the highest order.if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster ,
but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it is nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards.ton of action sequence 
exotic locale 
excellent set design 
good 
sometimes great cinematography 
wonderfully cheesy acting 
and inconsistent but still interesting plot 
great makeup effect 
beautiful woman
who can kick butt 
excellent music 
and sometimes hilarious 
sometimes creepy ,
but always entertaining zombie.how can you go wrong with this film ,
it has it all 
a cult classic
that stands the test of time .
