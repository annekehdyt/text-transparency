i do not know
why i am commenting this stupid reality-show i happened
to watch a few episode of ( a cable marathon oadcast
when they aired 5 episode in a row or something ,
i did not watch the entire thing though.only like three episode )
as i was nine month pregnant and about to go into labor any day.maybe i am just bored today :
- )
i feel sorry for britney ,
i really do.for all her money and fame
she seem to have very little sense of dignity.or
she is self-centered to the extreme.she married the nitwit federline
( okay anybody can make a mistake )
and before that she `` starred '' this horrible show about her everyday life with him ,
where she shoves a camcorder wherever
she feels like it ,
no matter
if it is in someone 's face or into the shower
as federline is standing in there .
she is babbling about her sex-life
without leaving anything
to your imagination ,
i do not care for my part ,
but i can not help wondering
how she feels about it now
when she is divorced.and yes ,
for her sake i am embarrassed.but i should not be.she seem to live a pretty empty ,
shallow life though.i do not want to swap life with her even if i could .
road-kill tv
if you like .
