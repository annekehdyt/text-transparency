anyone
who does not laugh all through this movie
has been embalmed .
i have watched it at least twenty time
and i still get tear in my eye at many of the scene .
sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert 
a fading soap star
whose supporting cast
is trying to get her replaced in hope
that their own star will rise .
field 
at 45 
still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure
that belies her having had three child .
i am biased ,
i am in love with her.the cast of `` soapdish ''
is filled with star
who perform their role to perfection .
kevin kline is flawless ,
as are robert downey jr. 
an ing\u00e9nue elizabeth shue 
whoopi goldberg 
teri hatcher in one of her early role 
carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director
who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter
without his shirt on .
kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer 
and best of all 
cathy moriarty as nurse nan
who leads the plot
to get field character
removed from the show
is hilarious.this movie
should have won oscar for best comedy 
best leading lady in a comedy 
best leading man in a comedy and myriad other best ,
including writing ,
directing and supporting actor and actress .
get the dvd
so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five year .
you will still be laughing at it
when the disc wears out .
