this movie will promote the improvement of the mind .
read a book !
it is incredible
anyone
would think
this movie deserved the time and investment to make .
i have seen `` b '' movie
before but the `` c '' movie has just been invented .
i did not think
i would ever enjoy power ranger
since my kid stopped watching
but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minute into `` knight . ''
high school production are better
than this and the actor involved should erase this from their resume .
embarrassment is one of many description
that come to mind .
my roommate ,
who loves these type of movie
even turned it off .
now that has to really tell you something .
if you watch this movie ,
and like it 
i will pray for you .
