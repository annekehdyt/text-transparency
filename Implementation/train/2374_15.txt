i am a big fan of the old western ,
and do not believe
that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory .
but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this 1957 movie
which carries nearly all the trite characteristic of western of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy .
fallen but virtuous woman 
bigoted townspeople
who must turn to gunfighter for salvation 
etc .
i can not help but notice the last name of the writer and young `` actor ''
who play granger 's son .
any nepotism there ?
i have seen better acting in high school play .
chill will play a cartoon characterization of chill will .
have i reached the 1000 word yet ?
