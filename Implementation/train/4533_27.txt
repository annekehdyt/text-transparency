taking a eak from his escapist run in the early '80 ,
steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walker 's `` the color purple '' 
about about the desperate existence of an african-american woman in the 1930s .
watching goldberg play celie ,
it is incredible
that this is the same woman
who starred in movie like `` sister act '' .
this is the sort of movie
that could easily be - no ,
make
that should be - part of the curriculum in black study and woman 's study .
there is one scene
that may be the most magnificent editing job
that is ever been on screen
( you will know it
when you see it ) .
i can not believe
that this did not win a single oscar ;
it may be spielberg 's second best movie behind `` schindler 's list ''
( maybe even tied with it ) .
also starring danny glover 
adolph caesar 
margaret avery 
oprah winfrey 
willard e. pugh 
akosua busia 
and laurence fishburne .
