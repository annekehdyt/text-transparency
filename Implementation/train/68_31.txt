'what i like about you ' is definitely a show
that i could not wait to see each day .
amanda byne is such an excellent actress
and i grew up watching her show :
'the amanda show . '
she is a very funny person
and seems to be down to earth .
`` holly '' is such a like-able person
and has an `` out-there '' personality .
i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn thing around and upside down ,
so she messed herself up at time .
but that is what made the show
so great.i especially loved the show
when the character 'vince ' came along .
nick zano is very hot and funny 
as well as 'gary ' 
wesley jonathan .
the whole cast was great ,
each character had their own personality and charm .
jennie garth 
allison munn 
and leslie grossman were all very interesting .
i especially loved 'lauren ' ;
she is the best !
she helped make the show extra funny
and you never know
what she is gon na do or say next !
overall the show is really nice
but the reason i did not give it a 10 was
because there is no more new episode
and because the episode could have been longer and more deep .
