on the surface the idea of oman 4 was good .
it is nice to see
that the devil child could be a girl .
in fact 
sometimes 
as in the exorcist ,
when girl are possessed or are devilry
it is very effective .
but in oman 4 
it stunk.delia does not make me think
that she could be a devil child ,
rather she is a child with issue .
issue
that maybe only a therapist ,
rather then a priest could help .
she does not look scary or devilish .
rather 
she looks sulky
and moody.this film had potential
and if it was made by the same person
who had made the previous three film
it could of worked .
but it is rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogy ,
as a made for tv movie special.on so many level
it lets down .
it is cheap looking ,
the acting is hammish
and the effect are typical of a tv drama .
the character do not ing any sympathy ,
and you do not route for them .
i recently re-watched it
after someone ought it for me for christmas ,
and it has dated appalling.if your thinking of watching this ,
then i would suggest
that you do not .
watch one of the other 
or watch the exorcist 
or watch the good son .
just do not waste your time on this drivel !
