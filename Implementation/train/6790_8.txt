doctor feinstone is a dentist.he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool.suddenly he discovers
that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realise
that behind everything clean ,
there is decay.he start to torture his patient ...
corbin bernsen is illiant
as the deranged dentist-he is completely believable.there is surprisingly little gore
but the scene of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque.highly recommended .
`` the dentist 2 '' is also worth checking out !
