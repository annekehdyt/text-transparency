this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot ,
and is positive proof
that a five minute fable does not a full-length film make .
poor sid caesar as the vain emperor 
is made to look so stupid ,
it is hard to watch him .
as the sly tailor 
robert morse has not an ounce of charm .
neither does his hapless nephew
( jason carter )
the `` song '' are dreadful
and only slow what there is of the plot down .
the direction is practically nonexistent ,
and the supporting character add very little .
lysette anthony is pretty as the emperor 's daughter ,
but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason 
a fate
shared by many of the minor player .
and the film crawls at a snails pace .
han christian andersen must have been turning somersault in his grave
when this appeared .
it can honestly be said ,
at least of this movie tale 
it is no surprise
that it went straight to video oblivion .
