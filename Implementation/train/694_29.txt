gender bender the limerick :
a man or a woman ?
who knows ?
it turns out
that 'it ' is both.sleeping in claythen
they all went awayin one of their ufos.gender bender
is another great season 1 episode .
i enjoy this one
because the story is the kind
where
you are
never really sure
what is gon na happen next .
it is entirely original .
the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco light .
i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does .
i really like the atmosphere at the kindred 's little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night .
its very exciting .
this is one of my favorite season 1 episode in fact .
i think
the thing i like about it so much is how
they turn out to be alien in the end and left crop circle .
many person see this as a non-mythology related alien episode kind of like `` the unnatural '' or `` space ''
but i think
this could easily be seen as mythology related .
maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter
and could appear to look like anyone .
huh ?
anyway i give the episode a 9/10 .
