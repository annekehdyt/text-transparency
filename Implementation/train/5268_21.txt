generally i do not like film
directed by sydney pollack
( `` the firm '' being somewhat of an exception )
and i have never been a robert redford fan either .
still 
i thought
`` three day of the condor '' must be good
because of the number of praising comment
it has received.although the widescreen cinematography
is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer ,
i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing .
the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere ,
but everything is ruined by the muddled plot
which does not seem to make any sense.the film
also contains one of the most unsatisfying
ending i
have ever seen
which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air .
and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway ?
i would much rather watch any of hitchcock 's film five time in succession
than to sit through this piece of waste once more .
