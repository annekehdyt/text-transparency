kurt russell is so believable and the action so non-stop
that it takes thinking about it afterward
to realize
that there were honest-to-goodness important theme [ overcoming fear of the stranger ,
learning to rise above early conditioning 
the strength
that love and friendship can ing 
etc . ]
in the storyline .
this is so very rare for a 'guy 's action flick '
that even i [
who thinks
most a/a is violent pap ] liked the film
and have recommended it to every guy i know
... ..it is a shame
this one was overlooked
because by right it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hit
-- it has something for everyone
without straining credulity
or losing the nearly non-stop action moment .
i am afraid the answer
to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact
that adult did not go to see it .
anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video game
but probably would either not catch the multi-layered 
multi-themed beauty or not care about it .
this film could convert anyone
who avoids a/a as mindless violence .
if a guy takes his lady [ or rents
it or sees it in a cable listing ] to see this film
he will be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flick .
