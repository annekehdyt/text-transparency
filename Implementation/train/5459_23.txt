alex winter and keanu reeve return as the two dope from san dimas
who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future
feels
exactly the opposite the way
it was presented in the first movie.the only difference
is that their trip is `` somewhere '' between heaven and hell
and ends up being both .
when they meet the grim reaper ,
they get the chance of an after-lifetime
to play him for a chance to return
and stop two evil robot from ruining what future they were supposed to have .
besides playing role
they have ... er ... perfected ,
they also play
( and revive a couple of extra sale in the process )
some classic game
( i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet )
.the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with `` what it might be like ''
instead of `` what was . ''
without spoiling the movie ,
i can not give you anymore information about this
( i guess you will just have to watch them both and decide for yourself !
8/10 star .
