this fantastic whodunit is an early prototype
of what soon became a very popular film genre .
i was happy to see william powell
handling a detective story with charisma and charm ,
and without the silly attitude of his nick charle character
( from the `` thin man '' series ) .
while the story is good on its own ,
i think
what really makes this movie fun to watch
is michael curtiz ' fantastically imaginative direction .
from a visual point of view 
this is a richly textured movie 
with curtiz
showing an incredible command of the medium ;
from split screen image ,
to weird camera angle and imaginative flashback ,
curtiz demonstrates
that he was one of the best hollywood director .
highly recommended
if you are fan of this type of movie .
