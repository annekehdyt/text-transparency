what is with indoneian musical movie ?
never have i seen indoneian musical movie like the one
made in bollywood .
they miss the spirit of the story
and just a bunch of 'what
they called ' poetic line.this story about love of two kid
who are separated
and then meet again
after a few year of change has no special remark .
it is a simple story plot
( but it is quite focused though )
with 'meant to be ' musical story line here and there.confusing character
that should be saved by illiant acting
are neglected .
the main actress may try to live up the character ,
but it is the best
that she could do 
trying .
as for the casting 
i do not feel the necessity
to put a balinee student in that story and of course ,
that is not the only unnecessary character.the strange thing is ,
why would i want to watch this movie ?
maybe because of the mango ...
