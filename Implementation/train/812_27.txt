anyone
who thinks
this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius
must have been smoking with the two stoner in the film .
this film is not under-rated ...
it is a bad movie .
there should be no comparison between this film and the naked gun or airplane
since the latter two film are well written and funny .
class reunion is neither of those thing .
the sad thing is it had such potential
( good cast 
good story line )
but the good joke are few and far between .
the scene
that were supposed to be funny
came off more annoying than amusing .
the stoner guy 
the vampire 
the blind girl ... not funny .
the only funny character were delore
( the one
who sold her soul to the devil )
.national lampoon has made some really good film
( animal house 
vacation )
but this is not one of them .
i certainly expected more from john hughe .
