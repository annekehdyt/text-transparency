not only does this movie have a poor plot 
bad direction ,
and terrible acting ,
its opens up a whole new meaning to racism.in this film `` white '' chick are the slut ,
`` white '' boy are the wana-be gangster ,
and successful
( yes again )
`` white '' businessman are revolting toilet shitters.i
just wonder what would happen
if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script ,
only i made it about caucasian .
`` he dude 
its good
to finally see your 've stopped dating those black chick '' .nobody seems to notice it ,
but watch this film again
and you will vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand `` white boy '' .
all of a sudden its white folk
who are the main cause of gang aggression ,
and whores out for a quick bang .
only samoan girl have a heart ,
there is no such thing as a non-slutty white girl.it disgust me
that they could not make this film
without giving the caucasian community in new zealand a repulsive profile .
if you think
i am overgeneralizing ,
go watch this film ,
and see what you make of the `` white boy '' .
just because samoan choose to call us `` white boy '' in actual life ,
does not mean its funny .
if i said
hey black boy i will loose my teeth.do not see this movie .
do not waste your money .
do not be racist .
