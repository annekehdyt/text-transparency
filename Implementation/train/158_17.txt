i went to see fever pitch with my mom ,
and i can say
that we both loved it .
it was not the typical romantic comedy
where someone is pining for the other ,
and blah blah blah ... you were not waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them
to finally get together .
it was more real ,
because you saw them through the relationship ,
rather than the whole movie be about them getting together .
person could actually relate to the film ,
because it did not seem like extraordinary circumstance 
or impossible situation .
it was really funny ,
and i think
it was jimmy fallon 's best performance .
all in all ... i would definitely recommend it !
