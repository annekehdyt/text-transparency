i watched the film recently
and it poorly resembles
the book is based on .
i blame this on poor screenplay and direction .
some part were forcibly introduced
( the gay rape scene )
for no apparent reason .
i actually read the book
after watching the movie and some 20 year or so
after reading it for the first time .
i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy .
too many disparate idea introduced for no benefit at all ... other than sensational part for the time .
as it covers stuff
that was deemed 'sensitive ' ,
to say the least 
during communism 
i can see the fascination it produced at the time .
that is not the case anymore
though or maybe i see thing differently now or a bit of both .
the film tries too much to cover many aspect from the book ,
the result being a concoction of scene
that may make some sense to someone
who read the book .
even so this is a film
that is difficult to watch and maybe should
have never been made .
