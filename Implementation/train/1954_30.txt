shamefully ,
before i saw this film ,
i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter.i had to do some research ,
in order to assure myself she was not actually afflicted ,
as was her character 
with ( well ?
) 
what she was afflicted with .
i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady .
she pulled
it of flawlessly.who would have thought
that sexually explicit circumstance
involving the final wants ,
and need 
of a unique young lady ,
could be interpreted as tender 
and romantic ?
well 
they can be ,
when the right performer present them in the proper manner ,
as they did in this wonderful movie .
i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie .
i have often said
she was the most beautiful creature
to have ever graced the face of our earth ,
but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.i hope any of you
who watch this movie
enjoy it as much
as i did .
thank you for letting me express my opinion .
