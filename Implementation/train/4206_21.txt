the only reason
to give this movie even a single star
is how much the ending made me laugh .
i had high hope as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movie ,
but this just did not qualify .
it is really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity ,
which again ,
is not a bad plot ,
but is done poorly here .
there are some scene
( such as the ending )
which are not intended to be funny ,
but actually made me laugh out loud .
there were a couple of time
when i thought
the movie would actually go in an interesting direction ,
but it never fulfills what it could and should be .
in my opinion ,
if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick ,
try silent night 
deadly night .
