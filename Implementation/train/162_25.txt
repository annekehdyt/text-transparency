i am
probably one of the biggest nancy drew fan out there .
i have read every book three time
over and i have played a lot of the nancy drew game .
i loved this movie .
it kept you entertained the whole time you watched it .
i went with about 10 of my friend
and everyone loved it .
there were three woman
sitting behind us
who appeared to be in their late 30 's to early 40 's and i asked them
how they liked it ,
they said
they loved it !
so you see
it will be an entertainment to all age .
you just have to give it a chance .
and it teaches a lesson too ,
just be yourself
even if everyone around you is exactly alike .
so overall 
this move was great .
i am going to see it a second time now !
so stop bashing it please .
its a really good movie !
