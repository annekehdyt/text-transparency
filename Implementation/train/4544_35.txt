sure 
65 year have passed
since thalberg 's last production was filmed .
but fellow imdb member 
come on ,
this movie is surely one of the masterpiece of the 30 's !
it is a 10.this was the first movie i saw at new york 's museum of modern art 
around 1970
( i was a teenager ) .
expensive looking yet with scene of such poverty 
masterfully photographed 
often thrilling ,
and always engaging ,
to me it was mgm movie-making at its best .
what did audience feel
when they glimpsed a locust attack 
the person by person destruction of a mansion 
the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth.last week ,
those
watching the academy award
had a glimpse of the `` senior '' oscar winner in attendance 
luise rainer .
how grand to see an actress
who arguably delivered one of the most masterful 
haunting performance in history electing to return for a celeation.ok ,
so she should not have won the year
before
( great ziegfeld ) ,
but do not blame luise .
talky were only a decade old
when this was released ,
and her dialogue limited .
but as olan 
her use of visual and vocal is memorable.large scale and touching ,
what more could a movie lover want !
