good actor and good performance can not mask a pointless script 
bad dialogue ,
and pattern of behavior spiraling into nothing
you would care about .
the most interesting character is david berkowitz .
no character development - no growth 
no interest 
just some suffering for no particular reason ,
teaching us nothing
and not even bothering to entertain .
