what a waste of time and money !
my hubby and i saw this movie -
after seeing the preview
and thinking
it `` might be funny '' .
wrong !
this movie is about 90 minute too long .
the actor are trapped in a poorly written script
and can not get out .
the joke are weak and tired ,
and not even seeing wilson 's naked behind can redeem any part of this film .
the special effect ... ..are not .
i half expected to see the harness and wire holding up uma in her flying scene .
and when the effect person apparently could not master the superhero 's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet flying or fight scene ,
they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen -
which hid the awful effect quite nicely .
wilson 's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man
and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co-worker .
the sex scene were not sexy
and the funny scene were not funny .
i guess
i just expected too much from these actor .
none of the character were really sympathetic ,
so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them .
the only memorable performance were the kid
who played bedlam and g-girl as teenager -
at least they had some chemistry .
overall 
a super stinko movie - i would not even recommend it as a rental -
it would still be a waste of money !
