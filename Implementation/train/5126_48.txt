australia 's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang .
and a stab .
and a slice .
and a scream or two .
and plenty of blood 
fright 
red herring and lot of laugh.in fact 
there is lot of first surrounding cut -
it is the first script of dave warner 's to be produced ,
although he has several other either optioned or in negotiation ;
it is the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall ;
and it is also the first film for producer martin fabinyi .
and for a bunch of guy dipping their to into this genre for the first time ,
they sure know
their stuff.cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film student
who hear about a slasher film 
hot blooded ,
that was never finished
because its director 
hilary
( kylie minogue ) ,
was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film.despite their lecturer
( who was assistant director on the night hilary died )
warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dy 
director raffy
( jessica napier )
and producer hester
( sarah kant )
decide to go ahead and complete the film .
they put together a crew
and manage to get the original star 
vanessa turnbill
( molly ringwald ) ,
to return to australia - in fact 
to the original location -
to complete hot blooded 14 year
after shooting shut down.of course ,
this being a slasher film 
lot of bloodletting ensue long with plenty of laugh 
a few good scare and a rocking aussie soundtrack .
cut shows
that australia can make a good ,
mass-market horror film just as well
as hollywood.it is a finely crafted feature 
with excellent special effect 
a taut plot and a killer - scarman -
that is a welcome addition to the rank of michael 
jason and freddy .
