what an utter disappointment !
the score of 6,1 here on imdb built up some mild expectation
but 
oh my 
was i disappointed .
the first thing
that bugs me
are those aindead 
stereotyped university kid .
yes 
i know
teen can be childish and so on ,
but why are they in movie always portrayed as complete aindead moron ?
there was one character
that
i thought was alright 
but he/she
( not revealing it here )
was killed off way before the end .
the other character was poorly executed
and even the supposed hero/heroine just did not do it for me .
on the plus side :
the plot is pretty good
and the production values a cut above for these kind of flick .
the acting was generally not very good ,
rutger hauer stands out in a small role .
but it all fails with bland and aindead character .
you just stop caring about them after 10 minute .
4/10
( and that being generous ) .
