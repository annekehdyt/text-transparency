i 
also having endured hundred of child 's movie in the past ,
consider this to be one of the worst i
have ever seen.1 )
i resent in this day and age
having to explain to my child
that russia is not `` the bad guy '' .
also ,
that mocking russian name like `` poopchev '' is inappropriate.2 )
the grandfather fly 's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke
in which he implied
that male drink beer and woman talk on the phone .
two other fly also needlessly use the word `` crap '' twice.3 )
the whole movie largely smack of 1950 's stereotype and propaganda
that i thought
we ,
as a nation 
were proud to have risen above.in
all it is just crude 
badly animated 
even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view .
