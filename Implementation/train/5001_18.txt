`` what would you do ? ''
is a question
that will stick in your mind for week
after watching the emotional brokedown palace .
you will also be left wondering if alice
( dane )
was telling the truth or not - a issue
that is left unresolved 
and rightly so .
this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film .
although it is slow at time ,
its pace is reflective of the story line -
but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat ;
wanting to know what happens next .
the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoe of the lead character ,
which are illiantly played by kate beckinsale and claire dane .
bill pullman 's performance is commendable 
too .
