in 1993 
`` the visitor '' was an enormous hit in france .
so 
the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately 
this sequence ranks among the worst one ever made .
this is a movie
that does not keep its promise .
indeed 
it is supposed to tell a sole story .
jean reno must go in the twentieth century
and take christian clavier back in the middle age
so that time can normally follow its course .
the problem is that clavier feel completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century ,
and so make him get back in the middle age
is rather hard ... instead of this ,
the movie goes on several other story
without succeeding
in following the main plot .
as a consequence 
the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed ,
sometimes a bit of a mess.but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actor .
reno and clavier fall into the trap
that however they could avoid in the first movie :
they are going over the top and become annoying .
then 
why did jean-marie poir\u00e9 the film-maker engage muriel robin in the female main role ?
he made a mistake
because she seems ill-at-ease
and is absolutely pitiful .
the other actor are not better :
marie-anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau 
unbearable .
of course 
the movie contains a few good moment with efficient gag
but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness .
certain sequence and dialog are affected .
it also appears hollow
because poir\u00e9 takes back element
that secured the success of the first movie .
thus 
a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family
and asks him to take part in her wedding.a labored and disappointing follow-up .
anyway 
what is the interest of this movie otherwise commercial ?
