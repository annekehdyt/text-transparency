a lot of the user comment i have seen on the imdb for this movie do
not really do it justice .
first of all 
let me just say
that this movie is not to be taken seriously .
it is supposed to be a fun 
yet stupid movie ,
that does not require one to think ,
only to enjoy it .
if you watch this movie with the intent
to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour ,
then you will be sorely disappointed .
yet ,
if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors/actress 
and some good catch-phrase ,
then you will enjoy it .
