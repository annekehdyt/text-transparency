a plot
that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable difference in opinion constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon 's seed .
the horror was left out
and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific 
but 
instead demonstrated an ill dose of belief
which ridiculed each other to death ,
despite the title itself .
being a fan of master of horror since the beginning ,
this ridiculous plot twist
with it is sordid depiction crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair
after being sat upon .
i view this episode
as being thrown together from the get go ,
never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved
when it finally came to `` the end '' ..
