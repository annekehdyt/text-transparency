i read about this movie in a magazine and i
was intrigued .
a woman ,
who one day sees herself drive past in her own car .
well 
i thought 
this could be interesting ... ...
but it is not .
first 
the title .
the broken ?
the broken ... what ?
what is oken ?
the ... oh ,
wait ... i get it ,
the title itself is `` oken '' !
wow 
clever !
unfortunately 
this is virtually the only thing
going for it.the premise is not that bad ,
but i think
kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirror ' .
a cross between invasion of the body snatcher and mirror ,
and a rather mediocre one at that .
a more suited title would be 'the boring ' ,
since it draws out every single scene for bloody age .
or maybe 'the confusing ' since it does not explain anything at all 
not in the narrative nor in the story itself 
only some vague idea about evil copy and somesuch 
dotted with cheap scare and scene
used to death ,
but nothing tangible .
it is just messed up.on the other hand ,
the acting and the special effect are quite good ,
but then again ,
it is not a difficult role to act.after
watching the movie twice ,
i still feel unsatisfied 
a little confused maybe 
and not in the e. a. poe or stephen king kind of way .
do yourself a favor ,
and do not watch this one .
simply put ,
there are better thriller out there .
