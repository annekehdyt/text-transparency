i have seen this film several time in a variety of short-film festival
and it always causes me the impression
that i have seen a movie trailer !
for a school-film is very well produced and directed ,
but the story ... well
it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film .
the character
named tim watcher
needed some in-dept approach .
this is something
that lacks in some portuguese short film -
the script is always superficial.but
still ... i liked this movie ... parabens !
( congratulation ! )
