after the reasonably successful masti
which was tad better inder kumar
returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan
based on the hollywood film
see no evil ,
hear no evil the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke
( 1994 )
where kader and anupam play the blind and deafthis movie is a tedious exercisethe film has joke of such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like snehal dabi 's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedy
which we do not laugh at now but mock the film starts off in a clich\u00e9d manner and some scene are funny sadly such moment do not last long
as the story never moves in this half
even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled
and the second half becomes an action film
where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroine
and we have all ott chase scene and fight scenedirection by inder kumar is bad music is okay 
one song stands out i love
you my angelvivek is awful in the comic scene ,
his timing is very bad
and is okay in serious scene for some reason
he keeps
doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst
the rest esha and amrita are the heroine boman irani annoy here
snehal dabbi is okay
