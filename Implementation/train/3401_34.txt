hey everyone ... there really is not much to say for this movie at all .
the basic plot is that a guy
( brandon )
takes a few friend on a trip to his cabin in the wood for a weekend holiday away from work .
after picking up a girl on the way there ,
thing start going badly wrong for all of them.the storyline alone
( written by the actor playing brandon ,
i believe ,
although i could be wrong here )
is unlikely and unconvincing ,
and is acted out accordingly .
the `` clown killer '' himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer .
far from being a dark ,
mysterious but most of all 
intelligent predator 
we are instead offered a rather clumsy 
nursery rhyme-singing buffoon
who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis .
the only thing
that warranted the writing of this comment
were the sex scene and whatever gore
there was in the film
( the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such thing )
.in short 
this film falls below every possible set standard .
admittedly 
i was sharing a few beer with a close friend as i watched this ,
so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film
and it is therefore only fair to mention
that s.i.c.k did fall just shy of a two rating .
however 
in reality ,
( and with the benefit of hindsight )
the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.1 star out of ten .
