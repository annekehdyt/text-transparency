soylent green is ... a really good movie ,
actually.i never would 've thought it .
i do not really like heston in his sci-fi effort .
he is one of those actor
who 
like superman 
manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time .
i prefer more vulnerable hero .
and indeed 
he sneers his way through much of soylent green 
too ,
but as he is supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i do not really mind.i can understand
why some person would turn their nose up at this movie .
soylent green makes no effort whatsoever
to create futuristic visual
( what do you know -
it looks just like 1973 ) ,
and it is lacking in action .
but i admired the film 's vision of a complex 
corrupt 
and highly stratified society ,
and i was so pleased to see
that edward g. robinson had such a moving ,
funny final role .
nice little character moment -
like when he share some precious food with heston -
really make the movie.the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these day ,
when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporation are up to .
funny 
is not it ,
to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie ...
