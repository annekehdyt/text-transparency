disjointed 
unclear 
bad screenplay 
poor photography and direction ...
all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good person at tbn.tbn picture has had great success in the past
by helping to ing `` china cry '' 
the story of nora lam 
to the big screen .
but `` the omega code '' is an unfortunate miscue .
as a christian
who supports tbn and a lot of its programming
and who loved `` china cry '' ,
i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone .
they do much good with their ministry ,
but this is not an example of it .
do not waste your money ... go rent
`` china cry '' instead .
