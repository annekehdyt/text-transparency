lost is one of a kind ... its so enchanting and full of suspense 
thrill and emotion all at the same time.i have never seen any tv series like this before .
it is full of jungle thrill
and has a good screenplay .
the actor have emoted life on an island in such a natural way
that i feel
lost in the island
myself
while watching it.it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form.the series is like a movie
depicting the life of the survivor lost on a deserted island.i am
tempted to watch one episode
after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers.watch it to see the magic
of being lost in nowhere .
