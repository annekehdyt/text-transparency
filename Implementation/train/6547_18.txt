and one feels the pain 
sorrow and joy of the person
who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez.one
comes away from viewing this film
that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure .
hugo chavez 's persona single-handedly ought the venezuelan person
to overthrow the 3-day old military-installed junta
and re-establish the democratically installed government of venezuela.it is obvious from the film footage
that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat .
that the mainstream medium aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising.what is surprising is how few person has seen this movie
and how few person realize
the total corruption of america 's mass medium.it has taken only 20 year for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986
