bingo is the game ,
bullshit is the name .
rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown-up hodgepodge of half-baked conspiracy theory 
puritan prudery 
and new-age gibberish .
the bulk of the story is set at viciente 
a cristian resort in the peruvian jungle .
think
tolkien 's rivendell meet star trek 's planet baku 
inhabited by dimwitted follower of a not-so-mysterious ,
but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace .
thank to gruesome acting and tacky production design
( the rainbow-colored visualization of the mysterious all-healing `` energy '' is particularly hideous ) ,
`` the celestine prophecy '' look
and feel like a discarded 1980s `` twilight zone '' episode .
factual error
regarding church history and nomenclature abound .
i can not believe
hector elizondo agreed to be a part of this .
maybe it was made without his consent 
bowfinger style .
may the lord have mercy on the director 
the screenwriter 
the author of the novel 
and the poor soul
who see the movie
or read the book .
