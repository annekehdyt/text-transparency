i have to be completely honest in saying
first
that i fell asleep somewhere in the middle ,
so i can not give a full opinion about the film
until i see it in full .
basically 
a group of thieve ,
including sid carter
( sid jame )
and ernie bragg
( bernard bresslaw ) ,
plan to make a fortune stealing a shipment of contraceptive pill from finisham maternity hospital .
this is where title character matron
( hattie jacque )
work 
along with staff member sir bernard cutting
( kenneth williams ) ,
dr. francis goode
( charle hawtrey ) ,
dr. prodd
( terry scott )
and nurse susan ball
( barbara windsor ) .
patient and their visitor are around too ,
including pregnant mrs. tidey
( joan sim )
and her nervous dad-to-be husband mr. tidey
( kenneth connor ) .
also starring bill maynard as freddy and eastender ' wendy richard
as miss willing .
this plan by the way is not working out by the way ,
because all the staff are getting in the way .
that is pretty much all can say about the film until i see it again in full .
okay !
