the us state dept .
would not like us to see this movie ,
because they have a beef with the iranian govt .
however 
it shows us
just how civilized iran really is ,
despite the content of the film ,
which centers on the struggle of woman there for equal right in the simplest of term :
the ability
to watch a soccer game at the stadium ,
which is strictly limited to male audience alone .
the film is hilariously funny ,
and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran .
i enjoyed this movie intensely .
five girl try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain .
the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe 
from the bus trip to the stadium 
to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girl 
to the resulting end .
do not miss this classic film .
its a must see .
one of the best foreign film i have seen in year .
