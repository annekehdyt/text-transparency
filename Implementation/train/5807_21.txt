this movie 's full title is `` waqt :
race against time '' .
that is a race no one can ever win ,
but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious `` waqt '' on this bakvaas .
this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way
that made k3g look honest .
it strained my credulity too far .
it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline ,
and deserves to be mocked for it.it is not quite as awful as baghban or black ,
but this movie has nothing to recommend it .
stupid 
pointless 
with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji .
the central `` plot '' is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda
that infests so many `` family '' bw film .
if my father ,
who raised me ,
and who i love dearly ,
treated me like big b did akshay ,
i would shoot him myself .
to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness .
