this movie has a very broadway feel
- the backdrop 
the acting 
the 'noise'-
and yet that is all it has .
some 'sense ' of a broadway
without the bang .
the movie is slow-paced 
the picture disjointed 
the singing 'pops up ' on you
so
that
you suddenly
are reminded
it is a musical .
disappointing :
sinatra intolerable :
sinatra 's fianc\u00e9
-- -surely 
the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary .
tolerable :
mr `` i remember the number on my dice '' delight :
brando 's understated singing
( very biased !
) surprise :
how much jean simmon looks like vivien leigh in her havana scene .
it is the bone structure !
how i would 've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again .
