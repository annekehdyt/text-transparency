i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop 's .
and this one surely is an oop .
one year after the exorcist she is back in business with this movie
but what we all new was that the career of blair never oke out ,
she never became a mega star .
that is one of the reason
's many of her film are oop .
she gives a good performance in this movie .
it is about a reject
not recognized by her parent
and does not have any friend .
played at an age of 15
playing a girl of 14 ,
that is funny .
the movie is also known for the rape scene in the shower were they stick a oomstick up her virginity .
in most edition it is cut out 
why ,
i do not know ,
no blood is involved 
okay ,
blair is butt naked
but nothing is shown ,
no tanda so nothing to offend person .
but the movie is slow 
extremely slow .
it does not happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep .
it is just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows 
no gore no nothing .
why this is categorized in horror
is still a wonder to me .
if you are a fan of blair ,
buy it
if you can find
it otherwise leave it
as it is .
