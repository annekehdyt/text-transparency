this might contain a spoiler ,
so beware.if it had been 200,000 thousand or two million person ,
does it make a difference ?
sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number
of ( strangely very loud ) american ,
but i have to remember
that many person here in the us were not ed or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone .
god help us for what we have done .
after the relative ease of what we did to the native american ,
and the indifference to the horror of enslaving a race ,
you would think
we 'd have grown heart and soul in the late 60 's and early 70 's .
but now i see it is ok as long as our end are justified to only us .
how then 
can we look at any other dictator and horrible governmant
and think
we are somehow doing good to impose our will ?
we are contradictory and hypocritical ,
and i am ashamed for this .
i feel sorrow for the person affected .
they deserve justice and their home back .
if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety ,
i do not want it .
i denounce these action ,
and hope our global community understands
that many american believe
the american governmant is a runaway train of deceit .
no one is above the law .
i want my country back ,
and so do the chagos islander .
regardless of what person post from the anonymity of their computer ,
no one can in their heart deny
that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bomb and heliport .
we can not stand to be stuck in traffic ,
let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our home .
'not one of us 
brit and american alike forget
what goes around comes around .
do not buy into the fallacy
that a simpler 
more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their right observed ,
and preserved -
when we turn our back on the basic human right and dignity of 2000 ,
we turn away from the basic human right and dignity of all man .
