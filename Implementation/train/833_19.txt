evil breed is a very strange slasher flick
that is unfortunately no good.the beginning of the film seems promising
but overall it is a disaster.the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad
as the acting.the acting is utal and unbearable.most of the character deliver there line horribly
and even if that is on purpose the method does not work
because the character become annoying.some of the kill are innovative
but it took far too long to get to them.after about a half hour through the movie
we get the first death
( other than in the beginning )
and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes.the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous
looking character 
unrealistic karate like fight 
and a scene
in which a man gets his intestine pulled out of his a*sscrack.none of it is funny
it is just plain ridiculous.the film
then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless.most of the character are clich\u00e9d even for slasher standard
and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days.evil breed is not even laughably bad therefore it fails in it is main task.watch texas chainsaw massacre 
just before dawn 
or see no evil for a real slasher .
