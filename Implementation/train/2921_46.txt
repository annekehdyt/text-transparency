this was the second of three film
that irving berlin wrote for the astaire-roger franchise
and it has by far the largest score
and is somewhat unusual
in that two of the number are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest
to be divvied and/or shared between the principal .
as usual the storyline need n't detain us though for the record
it was based on a play ,
shore leave ,
that also served as the basis for a broadway musical ,
hit the deck .
anyone
who actually saw shore leave in the theatre
may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the role
played by fred and ginger
were created for the movie
but what matter 
as always ,
is the music ,
lyric and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle .
it is a departure from the other title in the franchise in that 1 )
we get to see astaire play the piano - in real life
he was an accomplished pianist
and composed several song 
one of which 
i am building up to an awful let-down ,
had a lyric by johnny mercer
and spent a couple of week in the chart -
and it is the only one of the series
in which he played a serviceman 
albeit an ex-hoofer
who enlisted in the navy
after being dumped by dancing partner ginger
before the story starts .
he gets to perform a little-known but excellent berlin number ,
i would rather lead a band as well as duetting on i am
putting all my egg in one basket
but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumble of world war ii were already being felt - let 's face the music and dance 
one of the most potent ballad ever
performed by the team .
so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water
without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard does not exactly set the screen on fire ;
we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is ,
do they deliver .
answer :
in spade .
