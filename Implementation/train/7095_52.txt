well to answer one person 's question
of `` why does not anyone remember this film ? ''
it is because really ,
not that many person saw it in 1978
and it is not been shown much on tv since .
( if it is on video
that 'd be news to me ! )
even in the era of sometimes mindless comedy
that was the '70 ,
movie-goer had the smart
to avoid this film .
unless they love billy crytal 
paul lynde or joan river
`` that '' much !
paul lynde was funnier on `` bewitched '' or `` hollywood square '' than here .
joan river at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel joke about singer karen carpenter 's lack of weight !
har-har joan !
it also seems like every `` somewhat '' famous name from the era is in the cast .
( most surprising is doris robert later of `` everybody loves raymond '' .
) anyhow 
a somewhat good idea for a storyline 
a man getting pregnant instead of the woman
goes to waste here .
with help from a male friend crystal gets set up with a hooker
to finally lose his virginity
but because she was `` on top '' instead of him ,
he gets pregnant !
( a commantary on woman
taking position of power away from man )
.crystal 's stomach grow ,
he goes through all the female emotion and related feeling .
unfortunately 
he is now a socially misunderstood outcast !
he is attacked by a mob
who wants him rubbed out
( i guess )
.he is forced to go into seclusion
to have his baby ... in a barn .
or if you will 
a manger
( god only knows
where it may have exited from !
ewwww ! )
it turns out
( no shock here )
to be a girl !
everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable ,
the humor is high school level or less.2 star for a good idea and a few good touching and relevant momants w/ billy crystal .
ignore the rest of rabitt test ,
it flunks big time ! i can not believe
roddy mcdowell signed on either !
( end )
