a friend of mine recommended this movie ,
citing my vocal and inflective similarity with de howl ,
the movie 's main character .
i guess to an extent i can see
that
and perhaps a bit more 
i am not very sure whether or not that is flattering portrayal.this is a pretty unique work 
the only movie
to which this might have more than a glancing similarity
would be true romance 
not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue
( whale music is just so much more 
well 
relaxed . )
but instead that they both represent modern love stories.in general i am a big fan of canadian movie about music and musician
( for example i highly recommend hard core logo )
and this film in particular .
it has an innocent charm ,
de is not always the most likeably guy ,
but there is something about him
that draws a sterling sort of empathy .
