i watched fido on some movie channel
and i have to say
that i have become an instant fan .
the film feel like a comic book
that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s ,
you know
the wholesome decade
when they danced to elvis
while dropping nuclear bomb in the desert just for the heck of it .
person were so naive back then
that it is frightening and the idea
that those clean cut folk
would find it normal to have zombie
as pet actually works here.kudos to this canadian production 
the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast ,
including carrie anne moss 
billy connolly 
henry czerny and the kid.it is a shame
this film was not a bigger hit .
it deserved more recognition .
it is much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team .
oh well .
it is an instant classic nonetheless .
