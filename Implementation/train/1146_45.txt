... so what is in those missing 10 minute
that were so horrible
they had to cut them out from the original film ?
we were three year into the film production code ...
barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play 
but here 
carole lombard plays maggie king .
co star fred macmurray is probably best known for `` double indemnity '' 
with stanwyck 
as well as his hit tv show `` my three son '' .
keep an eye out for a young dorothy lamour
( bob hope movie )
and the too-fabulous franklin pangborn ,
who spiced up just about every film put on tape .
of course 
he works in the beauty salon on the ship !
add the sublime charle butterworth and anthony quinn .
good timing and clever banter at the beginning .
maggie 's buddy ella is played by jean dixon ,
who was the best friend in `` holiday '' and `` my man godfrey '' .
in `` swing high '' 
maggie the tourist meets a soldier
who is leaving the army .
maggie misses her boat
when it leaves port
and gets tangled up with the soldier .
the dashing 20-something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in panama
where johnson
( macmurray )
has been playing the trumpet .
maggie 
harry
( butterworth ) ,
and skid band together
and try to figure out how to get back to the state .
some good singing by lamour .
good
( but ief )
acting performance by cecil cunningham as `` murph '' 
the wise 
helpful owner of the local saloon in panama .
while other have lamented at how bad it is ,
it was not so awful ,
and is even a little exotic 
with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film .
