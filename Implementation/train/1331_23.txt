another very good mann flick thank to the father/son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart .
brennan
( ben tatum )
is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne
( red river/ rio bravo ) .
he is there to see
that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend .
`` you are wrong mr. dunston '' .
jeff webster
( stewart )
gives off the impression
he cares only for himself
but it is clear
he can not desert brennan .
john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trapping of justice over the reality of it .
another key theme is helping person
and in turn being helped by person .
the loner can do neither and suffer for it.the caption above play on tatum 's assertion
that he can not live
without his coffee .
this nicotine addiction proves fatal .
probably the first and last time on the screen.i recommend this film
and now own the dvd .
