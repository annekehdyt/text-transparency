pandro s. berman was `` in charge of production ''
but that made him the so-called line producer .
but who produced this epic ,
filmed not in arizona but in california 's mohave desert
where scavenger have made off with all of the remnant of the `` gold temple '' 
the thuggee hut 
the british outpost at muri 
the village of tantrapur 
etc .
the minor technical fault can and must be forgiven .
what is unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music ,
although maybe the academy did not offer such at the time .
a single theme was played in various tempos
including waltz 
march and sweet 
mood-setting .
brilliant !
one of the curious aspect of the production was the widow kipling 's demand .
an actor playing kipling appears iefly before and after the battle scene .
in the initial release his scene were cut 
per mrs. kipling 's demand .
later they were included
and lent a `` connection '' of kipling 's immortal poem to ben hecht 's screenplay .
interestingly 
this very typically and pro-british story was by a great screenwriter
who himself hated the british .
