i will say
that at least the movie makes sense ,
but it is bad .
the acting for the most part is not good
( i think
only sky showed any promise )
and you feel awkward watching it .
all of the scene
that should be meaningful
are really shallow ,
like when ng comes out to her parent .
there are a lot of corny detail 
like the kanji tattoo on the sky 's shoulder 
the magnet on the girl ' refrigerator and the god awful decor at the set ... and the music ... and clothes..and everything .
real life has never been like this movie .
the boy says at one point `` i am gay 
not corny . ''
and not aware .
even the commentary is awful ,
i turned it off after ng talk about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian .
