college student alex gardner
( nicholas celozzi )
is plagued by nightmare of a cellar-dwelling ghoul at alcatraz .
he dreams of cutting off his own hand 
spitting up a worm 
a ghoul ripping open his chest
and being roasted over an open fire .
after his friend see him levitating `` 6 foot '' over his bed 
a helpful 
occult-obsessed teacher
( donna denton )
suggests
that they sneak into alcatraz to face his fear .
of course they go in the middle of the night
when no one is around
to help
when thing get out of hand !
the group become stranded 
alex 's other richard
( tom reilly )
become possessed
and starts killing everyone .
toni basil of `` mickey '' fame shows up as the helpful ghost of sammy mitchell 
lead singer of the group `` bodybag '' .
she teaches alex how to levitate out of his body
and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage
to pad out the running time .
all of the victim show up
as wisecracking ghost a la the griffin dunne character in an american werewolf in london .
the script is full of plot hole 
cheesy dialogue and lame attempt at comedy .
good fx work and cool opening credit
( both by ernest d. farino )
are the only thing
gaining any merit .
basil and devo
( `` whip it '' )
do some song on the soundtrack.score :
2/10
