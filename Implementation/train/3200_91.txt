honestly 
the concept behind `` master of horror '' had something going for it .
big-time horror director
that are now left aside by the industry
being given a chance to direct horror again ,
i was all for it from the start .
that is ,
until i watched some episode ... oh boy ,
it is really bad tv .
not only does it seem like the director are being given very little budget to direct their skit ,
but there seems to be guideline as well 
like shooting in hd for example .
to make a long story short ,
it is bad both for artistic and reason financial reason .
i can not help but compare to the `` tale from the crypt '' 
and the m.o.h .
episode really do not stand the comparison .
tftc was good 
moh is bad ;
according to me here are a few key
to explain it :
tftc was shorter
( around 25 minute for each episode )
than moh
( 50 minute per episode ) ,
i believe
it allowed denser screenplay 
with good idea reoccurring more often 
better overview of an episode 
less chance
to let the plot
be confusing or boring .
duration might have been also the reason
why the budget was better spent on tftc :
director got to have real film music composer
( composer on moh are if inexistent 
very bad ) ,
real actor
( wherea on moh
it is nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor !
) 
real director of photography and 
it can help sometimes ,
real film camera
( while moh is shot on hd camera with very wrongly chosen lens-piece ) ,
the result
of which being that the episode of tftc looked
and felt `` cinematographic '' in the sense
that there was real actor being casted ,
ranging from michael j. fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk dougla ,
but there were also film composer behind it 
of the range of alan silvestri 
great director of photography like dean cundey 
high-end screenplay writer ,
and in that sense each `` tale '' was a little movie of its own true kind .
compared to tftc ,
the `` master of horror '' is quite a lame approach to tv horror .
it is very hard to stand
looking at it
if your standard regarding cinematography are just a little above average ,
because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial 
if not worse .
it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast 
within the first 10 minute usually .
the actor are never-heard before wannabe
( except for fairuza balk 
robert englund 
angela bettis and a few 
but even there 
they are the only famous actor of their episode ) .
the director base for moh was good in the beginning ,
but it is getting worst and worst with every episode :
now if even the director are unknown to the world ,
what remains ?
nothing !
and it is funny how they are starting to have complete unknown director
while they have not even had 
say 
stan winston 
dick maas 
william lustig 
sam raimi 
eric red 
robert harmon 
william friedkin 
jim muro 
stuart gordon 
russell mulcahy ...
if even `` master of horror '' can not ing dead director back to life ,
who will ?
maybe a rerun of tale from the crypt will .
