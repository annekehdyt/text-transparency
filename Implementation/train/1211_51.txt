who would think
andy griffith 's `` helen crump ''
( aneta corsaut )
had a steve mcqueen movie in her past ?
but that is only one of several weird and wonderful thing about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie ,
which might best be described as rebel
without a cause
meets god knows
what from outer space .
the rebel is steven mcqueen
( who would shortly decide
that `` steve '' sounded less prissy ) ,
a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting ;
the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut .
it was bad enough
when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodder ,
but they are considerably more nonplussed
when they encounter a gelatinous ,
man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor
-- and begin gobbling up townfolk right and left .
but will the grown up believe them ?
of course not ,
what do they know ,
they are just kid !
the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best .
the actor take the rather pretentious script very seriously ,
with many a soulful look into each other eye ,
and the `` adult ''
supporting cast probably says `` kid ! ''
very third sentence or so .
but the real pleasure of the film its creature ,
which is well imagined 
well-executed ,
and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense .
and although clearly on the cheap side
( check out those miniature set ,
guy !
) 
the blob is actually a fairly well-made film
-- and there is that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure .
the 40-plus crowd
( myself included )
will enjoy the movie as nostalgia ,
but that will not prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-ead 1950s sensibility ,
and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night
or a more sophisticated `` grown up
only '' get together .
make plenty of jello cube for movie snacking !
