i really wonder
how this show plays in the u.k. and the rest of europe .
it is so self-loathing about being an american
( particularly white american ) .
that could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board .
i love the show
but it is with some reservation
and i feel
it took the easy way out by spoiler spoiler :
crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season .
julie slammed the door shut on any hope
of reviving the show
unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm .
who knows ?
it was a funny 
raunchy and on occasion ,
kinda scary show .
