red rock west
( 1993 )
nicolas cage gets emoiled in a deadly crime
without at first knowing it ,
and the dominos lead to increasing peril 
adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s .
red rock west is often utal and sometimes hilarious ,
and cage pull off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease .
is the plot over the top ?
yes .
is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed 
almost likable killer ?
yes .
does cage stand a chance ?
well 
you have to watch and see .
it never lets up ,
and it took me by surprise the first time
i saw it .
on second viewing yesterday 
i was surprised at how well it held up ,
how well constructed it was ,
and how macae and funny it was at the same time.director ron dahl
( who also helped write )
is known more for his tv work ,
but with rounder and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plot .
it is saved by its humor by the way 
and by the caricature .
the bar is sleazy 
the cop questionable .
and do not miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver .
