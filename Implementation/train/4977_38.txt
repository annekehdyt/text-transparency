unimaginably stupid 
redundant and humiliating closure to the `` nightmare on elm street '' -series !
part 6 is so incompetent
that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven 's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke .
this is not just the worst entry in the `` elm street '' saga ;
it is also one of the most embarrassing horror movie ever made
and it downright offend fan of the genre !
the story is dumb ,
the character drawing are ridiculous ,
the structure is all murky and \u0096 most of all \u0096 the special and visual effect resemble those of a tom and jerry cartoon .
the sequence in which freddy krueger murder his victim are endless and very uninteresting .
were we supposed to be petrified
when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the wall of a house ?
the story takes us back to springwood
and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter .
you would think
he would mention that in one of his previous adventure 
but no there is only one teenage-survivor in springwood
and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter .
another reason
why this final installment is so awful
is the completely illogical structure .
the john doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adult !
how about that :
freddy krueger ,
who spent five entire film
killing nothing but teenager ,
eventually gets beaten by two adult wearing 3d-glass !
sort of like ruin the whole essence ,
does not it ?
as far as i am concerned ,
`` nightmare on elm street '' has always been a dreadfully overrated series but 
up until now ,
even the weakest entry had at least some redeeming element .
`` freddy 's dead '' 
however 
is simply unendurable
and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it .
