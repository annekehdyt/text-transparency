honestly 
my expectation for little bush were low .
i was expecting a little cartoon series with lot of fun
( but rehashed and overdone )
bush joke .
apparently i should have lowered my expectation
even more.the writing was absolutely pathetic .
aside from the cheney-chicken-eating joke ,
and some giggly-little swipe 
it was really boring
and unfunny.the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old 's flash project .
it is disgraceful
that they used macromedia 's product for this ,
because it is capable of so much more.i do not like bush
that much ,
and i enjoy a bush-joke as much as the next guy ,
but this was just a half-hour swipe at the president with several painfully un-funny moment .
trey parker and matt stone did so much more with that is my bush.do yourself a favor 
skip `` lil ' bush ''
and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy
`` that is my bush '' .
you will thank me .
