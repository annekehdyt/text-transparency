unbelievably bad acting 
a no good 
unclear story and flashy image and slow-motion
where they are needed the least :
adrenaline is everything a movie should not be.georgina verbaan
( a so-and-so dutch soap actress
who has not attended her english class )
plays rich girl freya ,
who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking ' .
which basicly is doing dangerous stunt 
eak stuff and annoy person .
and not in a fun jackass way .
then there is dracko
( rivas ) .
he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activity on the side .
then there is freya 's dad
( lockyer ) ,
who plays a dubious role as well .
and 
in the end 
we got jason
( debutant fyall ) ,
the boyfriend of freya.one day 
freya gets disappeared
and everybody seems involved but we 
the viewer really do not care
as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable ,
and the story does not make any sense.why was this even made ?
2/10 .
