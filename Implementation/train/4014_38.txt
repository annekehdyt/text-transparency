an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital
to be close to his wife
who is a patient there
and to try to get her out.this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpiece of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema .
long thought lost ,
a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it ,
which fits perfectly with the image .
it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary
( director kinugasa claimed
he never saw the german film ) .
however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing
( and chilly )
portray of the inner mental state of the inmate in the asylum .
to achieve this ,
the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time :
multiple exposure and out of focus subjective point of view 
tilted camera angle 
fast and slow motion 
expressionist lighting and superimposition among other .
it is also a very complicated film
to follow ,
as it has not got intertitles.the film opens with a montage of shot of rain
hitting the window of the hospital ,
wind shaking tree and of thunder .
the unsettling weather metaphor the mental condition of the patient
and introduces one of the them :
a former dancer .
the combination of sound
produced by rain ,
wind and thunder serve as the music
that incites the dancer to get into a frantic 
almost hypnotic dance .
in another sequence
involving the same patient
engaged in another frenzied dance ,
she is being watched by other inmate .
multiple exposure of the dancer represent the patient ' point of view and their confused `` view '' of the world.these are just two example from this amazing film
trying to represent the patient ' subconscious and view of the `` sane '' world.in three word a must see .
