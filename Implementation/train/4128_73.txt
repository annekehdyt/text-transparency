the spoiler warning is for those person
who want to see for themselves what animal and landscape pass before their eye ,
although i do not mention it in great detail .
`` earth '' is an approx .
90 minute cinema version based on `` planet earth ''
which i watched all on bbc tv.the tv version
was narrated by david attenborough 
a captivating commentator ,
who i had wished
had also done it for `` earth ''
but it is patrick stewart 
star trek 's captain picard .
there are regularly shot of the earth from space
so that is may be appropriate .
in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it .
there are 12 chapter
in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica .
3 animal family 
polar bear 
elephant and whale 
appear in more than one of these part .
each `` chapter '' starts with an indication
how far from north pole or equator it is .
we see something of each kind of animal 
but only mammal and bird 
and some fish 
and some beautiful shot of vegetation 
mountain 
waterfall 
desert and jungle 
a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscape and climate on earth .
you get the impression
that our planet is only inhabited by animal :
person or village or city are not in the film ,
so it is a typical nature documentary ,
but eathtakingly shot
and accompanied by delightful music .
when the film opened i already knew
it would end far too soon for me .
it is a family film ,
so no utal killing of any animal .
when one is caught by his hunter the shot end and in other case
where we see the prey being caught
it is shot in slow-motion
which makes it less violent and watchable for young child
( age limit 6 in the netherland ) .
no blood is shed .
some scene
( newly born animal )
are really cute
and will be adored by kid .
it looks like an ordinary nature film
but
when you know
how many shooting day it took
( 4000 )
and how much money
it has cost
it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty .
it had it is dutch premiere yesterday 
a month before the actual release 
in a cinema of 500 seat ,
of which 15 were taken .
true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goer ,
it seems .
as i knew the tv-series i was of course very curious
if my favourite scene would make it into this movie .
some did not ,
but the most impressive shot
( big waterfall )
did 
luckily .
it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film .
