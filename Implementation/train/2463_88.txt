i am surprised at the comment from poster
stating
that jane powell made the same type of film deanna durbin did .
although they were both young soprano whose film image were crafted by joe pasternak ,
if this film is any indication ,
they were almost polar opposites.while 
in three smart girl 
durbin play an impulsive `` little miss fixit 
''
who 
after some setback 
manages to reunite her divorced parent 
in its ' semi-remake 
three daring daughter 
jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi
when she refuses to accept him and strong arm her younger sibling
into rejecting him 
too .
from the durbin and powell film i have seen ,
i would say
these disparate quality permeate the early film of both of these talented young performers.as for durbin 's performance in three smart girl ,
i find it completely winning 
and most impressive .
although it is clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line reading in some of the more energetic scene
that this is an early film for deanna ,
watching the self-confident 
knowing and naturally effervescent manner
in which she delivers her line and perform overall ,
and the subdued and tender manner
she project the more serious scene ,
you would never guess
that this was the first film role of a 14 year-old girl
whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two year of vocal instruction .
given
that this film 
and durbin herself 
were much publicized at the time as `` universal 's last chance 
''
the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age ,
but you would never know it from the ease and assurance durbin display on screen .
although she is clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera
( this was equally true of the early performance of much more experienced contemporary like garland 
rooney 
o'connor and jane powell ) ,
durbin project an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera
that is absolutely unique to her 
and 
even here 
in her first film 
she manages to remain immensely likable
despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character ,
and
though she is occasionally shrill ,
she never for a second project the coy and arch quality
that afflicted many child star ,
including jane powell and some of the other young soprano
who followed in the wake of her success.in short 
like all great singing star ,
durbin was much more than just a `` beautiful voice . ''
on the other hand ,
while durbin 's pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument ,
the most remarkable thing about it 
to me ,
was the way
she is able to project her song ,
without the slightest bit of affectation or `` grandne ''
that afflict the singing of adult opera singer like lily pon ,
grace moore and jeanette macdonald in film of the periodthe film is also delightful ,
heavily influenced by screwball comedy ,
it backs durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pro such as charle winninger 
binnie barne 
alice brady 
ray milland and mischa auer .
the story is light and entertaining .
true 
it is hardly `` realistic 
''
but why would anyone expect it to be ?
if you want : ''
realistic '' rent the grape of wrath or triumph of the will .
on the other hand ,
if you are looking for a genuine 
sweet 
funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully 
charismatic and gifted adolescent `` lead 
''
and terrific supporting player ,
this film will not let you down .
