i first heard of unisol 2
when i drove past a cinema
when i was on holiday in america .
i really did not take much notice of it
until i bought the original on dvd
which led me to find out about its three sequel .
i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friend
what they thought of it .
despite their horrific criticism of it ,
i still went out of my way
to see it
and was on the ink
of buying
it until i saw it for hire on dvd .
i was not expecting much but thought
that it must have been half decent
to get a theatrical release in the us ,
after all 
how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen ?
well 
nothing could have prepared me for this .
it is so bad i almost cried .
what a total waste of 80 minute and \u00a32.50 .
it is hard to explain
how bad this move is .
honestly .
this is idiotic film making .
no 
it is more than idiotic .
i just can not believe how this got made .
i can not believe
that someone out there has not murdered mic roger .
how stupid can person possibly be - firstly ,
van damme actually thinking the script
and finished film was good .
secondly 
the fact
that xander berkley 
of terminator 2 and air force one status ,
commited himself to this film .
i simply can not believe the stupidity of this movie .
it takes itself so seriously
but comes across to the audience like a spoof .
here is an example :
jcvd 's daughter
( yes ,
luc is now a human again )
- `` i want my daddy '' ,
seth- `` so do i '' .
oh yeah 
and some guy try to shut down seth
by pulling three huge lever with - wait
for it - on and off written on them .
the acting all round is like playschool acting .
i am sure mr director modelled luc 's reporter girlfriend on april o'neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtle -
she refuses to go
because she ' ... needs her story ' .
i mean come on -
how many clich can a film possibly use ?
please listen to me fellow imdb user - do not touch this with a barge pole .
to conclude 
universal soldier :
the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie .
in fact 
if they were not called unisol
then you would never know
it was a sequel .
luc is now a human again -
what the hell ! ? !
the only place
in which he can access the internet
is in a stripclub .
all the new uni sol look like they were dragged off the street ,
they are that unconvincing .
this is pure torture to watch ,
so do yourself a favour -
do not torture yourself .
p.s - best part of the movie :
romeo jumps off a building and shouts 'oh sh*t ' .
