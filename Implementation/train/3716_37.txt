it is not always easy to explain what a movie is like ,
but this time i think
i have found it .
it reminded me of two movie :
trainspotting
( small time criminal scoring some drug
and doing some stupid thing in schotland )
and the blair witch project
( because of the style of filming )
.it is about the loyalty between two friend ,
one of them is coming out of jail ,
the other one has not been caught yet .
with a stolen vehicle
they drive through the scottish countryside
but than run out of petrol .
as they try to find some fuel ,
they find a farm in the middle of nowhere .
the farmer thinks
they want to rob him and point a gun at one of them .
than it all goes wrong .
one of the friend accidentally shoots the farmer 's daughter
and they have to run .
what follows is a man hunt through the field and wood of schotland .
the two friend literally have to run for their lives.apparently this movie was shot in only 12 day time .
ok 
that is not exactly unbelievable
because the biggest part of it is always in the same place :
the scottish countryside ,
but i still find that quite amazing .
especially
because this is not actually a bad movie .
it is perhaps not the greatest movie ever ,
but they still can be proud of what they achieved .
i had a nice time
watching it
and overall i enjoyed the movie .
i give it a 7/10 .
