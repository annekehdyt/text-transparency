every country
which has a working film industry
has some sane
( and maybe some insane ) artist
which make movie
that you can only completely understand
when you are a part of this country .
i guess
hundstage is such a movie.you see the lowest level of austria 's society 
dirty 
disturbed 
weird 
hateful .
but they still have enough money
so they can afford tuned car and big house .
and they are definitely doing a lot of strange thing here
which maybe seems for them 'normal '
because they are doing it through their whole life .
from a normal human viewpoint
you can now easily follow the movie
and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria 's art movie.but
if you live here
and you know
the person you see the character in hundstage as the tumor of the society .
a society
that is going more insane from day to day ,
creating their own rule
that nobody else can understand ,
cave the social system from within .
and you see the person .
sitting in the park ,
standing at the opposite street corner 
queuing in the same line .
maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco
you may visit .
maybe you even work with them in your job
or they are living next to your house .
you start to hate them without exactly knowing why .
you will try to get away -
but you can not .
maybe you will end up like them .
but it seems 'normal ' for you
because you are doing it through your whole life now ... life is not so ight
though austria is one of the richest country in the world .
it has beautiful person ...
but some are also ugly .
there are a lot of hard working person
trying their best ...
but there are also some riding on the back of other
and destroying everything
that the folk of austria has built up so far.a very pessimistic movie .
