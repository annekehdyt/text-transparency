meryl streep was incredible in this film .
she has an amazing knack for accent ,
and she shows incredible skill in this film overall .
i really felt for her
when lindy was being persecuted .
she was played realistically 
too .
she got cranky 
upset 
and unpleasant as the medium and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt .
i did not expect much from the film initially ,
but i really got interested in it ,
and the movie is based on a real person and real event .
it turned out
to be better than i had anticipated .
sam neill was also outstanding ;
this is the best work i
have seen from him ,
and i have really liked him in other movie
( the piano 
for example ) .
i gave the film a 7 ,
but
if i could rate just the acting ,
i would give the it a 9.5 
and a perfect 10 for streep .
