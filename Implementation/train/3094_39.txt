i just got back from this free screening ,
and this `` osama witch project '' is the hands-down worst film i have seen this year 
worse than even `` catwoman '' -
which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.in `` september tape 
'' a `` film crew '' of `` documentary journalist '' head to afghanistan -
despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip 
the condition and 
oh yeah 
the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife 's death on sept. 11 -
to track down osama bin laden.they `` made '' eight tape on their journey ,
which now `` document '' their travel and 
of course 
their attempt
to kill the terrorist leader .
( the eight tape 
thankfully 
all end at point significan not in the narrative ,
which is convenient for a `` documentary .
`` ) the psychotic 
idiotic protagonist -
who is given to long 
significan not speech
that he probably learned watching `` macgyver '' - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew
as he gets them further
and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishap .
i do not know
why he did not just wear a sign on his back
that said
`` shoot me .
`` the crew 's translator 
supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason ,
does little more than whine and gets baffled
as the idiot hero leads them into doom .
you wish
they had ought along someone on their trip
to call them all morons.around `` tape 4 
''
i began rooting for the terrorist
to shoot the film crew .
