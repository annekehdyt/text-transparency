in one word :
excruciating .
i was advised to read some article about this film 's philosophical meaning afterward 
but ,
having sat through the movie 's interminable 115 minute
and being slowly crushed beneath its bloated symbolism and lava-flowing oppressiveness ,
it seemed better to just report my reaction to the movie .
after all 
who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand ?
and this flick was dismal .
lead actor claude laydu 
from the film 's opening to its end 
wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony
as to be practically indistinguishable from the film 's eternal 
dreary voice-over .
filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both ,
as they basically say
the same thing :
the priest of amicourt is a wretched human being .
the story 
about a persecuted priest
who tries to help out a troubled rich family ,
does nothing toward making its character remotely interesting or sympathetic ,
as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos ,
and the priest 
himself 
comes across as a nosy pest .
the last 30 minute suggests some eath-taking message about grace and one man 's suffering
equaling that of other ,
but due to all the indulgent close-up of a suffering laydu and the vague subtext in robert bresson 's script ,
all i felt was 
finally ,
it is over ,
let 's have some ice-cream .
interesting for fan of bresson fanatic paul schrader 
just to see how many element of character
and setting schrader carried into in his own script and movie 
especially `` taxidriver '' 
`` raging bull '' and `` light sleeper '' .
