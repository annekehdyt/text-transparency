some wonder why there were not anymore mrs. murphy movie after this one .
will it is because this movie totally blew snot .
disney was not the right studio
to run this film .
maybe touchstone
( well ,
they are owned by disney ,
but it would be more adult ) .
the film is too kid-ish ,
as the book series is not .
the casting is all wrong for the character .
the character do not even act the way
they do in the book .
and why was tucker changed to a guy ?
he is a girl in the frigging book !
was this done
to make the film appeal to boys ?
sheesh .
and where was pewter 
the gray cat ?
one of the funniest character from the book is absent from this filth .
rita mae brown is a good writer ,
but letting disney blow her work was wrong .
an animated feature film 
perhaps in the vane of don bluth 's artwork would suit a better mrs. murphy film .
overall 
i give this a 2 ,
because at least disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series .
but 
i wish they did better .
either way 
i still have my book to entertain me .
