although super mario 64 is not like the rest of the game in the series ,
it is still a classic
and is every bit as good as the old game .
game with this much replay value are few and far between .
plus 
this game has so much variety .
there are 15 level each with several different task
you can do ,
and many other hidden task .
the game is not very challenging ,
but its lack of challenge does not take away from the game at all .
once you beat it ,
you will want to erase your game and start again .
and its just as much fun the second time 
or third time 
or two hundredth time .
a must own for any nintendo 64 owner ,
and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64 .
