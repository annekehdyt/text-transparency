this is one of the few film
where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book .
the story is clear 
accessible 
amusing and interesting and the musical number are without a doubt exceptional .
i adored the cyclical rendition of 'the old home guard ' and the charming 'portobello road ' 
a great combination of early animation + real actor technique which ,
though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece .
the background of the second world war worked well
and was not omitted
as the film got under way ,
which so often happens in 'evacuee ' stories.an often far too underrated film ,
it produces no end to enjoyment for person of all age .
the performance from the actor are exceptionally well done
and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed .
guaranteed to put a smile on your face !
