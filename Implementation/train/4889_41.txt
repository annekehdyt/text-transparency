despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed ,
this film was a disappointment .
yes 
it is far more realistic than other war film of the period
for depicting the mud 
boredom and frustration of the grunt ,
but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking
that is all there is to this movie .
there is no plot
and the dialogue is monotonous .
it is not that a good war film need to have a battle scene every five minute .
one of the best world war ii film 
`` twelve o'clock high 
'' has very little action .
but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension .
the exception to `` the story of g.i .
joe '' is a ief battle segment
( titled `` city under siege '' on the dvd )
which takes place in italy .
admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scene of any war movie .
but ala 
the rest of the film is not worth
watching just for this highlight .
another turn-off is pvt .
dondaro ,
played by wally cassell ,
who is meant to be a `` romeo ''
but comes off a pervert .
by contrast 
sgt .
warnicki is a sympathetic 
if flawed 
man .
as he says to capt .
walker
( mitchum )
when volunteering for another patrol :
`` every step forward is a step closer ... to home . ''
but that last step \u0096 one patrol too many \u0096 drife him over the mental ink .
too bad the rest of the movie does not do justice to some otherwise fine touch .
as for meredith 's portrayal of pyle ... it is practically comatose .
