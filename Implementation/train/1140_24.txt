writer/director john hughe covered all basis
( as usual )
with this bitter-sweet `` sunday afternoon '' family movie .
`` curly sue '' is a sweet 
precocious orphan 
cared for from infancy by `` bill '' .
the pair live off their wit
as they travel the great us of a. fate match them with a `` very pretty '' yuppie lawyer ,
and the rest is predictable.kid will love this film ,
as they can relate to the heroine ,
played by 9 year old alisan poter
( who went on to be the `` you go girl ! ''
of pepsi commercial ) .
the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 ,
as she is urged to think about going to school .
some of her vocabulary suggest
that she is every day of 9 or older.similar to `` home alone '' ,
there is plenty of slap-stick and little fist punching big fat chin .
again 
this is `` formula '' film making ,
aimed at a young audience .
entertaining and heartwarming .
do not look for any surprise ,
but be prepared to shed a tear or two .
