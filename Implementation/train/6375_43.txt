i do not think
i have ever felt this let down by a film before .
after loving guy ritchie 's two previous film
( i do not count
swept away -
he was pussy blind ) ,
i was so looking forward
to seeing this .
the review were poor 
then again ,
i do not trust the press anyway .
more worrying was the fact
that the internet buzz was
that this was a bit of a stinker ,
so it was with some trepidation i handed over my \u00a34.80 yesterday afternoon.i am
not even going to try to explain this film ,
mainly because i have not got a clue
what was going on and at one point i was honetly close to standing up
and asking
if it was just me
who did not get it !
unfortunately i think
ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife 's trap
of taking himself far too seriously.it seems
it was not good enough for him
to make film with good plot 
laugh 
snappy dialogue and good character .
it is almost
as if he had a checklist of film
he wanted to rip off ,
here are some of the one i noticed :
the matrix 
fight club 
kill bill 
the usual suspect 
vanilla sky ... i think
the most frustrating thing is that the performance from the two main actor 
jason statham and ray liotta 
were actually very good
and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction
that let the film down.so a big 
big thumb down from me .
