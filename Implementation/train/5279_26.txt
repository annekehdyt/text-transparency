along with patrick mcgoohan and robert culp 
jack cassidy was an iconic columbo villain .
the very first `` proper '' episode of columbo ,
following two standalone pilot ,
`` murder by the book '' is not far off classic status.jack cassidy plays ken franklin 
one half of a murder mystery writing partnership .
his partner jim is the talented one ,
whereas ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill
for promoting the book .
as soon as jim has decided
he no longer requires ken 's marketing skill 
ken hatches a plot
to kill jim .
except it is not a new plot ,
it is actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline
originally intended for one of their book.it does not take columbo long to work out
that ken is the murderer ,
although unfortunately another murder has to take place
( ken romance and then kills a key witness )
before columbo has enough evidence
to secure a conviction.nothing whatsoever wrong with `` murder by the book '' ,
but it is not quite top-notch .
i would just give `` publish or perish '' the edge over this :
both episode feature jack cassidy and the world of publishing ,
but `` publish or perish '' is a fraction more tense and unpredictable .
but this is still a great episode .
