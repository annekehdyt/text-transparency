you talking ' to me ?
( 1987 )
is a pretty bad movie
starring some dude
who i have never seen
before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood
who try to become an actor .
he has a heavy jone for taxi driver
as try to use
that shtick to make it big .
when he learns the hard fact of life ,
he does what everyone else does ,
changes his image !
he goes from good fella to a surf 's up dude over night .
his friend can not believe the change
( but he scores with faith ford
and get 's a cool paying gig ) .
can this young punk keep his street cred whilst
making it big ? this is a real lame movie
that try too hard to incorporate too many thing at once .
an interesting idea
that falls apart due to poor execution .
who knows ,
maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run
because the film maker fumbled the ball this time.do not waste your time with this movie .
unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump.xx
