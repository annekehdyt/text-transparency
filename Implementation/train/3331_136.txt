it is hard to say
which comes out on top 
james cagney 's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excess of busby berkeley 's three grand showtopper at the close .
i give it a tie 
with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirty musical .
although the movie clearly belongs to cagney ,
joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line .
and what is the story line ?
it is about chester kent
( cagney )
who produces musical ,
and who now is just about out of business as the talky take over .
he starts doing prologue ,
live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts .
he gets the idea
to do bigger one and more of them ,
moving them around the country .
he is a ball of fire and idea ,
and he needs all the idea
he can get
to keep relentlessly
producing these thing .
but a rival is spying on him and stealing his idea ; nan prescott
( blondell ) ,
his wise-cracking secretary 
loves him
but he is too busy too notice ;
an office girl in black-rimmed 
round glass
( ruby keeler )
wants a chance to dance ;
his wife turns up saying
she did not divorce him after all ;
a blonde gold-digger is setting her hook in him ;
his partner are cheating him ... my gosh ,
what is next ?
this may all sound like a lot to digest ,
but everything happen fast ,
with cagney bouncing 
strutting 
striding 
finger-snapping 
barking order and occasionally - until the big last number
when he goes all out singing and dancing
-- doing a step or two just to show
how it is done .
instead of `` let 's put on a show 
gang ''
we have `` we need to build three show in three day ,
so lock the door and let 's start rehearsing . ''
these three super prologue are going to feature 40 chorine 
spectacular effect
and will mean a rich contract ,
with forty kent unit in deluxe movie house ... the whole apollo movie house circuit !
exhaustion threaten 
foot ache 
but all those unbilled chorine in skimpy costume
( which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour ;
you can quickly spot sothern
but lamour is more generic )
stay the course ,
dancing their heart out 
giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty .
and then the curtain go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie house 
one after the other on the same night ,
with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night
whether
he will save chester 's skin or not .
first up is `` honeymoon hotel '' with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number
that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness 
with ide and groom
( some might even be married ) ,
bedroom and bed ,
and door with `` do not disturb '' sign .
then on to the next theater and 11 minute of `` by a waterfall ''
that probably had the warner brother accountant worrying about bankruptcy .
this number is so excessive
-- dozen of swimming girl 
tree 
fountain 
a huge grotto with waterslide 
a giant pool --
you would
never think
there was a depression on .
berkeley pull out all his trick
-- synchronization 
human pattern 
leg
and arm doing all sort of precision thing --
and he does it in the water ,
with a lot of underwater photography
looking up .
the girl are sure game .
they come up smiling with water in their eye
and still hit their mark .
the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting .
ruby keeler ,
who has a couple of quick shot in the water ,
is the only one
who looks a bit cautious .
and finally 
the smash finale ... 11 minute of cagney dancing
and singing with keeler to `` shanghai lil 
'' with all sort of bar girl and their customer 
unusual in that the race are mixed up .
there is cagney and keeler dancing on the bar ,
dancing on a table 
cagney fighting .
there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marine 
hupping back and forth 
rifle tossed and caught .
then ... this is true ... a human picture form of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle .
this may be the only hollywood musical production
that has ever featured roosevelt 
a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitute .
that is entertainment 
folk .
it is great !
of course 
chester 's prologue get the big contract and nan gets chester .
the movie is full of juicy clich\u00e9s
that make us smile .
ruby keeler is so endearing
as she earnestly stomps out her tap with her arm flying
that you want to help her along .
joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood female
who might have been more beautiful but
who had a lot less wit and personality .
the movie 
however 
belongs to cagney ,
who grabs and shake it ,
and to berkeley 
a man
for whom too much was never too much .
