after growing up in the gritty street of detroit 
mi ,
and having friend
who traveled to new york ball ,
i fell into the lifestyle
of being a house member .
i joined the house of theieve .
we adapted the same rule as most house ,
but we were professional crook
that would boost and commit credit card fraud
to obtain the fabulous jewel and clothe we desired .
i even learned how to profess the making of check and driver 's license and cash them in over seventeen state ,
until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison .
but 
i learned a lot from these queen in this movie
and i highly recommend
you watch it yourself .
you can even read about how i grew up in the house here in detroit
and the criminal activity we indulged in .
my book 
identity scheme is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity scheme dot com .
but trust me 
it is a lot better
than paris is burning ,
because its a 2005 make .
