well made and stylish
while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fan
to get interested in the genre than the later argento entry
which go overboard in all directions.for fan of these crazed italian thriller ,
they will appreciate george hilton and the turn his character takes
and what he is put through .
the camera-work is fresh with dash of graphic violence and odd ,
but appropriate choice and a good not overblown music score as well .
the less you know about the story the better
to make it work.the
only thing lacking
in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo
is that the story does not have that extra sexual or psychological 
or both element
to put it over the top .
it is more a routine mystery ,
the character are well defined
but live or die according to the plot
not according to their own virtue and flaws.the recent dvd
( 2005 )
release is beautiful looking and definitely the way
to see the film ,
unless these ever get art house screening
which seems unlikely .
