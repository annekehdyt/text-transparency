this is a really fun movie .
one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch
as the plot gets more and more twisted ; more and more funny .
sally field 
teri hatcher
( in her hey-day ) ,
kevin klein 
elisabeth shue 
robert downey 
jr ...
it is all these well-known 
quality actor acting
as if they are soap opera stars/producer .
if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought ,
`` how on earth did they come up with this idea ? ?
`` 
you will love this movie .
i have seen it multiple time ;
and each time i watch it 
the more i appreciate the humor 
the more i realize just how well-acted it really is .
do not expect oscar quality .
this is a fun movie
to entertain ,
not some artsy attempt at finding `` man 's inner man '' 
etc .
sit back 
relax 
and laugh .
