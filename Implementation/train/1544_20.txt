just imagine the real hitler ,
who was a master of propaganda and speech ,
would have been such a mumbling moron
as carlyle portrayed him in this film.nobody
would have followed him 
not even a desperate ,
unemployed guy in the 1920s.this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself ,
disguised as `` true history '' .i pity everyone
who actually believed anything from this show .
carlyle and the producer did not get anything right with this.why was hitler able to win so many person 
a whole county for his idea
if we was such a sausage ?
why did person follow him to death ?
by portraying him as such a loser
they make their own film totally unbelievable .
this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myth about one of the most important person of the last century .
imagine a film about churchill
where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 min .
this film is a disgrace and i wonder
how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck .
