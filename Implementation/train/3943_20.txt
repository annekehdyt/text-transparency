for the big thinker among us 
`` the intruder '' is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france
that gives so-called `` art film '' a bad name .
the story is something about a bitter old coot 
louis trebor
( michel subor ) ,
who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant ,
but beyond that 
i have no idea
who any of the person in the movie were or why
they were doing what they were doing .
with no coherent storyline to boast of 
the movie loses us early on ,
though i am perfectly willing to admit
that there might be somebody out there
who actually gets some deep message out of this film .
this muddled 
snail-paced drama runs a full two hour and five minute -
though i seriously doubt
anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credit .
