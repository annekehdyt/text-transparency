$ 25,000 pyramid clue :
deep blue sea .
tremor .
slither .
eight legged freaks.pyramid category :
movie
that were funnier and more thrilling than snake on a plane.hell ,
with that definition i would have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane !
as superior to snake in both laugh and thrills.the sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movie :
anaconda !
besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo-cube-o.wilson-stoltz-wuhrer in the same flick ,
you had jon voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist .
his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a `` so-ludicrous-it is-fun '' movie.in the end ,
snake on a plane is definitive proof
that studio execs and fanboy make the worst collaborator possible .
every big scene had been discussed
and dissected so much the last year ,
all
that was left to amuse by opening night
was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat
that had to be mopped up at my theater .
i heard more forced laugh here than at a studio taping
for `` according to jim '' .
