i can not believe
i wasted 80 minute of my life
watching this terrible film i
kept hoping
it was going to get better by the end
but boy was i wrong .
the plot was abysmal ,
the acting was extremely poor
and the special effect were awful .
not even the 2 beautiful girl could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess .
however i can not lie ,
some of the line in this film were quite memorable such
as when the asian boy says
''
i lost my virginity to the babysitter
so f**** stereotype ''please do not waste your time with this crash
unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh .. maybe
that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mate
