i was pretty surprised with this flick .
even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed
that this movie took 7 year
to make
and still turned out good .
the acting was pretty impressive
and the story really captivated me .
my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too aupt for my taste .
but hey
if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded.i
would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella r\u00edos
who is an excellent spanish talent
( something hard to find now day with all the bad novela over acting ) .
antonella r\u00edos truly is a star on the rise .
