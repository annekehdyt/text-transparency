my first opinion on this movie were of course bad.i was expecting a horrible 
crappy acting 
bad entertainment 
ridiculous special effect movie.what i got was actually not that bad.the special effect were absolutely horrible ,
but i found the movie itself quite interesting ,
and the script was actually pretty good and decent.the acting was not that bad 
and overall i had fun
watching this movie.it is still a pretty bad film ,
but it is not completely worthless like i thought
it was going to be ,
and i am pleased to know
that this movie managed to wow me ,
even when it was not that good.overall ,
it is a film
that should be avoided ,
but to me it was not as bad
as i was expecting it to be .
