i am stunned to discover the amount of fan this show has .
have not said
that friend was 
at best an 'average ' sitcom 
and not as great as other have made out .
let 's face it ,
if it was not for the casting of courtney cox arquette 
david schwimmer 
matthew perry 
lisa kudrow 
jennifer aniston and matt le blanc ,
then
who knows
whether this show would 've lasted as long
as it has done .
i very much doubt that .
although as the series progressed 
friend got more progressively predictable 
lame and boring
that i could not care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in tv history- or of their plight ,
nor of who was sleeping with whom .
and it went from being funny in the first four season
to occasionally funny .
and even when it had all these a-list hollywood actor from the movie world ,
i still did not bother to tune in .
the writing in friend became stale
that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onward and as for the ending ,
well it was predictable to say
the least.what was annoying
though was that this lasted for ten season 
whilst some of my favourite show lasted for only three 
four season for instance and were eventually cancelled
and taken off the air for good .
the show should have came to an immediate halt by the time
the cast wanted bigger salary .
in truth 
as much as the series waned 
it was the show
that was bigger than the actor themselves 
not the other way round .
when it ended in 2004 ,
i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom .
now 
there is talk of a friend reunion show
coming to our tv screen very soon .
and yet 
i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever .
