gere and dane star as 2 worker for the department of public safety
who keep track of released sex offender .
gere ,
who plays babbage ,
refer to them as his flock .
gere is an over obsessed vigilante
whom is on his way out .
he is training 
new comer allison ,
to take over his job .
gere sees his flock as very sick 
disturbed puppy .
he asks them question
that are not on the list ,
and try to act like the police and solve crime .
he keeps getting warned for this behavior ,
hence the reason he is being replaced .
during his final few day on the job 
a young girl goes missing ,
and babbage is sure
it is one of his flock whom has gone astray .
him and allison narrow a list down
and discover some of the offender have gone awol .
so 
he decides
that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police .
that part is a little far fetched.there
is some sick ,
twisted stuff shown in this film .
like when babbage and allison go to this building
where a bunch of sick person do disturbing thing to each other .
also 
there are the person
who kidnapped the girl .
at the end of the film 
we see
what sick freak they are .
however 
i would not call this movie excessive
because not really much is shown on film.final verdict :
if you like thriller and film about serial killer and cop chasing killer ,
then you will like this .
