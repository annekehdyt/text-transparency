`` while traveling in the mountain ,
a man is attached by a mysterious creature
that promptly departs 
leaving no trace of its presence .
unbeknownst to the man 
he has been attacked by a werewolf
and now he is inherited the curse
associated with such creature .
now our hero must race against time
to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.horrifically re-produced from the original spanish ,
`` the fury of the wolf man '' loses whatever charm
it may have possessed in its original form .
lycan nothropic paul naschy 's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual .
dominatrix scientist perla cristal and sexy assistant ver\u00f3nica luj\u00e1n never get close enough to truly titillate .
the often incoherent storyline is not even ghoulishly amusing .
