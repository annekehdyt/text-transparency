i revisited grand canyon earlier this year
when i set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990 's .
i first saw the film
when i was 17 year old .
how did i hear about it ?
it was reviewed ,
and recommended highly 
by siskel and ebert in 1991 ,
and i eventually caught
it on video a year later.it is a great film 
a powerful film 
a healing film 
about the power of listening 
truly listening to one another .
i have seen it six time now ,
and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing .
but why the poor review for this movie ?
maltin 's movie guide gives it two out of four .
too melodramatic 
too much coincidence 
too sappy 
are the expression
that i read the most .
yes 
there is melodrama in this story ,
and yes 
there is a lot of coincidence 
too .
but it delivers with an intensity and force
that seems supple .
for all of the `` plot ''
that exists in grand canyon ,
such as drive-by shooting 
a police chase 
an earthquake 
a love affair 
a woman 's discovery of a baby in the bush 
another shooting 
a near accident by a new driver 
and worldly advice from a homeless man 
this movie wins
because of the smart performance by kevin kline 
steve martin 
mary mcdonnell 
alfre woodard 
danny glover 
and jeremy sisto .
it also succeeds
because of lawrence kasdan 's skillful direction and writing .
you know
that this is not just another movie
when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film
that involves kevin kline being harassed by four black youth .
danny glover plays a tow truck driver
who assists the kline character ,
but not before he gets harassed too 
by the leader of the bunch .
listen to the dialogue
as the kid suggests to glover 
''
are you afraid of me
because of me ,
or because i have a gun ?
`` .grand canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another .
steve martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer
who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind .
i think
his character is a warning
that `` the good '' can carry us forward ,
that idealism is a virtue ,
but one
that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon.i fear
that grand canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new release at the video store .
but with the deal now on older release as low as 99 cent 
i plead with anyone
who has read this far into a review from a reviewer
that you will thank
after having rented it ,
grand canyon is something special .
if you loved magnolium 
another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist theme ,
you will love grand canyon 
too .
