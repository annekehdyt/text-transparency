i saw this movie the other night
and i have to honestly say
it is one of the worst film i
have ever seen .
the acting is fair ,
but the plot is totally ridiculous .
a killer is born
because of all the `` energy used to make the movie ''
and if the film is burned the killer will die ?
how unbelievable is that ?
the character were underdeveloped
to say the least ... for example 
all of a sudden the man mentions `` are not you trying to complete the film
because your mother could not ? ''
so we are supposed to go along with this ?
we had no idea
it was her daughter until half way through the film .
the movie really did not spotlight on anyone ,
we did not know anything about the main person
who survived except ringwald 's character was a whiney actress ,
the guy was on the set
when the person died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother .
not truly diving in to know who they are .
seemed thing were rushed to just get to the killing .
the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed .
anyone
who enjoyed this piece of crap ,
obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making .
i can not believe
anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture .
it is not funny ,
it was not scary
and was cliche through the entire film .
i found myself
predicting what would happen before each scene ,
which believe
you me was not hard at all to do .
it is a disgrace and i
am deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess .
1/10 .
