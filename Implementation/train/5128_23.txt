it seems evident from this adaptation
that he did not .
not only did he leave the plot behind ,
he made up his own !
the thing
that he chose to leave in
were so ridiculously unbelievable
that i was happy
he chose to leave out some of the most important part of the novel .
the plot was hazy 
inconsistent and choppy to say the least .
i do not want to say anything mean-spirited about the actor ,
but they can not act !
dicken is difficult 
of course ,
but this is pathetic !
micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century kramer ,
and the less said about betsy trotwood the better !
if you want to see the real copperfield ,
watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation .
as for the screenplay writer 
i think
he read the cliff 's note !
