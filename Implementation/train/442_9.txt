this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kid
to follow and too repetitious
to entertain older kid .
the message of the film
-- about dealing with loss --
is subverted by the return of the young girl 's father during the film 's credit .
team rocket provide some amusement ,
but they are not really part of the small plot ,
so they do not appear very often .
