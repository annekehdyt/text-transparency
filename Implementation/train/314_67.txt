as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review
that i do not like johnny test .
now i think i know
what person are going to say ,
`` how do you know
how bad it is ?
have you ever watched it ?
`` 
i did watch this show a couple time
because i am
studying film and animation and this just does not hold a candle to my standards.i want to first talk about the animation
because it is one of the most confusing thing
i have ever seen .
like the first two season or only first season had hand drawn animation .
i thought
it was a nice show
to look at
when it was hand drawn
but then it switched to flash animation
and the quality went down by a huge amount.so
that is one strike in my eye
but let look at the story of the show .
it tries way too hard
to be like dexter 's lab
but there are difference
because instead of one red headed scientist there is two
and they are both female .
there is a talking dog
( why ?
) ,
and the parent attitude are switched somewhat .
i have other
but i do not think
i can write them here
( i do not mean cursing but i mean i do not know
if there is a limit for word . ) .
everything else though is spot on 
even a deedee character johnny himself .
it just tries so hard to be dexter
but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.lastly i want to talk about the joke .
remember in dexter lab some of the joke involved yelling ?
yes 
yelling can be good for a joke or two
but dexter 's lab also had sly remark
that made me have to go back and check
to get the joke .
johnny test just forgets all that and just yell 50 % of the time
and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears .
that is not comedy ,
that stupid comedy
( i know
what some person are thinking .
is not three stooge stupid comedy ?
watch that and johnny test back to back
and you laugh more at the first option . ) .
sometime the joke are based on bizarre situation
which 
like chowder 
makes me mad .
i have a rule for cartoon and comedy all together :
to much bizarre does not equal comedy ,
it makes you just think `` what am i watching ?
`` .so it strikes out on all account .
do not watch this show
if you have any respect for comedy in anyway 
shape 
or form .
