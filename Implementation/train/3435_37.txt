no 
basically your watching something
that does not make sense .
to not spoil the film for person
who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story.a normal everyday to day woman ,
is walking down a street
then find 's herself driving by in her own car .
she follows her and many event take place during that time
that include her and her family.i specifically made an account to comment on this film ,
of how horribly written this was .
the acting was great ,
the event were great ,
but the story just ought it nowhere -
it could of been added to tremendously
and be made into a worldwide epidemic .
i am not sure
what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this 
usually at the end of film most of your question get answer
but this film has you asking ,
what just happened and 1 hour 20 minute just passed for nothing.spoiler starts__they had this area between 2 dimension
( our and behind the glass )
that would come into our world
and kill us .
it was not elaborated on all during the film ,
and you never know
how it was happening or why it was or when it happened .
nothing gets explained during the film .
the main character should not of even been the main character .
at the end of the film the guy
who finally figures
it all out and runs away
( her sister boyfriend )
should of been the main character
but sadly the movie ends 20 second after .
i bought this movie for $ 10 ,
threw it out right after.. do not waste your time .
i really hope nothing like this is made again .
