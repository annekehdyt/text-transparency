i am surprised
that anyone
involved with the production of this series
would actually admit responsibility .
the script is so unfunny
it must have been written by someone
who failed the entrance exam for the canadian comedy writer ' union
( and that is saying something ! ) .
get out your binocular
if you want ,
but there is nothing resembling a joke in sight .
ronnie corbett must have been flat oke to demean himself with this rubbish .
the rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability i am amazed
it lasted past the first episode - correction 
past the audition .
all i can say to those
who are amused by it is
that they must be very easily entertained .
and it is obvious that the production cost must have been all of \u20a4100 per episode .
and just in case anyone thinks
i am commenting as a foreigner
who is unfamiliar with english humour ,
i must add
that i am indeed english .
