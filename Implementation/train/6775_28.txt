this is essentially a variation on house of wax 
in both the plot and the type of role
played by the star of both movie ,
vincent price.in both picture
he plays a talented artist
who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity
when his creation are usurped by other 
less talented and less scrupulous person .in this movie he plays a designer of illusion for stage magician
who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist 
the great rinaldo
( john emery )
insists
that he honour his contract
and give him first choice of any illusion
he designs.price is already ill disposed toward rinaldi
as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi .
he deploys his talent as an illusionist and as a illiant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and other
who thwart his plan for recognition as a performer and a designer.price is pretty much the whole show here
and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man
whose predicament earns audience sympathy.the rest of the cast are competent
if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price
who carries the burden with ease .good solid b movie melodrama ,
this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture
and is enjoyable providing you do not expect a masterpiece .shot in black and white
it is low on gore
and is best seen as melodrama
and enjoyed for the presence of its star
giving an idiosyncratic performance
