intelligent 
wry 
and thrilling 
`` the invisible man '' stood out in 2000 among sci-fi 's usual lineup ,
balancing out `` farscape '' 's fantastical art direction
and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty 
cynical plot and modern noir dialogue .
the show sat between `` law and order '' and `` doctor who '' on the believability meter ,
but there was no denying the fact
that `` i-man '' 's character went beyond caricature .
even character that verged on predictability like the keeper 
the official 
and ebert were given reprieve from the formulaic .
paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry
that evolved and shifted elegantly ,
made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writer and director .
the effect are never allowed to overwhelm the plot ,
and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable .
the show 's low point are still entertaining ,
and i have never seen such taut pilot episode .
matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended ,
and fan have the right
to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show .
every time i come across a marathon of `` hercule :
the legendary journeys '' on sci-fi 
i roll my eye and sigh 
mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television
that `` invisible man '' and its ilk represented .
