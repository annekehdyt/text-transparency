i do not know about you ,
but what i love about tom and jerry cartoon is the
( often violent )
interaction between the two character .
mouse in manhattan see jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york ,
and as far as i am concerned ,
this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat !
as magical as jerry 's exploration of the 'big apple ' might be for the other tandj fan
who have commented here on imdb ,
i could not wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end ,
so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd.in fact 
the only part of the whole episode
that i genuinely enjoyed was
when jerry almost 'buys the farm ' ,
hanging precariously off the end of a oken candle 
hundred of foot above a busy road .
