reading a wide variety of `` scoop '' reviews over the past few day ,
i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody .
happily 
i could not have been more wrong .
granted 
woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two ,
but woody the writer/director is in fine form -
and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story .
judging from the laughter and guffaws 
the audience ate up allen 's one-liner and dialogue in a way
that i have not seen in several year .
in a movie landscape
dominated by software-approved story arcs 
twentysomething taste and assembly-line formula fare for kiddy ,
it is a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen
pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path .
