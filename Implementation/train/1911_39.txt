i saw this bomb
when it hit theater .
i laughed the whole time .
why ?
because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane .
i look back on it
and realize
there was not one funny thing in the whole movie .
at leat nothing intentional .
it is awfully funny
that lizzie cn chew a piece of nurplex and become a gigantic 
carnivorous demon ...
yet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact ,
despite the fact
that she is now hundred of time larger
than she was when she first put it on .
or the kind of movie
in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious ,
and return to conciousness
without any medical attention .
and do not let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the `` villain ''
that
they decided they needed
to create `` conflict . ''
uh huh.to the person
complaining about disney only targetting kids-the raunchy part of this film
seems to disprove that statement .
do we really need daryl hannah accusing jeff bridge
of having kinky video tape ?
you do
if you are disney
and you are out of idea
for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd
without writing a more intelligent script !
i am thoroughly convinced
that disney pays off the rating board
so it is movie
can get away with murder
and still get family-friendly rating.what a waste of the dvd format .
