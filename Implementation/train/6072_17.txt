watching `` der himmel \u00fcber berlin ''
as a teen in the late 80 's was a profound experience for me -
`` so this was what
the movie could be '' .
along with `` paris 
texas '' and `` until the end of the world '' it still holds a special place in my heart
and mind - a testament to the genius of wim wender.unfortunately later year has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with `` million dollar hotel '' and `` land of plenty ''
hitting a terrible low point .
gone are the captivating picture or music .
no search for or display of great insight .
all
that is left
are character and thinly veiled political statement ,
that boils down to nothing but clich\u00e9s ,
and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience.has the well run dry ?
whatever the reason ,
it is time for mr. wender to either step it up or stop altogether .
