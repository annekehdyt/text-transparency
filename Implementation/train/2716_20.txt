with nothing better to do i decided to check out `` aztec rex ''
( as it was being billed )
for the hell of it.the silly story might have played better
if the dinosaur effect were convincing .
they actually looked like animatic
( those rough design
that artists later use
to finish the cgi effect ,
adding more detail 
smoother movement 
etc . )
absolutely awful-looking dinosaur ,
which is the only reason
you would probably want to sit through this anyway.the one redeeming factor
was the lovely dichen lachman as ayacoatl .
she kept my interest ;
if only the budget had been ramped up
and some convincing dinosaur could have been used.disappointing .
at least the cast and crew got a free trip to hawaii ,
where the movie was filmed .
