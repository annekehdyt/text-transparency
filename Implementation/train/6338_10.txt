this is a wonderful film .
the non-stop patter takes several watching to fully appreciate .
the musical production of busby berkeley will never be duplicated .
i think
this movie easily outdoes all of his other effort .
joan blondell and jame cagney are incredible together .
some of the humor would almost push the boundary of today 's movie .
put rational explanation of how they did it aside
and enjoy it for the spectacle
that it is .
