this film is so bad ,
you can not imagine .
the acting is terrible ,
even worse than in third class soap opera .
an it is a shame
that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 year in switzerland .
the interaction between the soldier did not make any sense at all .
the story could have been taken out from a avo photo-story ,
the dialogue were as wooden as treebeard
and the plot hole were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy .
but nowadays it does not need much to satisfy the audience .
the actor were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung
( woah ! ! )
and there certainly was much abuse of drug .
that is real cool man !
particularly for 12 and 13 year old teen .
but the medium created an atmosphere in witch you
was not allowed to reject the film
because they manipulated the peer group
dynamic by telling implicitly
that you are a nerd
if you do not go along with the other `sheep ' and say.ye
that is exactly what it was like
when i was in the army/
that is exactly what i am going to do
when i must go to the army.. to every cheesy action
that had to do with drug and coolness .
and do not think i like the army .
i was there
and i hated it
but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth ush
( which i was forced to do
because i offended an lieutenant )
it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated .
sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hour and forget about problem
and i think its not a bad thing .
but this kind of film influence teenager to much by showing them a cool lifestyle
which in fact is only stupid
and turns them into ainless ignorant and egocentric idiot .
but since i now that my opinion is not very popular i will be quiet now
and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any cost
and for that to save your wit ! 2/10
( sorry for my bad english )
