as b movie go 
it was well above average
( i warn the reader now
that i may reveal certain key element of the plot or other part of the movie ,
although i am trying to minimise any such tendency ) .
as sequel usually go ,
it was utterly fantastic
( despite a `` cookie cutter '' approach
to trying to copy certain element from the original movie verbatum .
despite this sometime tedious tendency ,
it seemed to work in this particular film ,
so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparison to the original `` scanner '' )
.the movie was similar in way to the `` superman '' series 
in term of the main character 's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parent
( who seemed modelled along the same line as the kent in the `` superman '' story )
and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary power from an early age 
etc .
the depiction of profound feeling of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming child 
adolescent and/or adult was a theme
which reminded me of film such as `` real genius '' ,
and ( to a more superficial degree )
`` doctor mordrid ''
and struck a particularly strong chord.the film had a positive message ,
and was fun to watch .
i found some of the insight and accuracy
( in term of depiction of certain aspect of paranormal experience )
fascinating ,
and even profoundly touching at time .
these moment occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex
( uality 
in this case ,
as the sexual element were tastefully done )
and violence
that makes b movie
( or shakespearian play ,
for that matter ! )
so much fun to watch !
this is a must watch for all comic book 
sci-fi 
`` remote viewing '' enthusiast 
and horror fan !
with the right exposure in the right circle 
the film could develop quite a cult following 
along with the original `` scanner '' .
