whenever i see most reviews
it is called 'a misfire for eddie murphy ' .
these critic want to take a look at some of the stuff
he is doing these day ,
and maybe soften their stance in retrospect ... `` the golden child '' is not highow entertainment ,
but thank to some of the cast it eaths new life into old clich\u00e9s ,
and gives murphy one of his best role .
i do not understand the pervading lack of 'love ' for its effort 
at all .
perhaps it was released at a time
when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout 
thrill-a-minute adventure ?
steven spielberg started it with indiana jone ;
it is unfair to make this one a scapegoat
when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless .
there is nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trend.ye
it is silly ,
but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous ' is where hollywood 's idea of mysticism begin and end .
what is more important than believability with a story like this
is that the audience have entertaining tour guide on hand
to show them the mysterious sight .
michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine .
my advice to you is to buy the ticket
and take the ride .
