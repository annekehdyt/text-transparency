just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival ,
and enjoyed it thoroughly.great writing and direction 
excellent and believable interaction among the cast ,
and great comic timing as well.this movie touch on theme
that are universal-family and separation .
as a result 
i can see european 
asian ,
and american audience all finding point of similarity between this film and their own lives.if all
that was not enough ,
this has the potential
to be the best underground date movie of the year ...
somebody distribute this in the usa 
please ! finally :
thank you maria flom !
it really is a great film .
