the crime scene are very utal and haunting
because of the lack of sense and reason for what we witnessed .

amazing performance in two principal role from robert blake and scott wilson and first time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moment before their death .
jone

gripping 
superbly directed and frightening 
one of the best film of this decade
