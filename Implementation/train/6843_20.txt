spoiler i guess .
the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie .
i just could not get over it .
and what is wrong with mark wahlberg 's character ?
if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes ,
i would be all like 
`` aaaahhhhhhh ! ! !
run for your life !
the monkey have inherited the earth ! ''
but he is all like ,
`` talking apes 
okay .
next ? ''
that is pretty jaded i would say .
he must run into even stranger thing on a regular basis .
besides that 
this is rick baker 's best work yet .
this film is a true testament
to how far we have come in the monkey makeup field .
3/10 .
