some person seem to think this was the worst movie
they have ever seen ,
and i understand
where they are coming from ,
but i really have seen worse.that being said 
the movie
that i can recall
( ie the one i
have not blocked out )
that were worse than this ,
were so bad
that they physically pained every sense
that was involved with watching the movie .
the movie
that are worse
than war game 2 are the one
that make you want to gouge out your eye 
or stab sharp object in your ears
to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul
ripped away from you by the awfulness.war game :
the dead code is not that bad ,
but it comes pretty close .
yes i was a fan of the original ,
but no i was not expecting miracle from this one .
let 's face
it the original was not really that great of a movie in the first place ,
it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.that is all i was hoping for 
something bad ,
but that might have tugged at my geek-string .
was that too much to ask for ?
is it really not possible to do better than the original war game 
even for a straight to video release ?
well apparently
that was too much to ask for .
stay away from this movie .
at first it is just bad 
like `` oh yeah 
this is bad ,
but i am kind
of enjoying it ,
maybe the end will be good like in the original . ''
and then it just gets worse and worse ,
and by the end 
trust me ,
you will wish
you had not seen this movie .
