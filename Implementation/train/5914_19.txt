i saw this film back at the 2005 palm spring international festival and of the 14 film i saw
there i would rank this # 4.
the 900+ theater was full and at the end
it received a standing ovation .
this was classic peter falk
if you are a falk fan
and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter falk and paul reiser character .
the film 's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me .
i am surprised
this did not make it into general release .
this was far better than the majority of junk
that the major studio throw at you .
maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience .
a lot of person could relate to situation in this movie .
this will probably enjoy a revival of sort year from now
when person look back at this film
and consider it a kind of a gem .
i would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10
and definitely recommend it .
