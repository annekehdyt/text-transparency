there are no person like `` show person '' marion davy
( as peggy pepper )
and william haine
( as billy boone ) .
my introduction to ms. davy was a `` clip '' from this film ;
the delightfully spoofy one
in which she lowers a scarf
to reveal different emotion .
my introduction to mr. haine was in viewing this film 
presently ;
though ,
it is possible
i have seen him in a less memorable role .
haine makes an incredible impression ,
when he joins davy for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bit at the dining table .
indeed 
haine and davy deliver great comic performances.the story starts off with dell henderson
( colonel pepper )
driving daughter davy into hollywood 
certain
she will become tinseltown 's newest sensation .
indeed 
davy and the already arrived haine become comedy star .
but 
davy yearns to become a true drama queen .
davy leaves haine ,
and partner up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli .
but 
audience prefer davy in more comic role ;
perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life ?
full of great hollywood location footage 
both on the set 
and off .
full of great `` cameo '' ; at a studio lunch 
at the star ' table 
davy sit between dougla fairbank and william s. hart .
the best `` bit '' player 
however 
is charlie chaplin ,
who has enough nerve to ask davy for her autograph !
while the cameo are fun ,
they 
and the episodic sequence 
do help `` show person '' become less of an important film 
and more of an important historical document .
