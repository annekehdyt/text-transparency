if you want to watch something
that is for 'him ' and 'her '
so to say
then this is the film to pick .
i am a sucker for rom com
but my husband is not always so keen
( what a guy ! ! ! ) .
anyway i managed to get him to watch it
because i told him it was about sport ,
and you know what ,
he loved it ! !
! drew barrymore is very funny and her leading man
( sorry but can not remember his name )
is equally as good .
when i watched the film
it was called 'the perfect match '
but i think
the title was changed for the uk
as it is based on the book fever pitch
and there was already a film made about football with that title
( the same film but the uk version - phew !
) 
anyway all of the review on here will tell you more detail
if you need them buy girl ,
take it from me ,
get your hubby/boyfriend in front of the television on a saturday night
and you will both laugh and cry together .
a real gem .
