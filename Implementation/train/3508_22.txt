to summarize this movie :
without a real plot ,
this movie consists of 80 minute of deranged character
either drinking or making bad joke .
the music is just awful ,
the humor is not funny and all the female character slutty idiot or total geek .
it seems to me ,
that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy ,
who thinks
that drinking is cool ,
woman are designed to please man and all
that oppose
that view are geek .
also 
the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movie 
other than a few name and mr. levenstein
who is a minor character in this one .
the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girl .
do not watch this movie
and do not be fooled by the 5.4 rating ,
because it obviously overrated
and does not deserve anything above 2 .
