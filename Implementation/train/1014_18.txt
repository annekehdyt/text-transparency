tea leoni plays nora wilde 
a serious photographer ,
who is going through a bad divorce .
she wants her freedom
but it comes at a cost .
she wants to legitimate photography
but is hired to work for the tabloid as a paparazzi .
her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor .
the show was well-written most of the time .
tea 's nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character
but the network just did not support comedy
and they still do not .
even when they ought in george wendt from cheer ,
they made unnecessary change in casting and character .
the show was fine in the beginning
and the audience was getting used
to it
but then the network botch it up like a bad plastic surgery .
