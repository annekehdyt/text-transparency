i read schneebaum 's book
( same title as this film )
when it was first published
and was deeply moved by his ability
to see through the many way of `` otherness ''
( his own and the person of the amazon with whom he lived and loved )
to a way
of living a decent life .
his subsequent book were not as powerful ,
but showed his continuing quest .
his description of his sexual relation with the man of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60 's 
but his honesty and openness about it were welcome .
this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man ,
but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence
( which is not a morally positive term 
in this case )
that occurs when `` civilized '' man intrude on traditional society .
even so 
schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence
that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness .
