charlotte 's deadly beauty and lethal kick make the movie cooler
than it would be otherwise.the story is so poor and charlotte 's character dies in such a foolish way ,
that you wonder
if this 's the ending
they had thought of for this movie .
i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exist ,
but i fear it does not .
as for the rest of the cst 
well i would say
they simply did not act very well ;
although the blame should be put on the poor script.this movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way 
since she had been the only one
who had stolen the show during the whole movie .
i could give this movie 2/5
