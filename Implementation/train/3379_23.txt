ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time .
believe
me i saw a lot of movie and comedy
but tell me
which one make you smile every time
you watching it .
but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special.it is caratherisic for serbia .
and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well ! ! !
so i think
the rest of audience
( for example :
in europe )
can not enjoy it so much .
because the subtitle ruin the hole thing .
but they should at least try ! ! ! !
yes it is ironic !
this is the best flick in serbian history
and the world does not understand it !

if you have got a chance
to see this one ,
do not blew up ok !
