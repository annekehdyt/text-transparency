i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california
when this movie came out .
as good
as it is on dvd ,
it is even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen .
although it has been about 9 year
since i have seen it ,
it is still one of my all-time favorite .
at the risk of sounding trite 
`` they just do not make 'em like this anymore ! ''
if sixth sense freaked you out at all ,
this movie is definitely for you !
great storyline 
incredible cast of character 
ominous setting ;
even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it .
i highly recommend you not watch it alone .
what a ownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone ,
will have you gasping
( it would be at least 10-time that price today ) .
