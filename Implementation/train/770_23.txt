and possibly closest to the dicken story line .
although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch
( who 's idea
was that period hair ,
surely they could have done better than that !
) 
scott does an incredible job as scrooge .
his delivery of some of the line from dicken finally ought it to life for me .
edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present .
i find g.c .
scott 's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart .
the scene christmas morning
when scrooge realizes he has not 'missed it ' ,
is enough
to convince one
that scott knows how to act versus overact .
he is phenomenal here .
nearly the entire cast is incredible .
the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough
to look at 
almost too sweet .
still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday .
enjoy !
