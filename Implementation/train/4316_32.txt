ever since i can remember
and i am only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movie
because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run
( but hey do not get me wrong i do love the movie
we have today
just not as much as i love movie of the 40s and 50s ) anyway ,
now i have to say
the moment i started
watching the movie my eye were glued to the tv .
of course my favorite character was the grandmother
played by lucile watson .
but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed .
the child ... did not act like child in the slightest .
but there is good reason for that ,
having had to hid and run most of your life ,
seeing the awful thing child
saw those day
destroyed their innocence .
so person saying
`` oooo i hated how the kid acted ... blah blah blah '' read between the line
and know
they saw thing child should not see.paul lukas ... dear paul did an amazing job ! ! !
now i know
many person are mad
that he go the oscar and bogie did not but hey they both did amazing job so i think
it could have gone either way .
but lukas ' performance was so amazing
that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tear .
i loved this movie so much
and recommend it to anyone ! !
