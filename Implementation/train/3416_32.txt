let me start by saying
that i consider myself to be one of the more
( most !
) open-minded movie-viewer ... movie are my passion ,
and i am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place ... i also feel the need
to add
that they often ask me for advice about movie
whenever i get there ,
and i never seem to be able to leave the place
without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of idea
about what is going on in the cult-movie-area ... i love to rent strange stuff ,
and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guy at the cult-movie-video-place.he told me
he thought
i had to see this ,
and since the cover said
something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky
( one of my favorite !
) atmosphere ,
i rented it.the vote i gave here is not really fair ,
because i did not think
it was awful ,
i just did not know how to rate it otherwise .
a question mark would have been more appropriate ...
this is the first and only film
that literally made me sick to my stomach :
i actually felt physically ill !
am i the only one whose stomach literally turned ?
still i did not want to turn it off ,
or maybe i just could not because i was fascinated in a nasty way ...
i do not ever wan na see this movie again.not awful 
a 1 as i said.just not my cup of tea
( or wodka for that matter ) ...
