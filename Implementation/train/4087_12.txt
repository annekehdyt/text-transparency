this is one of the most boring movie i
have ever seen 
its horrible .
christopher lee is good
but he is hardly in it ,
the only the good part is the opening scene.do not be fooled by the title .
`` end of the world '' is truly a bad movie ,
i stopped watching it close to the end
it was so bad ,
only for die hard b-movie fan
that have the ain
to stand this vomit .
