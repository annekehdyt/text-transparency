i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment ,
but it was just boring .
it appears
that the producer had many biker enthusiast friend ,
and from there casually decided to make a movie .
it is frequently unwatchable .
lot of footage of the biker riding on a dirt road ,
with the same music played repeatedly .
unfortunately 
renee harmon is barely in the movie .
harmon probably would have livened thing up .
perhaps she had other commitment
the day this was filmed.of course 
the biker terrorize a small town .
fight 
murder 
a cowardly cop 
a goofy mechanic 
etc .
one of the biker always wears a football helmet 
a weak attempt
to distinguish him from all the other outlaws.the script
has nothing to offer .
one scene features a biker assaulting a woman ,
yelling in the lady 's face `` you are all the same !
you are all the same ! `` .
we come back to the scene a minute later
and he again declares
`` you are all the same ! `` .
could not the writer think of something more creative to say ?
? at the end the good guy have killed the bad guy .
we also learn
that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic joe and young susie has been canceled .
susie is going away to college ,
and we auptly learn
that joe 's wedding is still on ( but with a different ide ) .
end .
