this has to be the most utally unfunny `` comedy ''
i have ever seen in my life .
ben stiller 
jack black 
and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can not make me laugh ?
something 's got to be wrong with this picture .
this is the only movie i have ever felt like walking out of .
i used free pass ,
and still felt like i wanted my money back .
i can wholeheartedly say
that the only movie i have ever seen worse
than this one was house of the dead .
the .
only .
worse .
movie .
i laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene ,
and that is it .
spending 2 hour in something
billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh 
right ?
i do not know ,
i guess the filmmaker thought
that `` flan '' was a funny word 
or something .
and the other running joke really is beating a dead horse
-- literally .
