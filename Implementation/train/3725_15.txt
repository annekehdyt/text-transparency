`` inspirational '' tale about `` triumph of the human spirit '' are usually big turn-off for me .
the most surprising thing about man of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself .
the movie is as predictable and cliched
as it gets ,
but it works .
much credit goes to the exhilarating performance by both lead .
it is a perfect role for cuba gooding 
jr. ,
who 's wonderfully restrained here .
we have come to expect a lot from de niro ,
and he does not disappoint .
he creates a darkly funny portrait .
director george tillman 
jr. set out to make an old-style flick
and comes up with a winner .
