i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hour of my life
actually watching this film ,
i still can not believe i managed to watch it in its entirety .
was there actually a point to the film ? ,
and the ending 
well 
im glad i never paid
to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film ! im
not sure
without hunting the fact out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life ,
if so was it an attempt
to kick start her career ? ,
if so im afraid it must have failed..i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film ,
even if 1 person takes heed of my comment
and decide
they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel
i have made some good in the world ,
if only i had had the same advice ...
