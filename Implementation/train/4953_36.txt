during the early 1980 's 
kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united state .
inevitably 
man in his position get offered film role
that exist solely to capitalize on that .
i have no idea
what thomas was paid
to make this film ,
but i would have to be paid a big heap of money
to agree to make a national fool
of myself in a motion picture .
the film is obviously derived from `` enter the dragon 
''
as are most martial art picture .
only instead of a real martial art ,
they concoct an absurd new martial art ,
accurately described by one critic as `` a cross between kung fu and eak dancing . ''
a gymnast
( thomas 
of course )
is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress ,
yet every room has a prop
that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddy .
of course 
he fights his way to the lead villain ,
and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight ,
with an ending
that will surprise only those
who have never seen a marshal art film .
there are touch
which nostalgic type will like 
particularly the mullet haircut of thomas and many of the male co-star have .
but the only reason
to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas ,
who now wishes
he had never set foot on the film set .
