today 
i visited an athenean cinema with my two kid
( 6 and 8 year old ) 
payed 3 x 12 euro
( about 45 us $ total )
not to mention gas 
popcorn and soda ,
was asked to return my 3d special glass
after leaving the theater
and was `` forced '' to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece
but only proved to be a sick `` cold war like '' propaganda movie ,
like none i have seen during the last 20 year ...
and this is supposed to be a movie for child ... in heaven 's name !
ps 1 :
the average working greek makes no more than 850 euro a month
( approxiamtely 1050 us $ )
ps 2 my kid liked it ...
but then again
they are no more than baby > in greek :
mora 
moron > like the one
who wrote the script and the other
who made this `` 3d disgrace '' happen.ps 3 3d animation
is fantastic
but who gives a ... . !
