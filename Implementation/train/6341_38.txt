this is an interesting treatment of a subject
that is quite controversial ,
( just read the other comment on this film ) .
apparently 
you either love it or hate it
and it seems most person make
that distinction based
on whether they believe
the tribulation and end time will happen as portrayed in the movie.basically ,
the film - and its sequel - were made for about $ 1.30 each .
the production value are right down there with `` plan 9 from outer space ''
and the acting is about on the same level as `` glen or glenda '' ,
( my apology to ed wood ) .
putting aside the religious message ,
the story is as scary
as they come .
add in even the slightest thought
that the story might actually be close to something
that might happen in the future
and it becomes even scarier.this movie ,
and its sequel 
did not try to ing in the reason
why the tribulation happened
when it did .
`` left behind '' and `` the omega code '' tried to get in everything `` thief '' did
and to explain all the politic and maneuvering in the middle east leading up to it .
the net effect was `` thief '' did a much better job on the scary part of movie ,
instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain
what was happening in the middle east at the same time .
forget the politic and watch this movie ,
and its sequel 
for what they are - horror story .
that they may be horror story told ,
indirectly 
by god makes them just that much more frightening .
if it makes you think about the subject ,
it has done its job -
even if you never believe .
