i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews year ago
and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption.although
it is been year since i read the story the first time ,
the difference between the novel and the movie are humongous .
very important element ,
which made the whole thing plausible
are just written out or changed
to bad.if the plot sounds interesting
to you :
go and get the novel .
its much 
much 
much better.still 4/10
since it
was hard to stop watching
because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich .
