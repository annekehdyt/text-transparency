the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience .
it is a slow-moving but fascinating film for those
who are willing to go along with it .
an australian property lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigine
accused in the murder of one of their own .
all sort of portent and omen soon pop up 
as the man 's death involves a tribal issue
that was not meant for white man 's court ,
and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy .
it looks like the end of the world may be at hand ,
and he and the aborigine may know this but no one else does .
richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here .
david guptil 
a familiar face from several other australian flick and a decent actor 
is one of the five aborigine on trial .
the last wave is simply not for everyone 
anymore than is magnolia
( both happen to have strange thing falling from the sky ) .
check it out on a slow saturday night .
