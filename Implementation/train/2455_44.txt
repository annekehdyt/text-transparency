i originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable tv .
what a surprise and delight !
everyone is covertly armed in this movie !
dreyfuss plays the `` mental '' don
( remember the new york don
who was supposed to be schizophrenic ?
art imitates life or vice-versa ? ) .
diane lane and ellen barkin are at their most beautiful
and not to be toyed with !
thus proving
that beauty and toughness do go together !
then there is the great `` bullshit '' scene between barkin and jeff goldblum
( rita and mickey )
where they verbally play off the world `` bullshit . ''
this film is both subtle and bald .
for all the shooting ,
it can be a very quiet film .
and 
you have the opportunity
to see several actor in their final or near final role .
joey bishop .
richard pryor .
henry silva .
it is not a film for everyone .
but 
if you like a film
that has a lot of word play
and keeps moving
without blowing up everything in sight ,
this is the film for you .
roger ebert dump on this film .
he is flat wrong .
this is a fine 
fine film !
maybe just not one for ebert .
i consider it as a 10
because of how well it is done
and how funny the script can be ,
while not really being a straight comedy kind of film .
i like it so well
that i bought it on dvd
because it just does not get shown very much on cable tv .
now 
it is all mine !
