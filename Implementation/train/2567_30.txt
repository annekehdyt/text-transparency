i have just purchased the restored version of a film
that i remember with much affection from childhood
and it is certainly made for a curious afternoon 's entertainment .
bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form ,
the deleted scene
( especially those with mcdowall )
link event together quite neatly .
what is a little disconcerting is the way
the scene have been remastered .
clearly 
the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged ,
so some ight spark at disney decided to dub the scene with new dialogue .
which would have been great
except
that half the cast were not around
to do it
( some for better reason than other )
and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it .
some of the lip-synching is pretty poor ,
and david tomlinson 's voice has been dubbed by a bloke
who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson
( there is actually a hint of german in it ,
i think ) .
however 
good to hear the full version of all the song
( although 'step in the right direction ' is still absent )
and the moment of magic in this film still shine through .
and i challenge you not to giggle
when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos
`` but what is that got to do with my knob ? ? ''
