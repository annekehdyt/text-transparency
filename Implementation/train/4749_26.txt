i had such high hope for this film
because i loved the original so much .
it seems
that disney 
however 
is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-dvd sequel .
they deserve a razzie .
several 
in fact .
i thought
the idea had merit ,
but the music was absolutely awful
and the story was not much better .
what happened to the great music disney used to have in their film .
mary poppin 
aladdin 
beauty and the beast 
the lion king ... even hercule and the hunchback of notre dame .
they have made so many great movie over the year
that it is really sad
that they have sunk to point
of making sequel
that are not even good enough
to put in theatres.i hope this movie
is not an indication of thing
to come for the walt disney corporation .
