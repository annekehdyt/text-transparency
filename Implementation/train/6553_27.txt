this movie was exactly what i expected it to be
when i first read the casting .
i probably could have written a more exciting plot ,
it is a pity
that they left it to a pack of howler monkey .
alberto tomba was surely a good skier
but he has to thank god
( and we too )
that he does not have to rely on his actor skill to earn his living .
he can not play ,
he can not talk ,
he can not even move very good on mainland
without his skis ... michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl ,
and that is all .
she obviously was not chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic role but most probably for her nice legs .
nevertheless i must admit
that she could be the tomba 's acting teacher ,
because he is even a worse actor than her ,
and that is funny ,
especially considering
that she is not italian .
i laughed all the time ,
watching this movie .
i found it so ridiculous and meaningless
that it actually made me laugh 
loud 
very loud .
