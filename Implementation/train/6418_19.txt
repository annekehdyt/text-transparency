did you ever wonder
how far one movie could go ?
schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo .
harry is an aggravated writer 
killer and drug addict scumbag
who will stop at nothing to destroy those
who stand between him and insanity .
driven by the demonic voice of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck ,
harry begins his killing spree .
from director ron atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever
to be filmedthe
only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled schizophreniac necromaniacthis is a really low budget film
and will not be for everyone ,
but
if you are looking for something disturbing ,
different and horrific then this would make a fine choice.do
not expect anything like modern day horror
( such as scream )
viewer discretion is advised
