i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :
- ) .
it is nothing more than compilation of element of few other classic title like the thing 
final fantasy 
the abyss etc .
framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario .
i really can not figure out what was the purpose
of creating this movie -
it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline
which additionally is also senseless .
moreover there is nothing to watch - the fx'es look
like there were taken from a second hand store ,
you generally saw all of them in other movie .
but it is definitely a good lullaby .
