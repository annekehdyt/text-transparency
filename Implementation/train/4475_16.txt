as most off you might off seen star war :
return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie
but as you might have seen on video
they m|might have a party at the end
and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirit or anything but on the original one
( live tv ) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dy in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dy from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader
( real name :
anakin skywalker )
when they all are partying at the end
when luke or someone stops the spirit off ben and yoda stand
starring at him and smiling
while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon
that made the movie
ending a little bit interesting
but the producer or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis
that got killed with youngling under there arm in the back ground
