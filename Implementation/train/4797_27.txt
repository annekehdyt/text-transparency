predictable 
told a thousand time story with the usual drama in between 
a couple of pretty raunchy sex scene intermingled with some character paranoia 
70 's style incidental violin horror music
that is comical at time ,
i could not help chuckling to myself.i usually like defoe ,
and it has to be said
that the acting is not all that bad ,
the `` plot '' develops at a reasonable pace
and does keep you guessing from time to time .
its just
that it is all too predictable ,
i felt
like i was watching a made for tv drama
instead of a new movie .
maybe thats the style the director wanted ,
but it has to be said
that the review i read on here
before i saw the movie
could only have been written by someone
involved in its production.do
not expect too much ,
and if i could wind the clock back i would not have gone
to see it at the cinema .
i would wait for the bargain bin at your video shop ,
i am sure
it wont take long .
