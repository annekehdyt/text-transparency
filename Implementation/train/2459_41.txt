i watched part one two day ago
and today i saw part two .
of course the two part are worlds apart
so i am a little shaken by all
that i just saw .
i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che is death ;
for me 
it clouded the entire movie .
i suppose
that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel ,
the slowly evolving inevitability of his death .
part two was so downbeat
compared to ,
again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive
and in bolivia it was so negative .
the politic of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically .
for me the memorable scene were all at the end of the film :
the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where
that official question che about the failure of the peasant
to support his revolution .
i had not considered the national difference
playing as much role
as they did in the conflict 
argentine versus bolivian .
i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problem of supply in a revolutionary struggle ;
how do you get food
without antagonizing the peasant
who do not have enough themselves .
i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried .
i guess
it is all in the timing ;
is there sufficient anger against the government
to begin the movement ;
in bolivia there was not .
che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionist in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film :
if not now 
when 
50 year from now .
a very thought provoking and well done film ;
make every effort
to see it .
