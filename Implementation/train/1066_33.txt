i am surprised
no-one has thought
of doing a movie like this before .
horror is often most effective
when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme .
and nobody
( except for steve martin in the little shop of horror )
likes going to the dentist .
tooth torture has been done
before ( see the marathan man for example ) ,
but this ings the terror into suburbia.the plot revolves around a dentist 
dr. alan feinstone
( corbin bernsen ) ,
who descends into madness .
now our dear doctor was not playing with a full deck
to begin with ,
but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder
he begins to reek havoc on those around him .
the doctor spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas 's character in falling down ,
but with a horror edge.written and directed by horror stalwart stuart gordon and brian yuzna 
its witty and has a great flow .
also featured playing a cop ,
is the ever welcome ken foree.now i believe
this movie would not work
without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen .
having really only seen him in la law before ,
i was blown away by his acting.the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching 
but slightly under par
compared to the original.ttkk 's bottomline - a fun movie with some scene
that will make you cringe 
capped
( pun intended )
by a great performance from bernsen
