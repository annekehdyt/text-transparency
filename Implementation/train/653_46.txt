i guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of `` beauty and the beast '' ,
but i can not say
i have ever watched a movie
that began with several minute of graphic horse sex .
wow .
anyway it seems that a young woman and her..aunt ?
have traveled to this castle in france
where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner ,
who is the man
who takes care
of making sure the horse get their rock off .
it seems that there are legend in that area of a beast
that was rather 
uh 
frisky ,
i guess
you could say 
with the lady 
or at least 
one in particular .
there are all kind of reference tucked away
in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young ide gets her curious little hand on one the groom 's father removes it from her sight .
anyway 
the young ide-to-be goes upstair to sleep
while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding
( a family member 
i guess )
and as she dreams
she dreams of a beast in the wood
that has its way with her .
the effect in this leave a little
to be desired ,
and any attempt at eroticism
( not that i know much about that )
is kind of rendered laughable ,
especially when certain featured appendage appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat .
this has a rather strange and aupt 
yet twist ending ,
with not really any clue or much build up to it ,
but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected .
i do not know ,
this is kind of a tough one
to get through
but it has its moment
and is definitely weird .
7/10 .
