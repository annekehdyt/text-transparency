this is one of the worse
case of film drivel i have seen in a long while .
it is so awful ,
that i am not sure where to begin ,
or even if it is worth it .
the plot is the real problem ,
and i feel sorry for 'sly '
as he puts in a decent performance for his part .
but that plot ... oh dear oh dear .
i particularly love the way
near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top ,
whilst the helicopter is on the way .
a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minute !
i could go on :
but it is not worth it .
apart from the grim opening
( which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of )
the rest is drivel .
sorry folk 
but this is about as bad
as film
making gets .
