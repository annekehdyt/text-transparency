after seeing only half of the film in school back in november 
today ,
i saw
that it was on flix channel
and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.the book
that the film is based on 
hatchet 
is ok. this is a terrible adaption of it though.awful
( and i mean awful )
acting 
bad dialogue 
and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchet.the film
starts off brian
who is the clich\u00e9 image of a late 80s teen
( sporting a mullet 
banging his head to cheap 80s rock music )
and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane
to fly up
to see his estranged dad
( his parent are divorced ...
now cue the dramatic pause . )
now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father .
the pilot is a fat 
ugly 
rude man
( was not like that in the book )
who after 2 minute in the air ,
has a heart attack and dy .
in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot
having more pain
and it seemed to be that
they were in the air much longer
before the pilot had his heart attack.the plane
( within another two minute ) has gone empty on fuel
( leaving us 
the viewer ,
to assume
that he is been up there for hour
even though the sun has not changed position
and the scenery looks exactly the same . )
now 's he is crashed landed.this is the point in the movie
where everything is a lot different
then it was in the book .
in the book it said
his jacket was torn to shred but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tear or rip
( looks like he just bought it ) ,
it never said
he climbed a mountain ,
saw a wolf ,
and fell asleep up there on the mountain ,
it never said
he was attacked by a bear ( it said a moose but not a bear ) ,
it never said
he eats the several bug
that he does 
it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrow ,
skin them ,
and eat them or that little fish farm trap
that he makes
( that is destroyed by one of the tornado )
nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornado.i do
not even think
you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado .
all it was was just a windstorm
that knocked down several of his thing.my favorite part of this camp fest was brian 's lame flashback
( that are never mentioned in the book )
especially the clich\u00e9 scene of brian waking up 
walking over to the window
and seeing his dad
( with all of his thing packed
that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck )
leaving and screams `` daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddd ! ! ! ! ''
( yet of course his father did not hear him even though he was just right outside )
and he punches his fist through the window
( wtf ? )
the ending is the only thing
that is close to what happened in the book
( i said close . )
in the book i think one of the key thing
that the rescue pilot said to brian
when he landed was `` you are the kid
who they have been looking for !
they stopped month ago ... ''
yet they left
that line out in the movie.there is a pathetic epilogue with brian
( somehow
without counseling or therapy )
getting back to normal with his family .
i think
we were supposed to assume
that they were getting together for thanksgiving
( because they had a turkey on the counter . )
then it shows his temporary home
( for what 
in the movie 
seemed like three day ,
but in the book was for several month )
and his hatchet 
still in a tree
where he left it
( also did not happen in the book )
showing
where he carved a message ,
so perfectly done :
`` home ''
( where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet ? )
no quote can sum this movie up better
then
when enid from ghost world said
`` this is so bad
it is gone past good
and back to bad again . ''
perfect description of this movie.i would not recommend it to somebody
( who has not read the book )
and are just looking to watch a movie nor
would i to somebody
who has read the book
( because they will be disappointed and bored to death.for those
who have read the book ,
leave what your imagination
created as the movie .
this is awful
and will ing down your thought on the book.1/10
