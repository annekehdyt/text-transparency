ok 
i did not have high expectation
but this film descending into depth i could not imagine.the plot ,
as it were ,
involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order
investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater .
the sin eater allows for catholic to achive salvation outside the authority of the church
and is yet another immortal in film with load of ennui .
nevermind
that this makes no sense
since then a baptist could give you salvation ...
.we will move on.i
will layout the plot w/o
giving much away :
the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate .
he ings with him a mental patient
( i am not making this up )
who shot him during an excorism
and who loves him
( not one lick of this btw is explained ) ,
a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal .
they get to rome ,
find some creepy kid
who do nothing in the film ,
meet with a bondage gear sandm anti-pope
that the drunk irish guy know
( not explained )
and who gives information by killing person
( oh 
btw ,
he is a bad guy
so he has an industrial/techno soundtrack )
and then ... umm 
seriously 
i am not sure .
the plot meander about .
heath chill with the sin eater 
fly to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter
and then some other stuff happen and then
( all off camera )
the anti-pope fall and the film ends.about 1 hour into the film one really wonder
if anything has happened .
by the end something has happened
but you can not be at all certain
that it matters
and since most of the drama takes place
either before the movei or off-scren you are really feeling cheated .
