in my life i have seen many great and awful movie .
i am not an expert in professional review ,
but i have definitely something to say about this one .
firstly 
these actor are the worst i
have seen ...
their acting is so unreal
that you even want to throw away the dvd in the first 2 minute .
i think
that these actor were not interested in the quality .
another awful thing is about these dialog -
they are so lame .
you sometimes feel uncomfortable
when you hear them .
it seems
that your 14 year old son could act better .
i feel
that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old european car ... please ,
if my message reaches you - save your time and money .
