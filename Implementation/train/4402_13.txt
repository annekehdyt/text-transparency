while the acting and directing could be argued
as having some merit -
the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name
simply changed.at the very least 
for a movie
to hold some credibility ,
try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment 
weapon and tactic .
nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troop as a norm.aside for the limited use
as silly propaganda about the south african defence force ,
it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.aspiring movie maker - this is how not to make a war movie .
do some research ,
and have some pride in your product .
