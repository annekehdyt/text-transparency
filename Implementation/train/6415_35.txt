as a hammer completist i was dreading the time
when i would have to raise the courage
to watch this film
and the one
following it ,
holiday on the bus .
i had seen one the bus the film
and thought
it one of the worst film i have ever seen .
it was full of all the awful comedy
that plagued british tv screen around the early 70's.i am ashamed
to say
that there were actually part of this film
that i laughed at .
i do not know
if it was because i was now familiar with the character
and enjoyed some of the situation ,
knowing
how they would react .
i found blakey particularly funny ,
although i could swear at no point in the trilogy does
he say his catchphrase ,
`` i will get you butler '' .having watched holiday on the bus
the joke were starting to wear thin and these three film could be compared to an early hammer trilogy 
dick barton 
in that the second film made is the best
( although this is probably the only way
they could be compared )
.the only person
who would want to watch this film
are probably fan of the tv series ,
who will no doubt enjoy this ,
and hammer completist like myself .
to the completist i would say
that this film is not that bad and i can certainly think of worse hammer comedy .
