i am so disappointed .
this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy .
here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again :
the neurotic upper-class manhattanite debating
whether or not they will cheat on their spouse .
woody 
i have seen these character already ,
i have seen the storyline from you ten time already .
where did your creativity go ? ? ?
you need to open your eye and look around you .
the world has changed dramatically since annie hall -
and you need to change along with it.there are far more interesting and funny scenario
to which you can apply your and of angst and neuroticism -
why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.when i hear
that woody allen has a new project coming out ,
it does nothing for me -
because now i have come to expect his old standby :
the couple
who are growing
tired of each other and end up cheating .
depressing and same old 
same old.if woody wants to win his fan back ,
then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted .
