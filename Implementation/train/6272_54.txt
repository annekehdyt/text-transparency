i saw this movie for a number of reason
the main being mira sorvino .
with her on the cast it could not be so bad .
and it even seemed like
it had some mystery
and olivier martinez was her boyfriend at the time
and he was pretty good in `unfaithful ' .
the story is set in spain
so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses.if
you are thinking about the same thing
let me warn you :
this is a truly awful 
uninteresting 
boring movie .
the only adjective
that comes to mind
is pathetic.the story
is contrived with sub-plot
that add nothing to the narrative .
they try to build a slasher/thriller with a look at fascism in spain but fail horribly .
the twist have no credibility
and the so-called investigation leads nowhere.the character are paper-thin !
i did not care about anyone .
more than that they are irritating
and pretty hateful people.the acting is atrocious .
mira what is wrong with you ?
why mira ?
you are an oscar winner !
keep some dignity !
her character was weak
but that is no excuse for such an awful performance .
she seems to be sleepwalking all movie long .
come to think of it ,
i actually think
i saw her eye slowly closing in some scene .
i used to think
this woman was sexy .
well she is not here .
if you want to look at some skin try romi and michelle
because there is nothing to see here .
and that accent ?
my god ... olivier martinez is even worst .
it is too painful to remember his performance
to describe it here .
im sorry but i can\u00b4t .
ive suffered enough with this garbage.this whole movie
is depressing !
it is so bad in every way
it is a wonder
how it was even made .
a lousy team
to produce a lousy script
and make some money over the actor 's name .
do not fall for it.avoid it !
