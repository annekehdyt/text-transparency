rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist
( with yes 
a renfield-like assistant and his mother 
a dwarf and yes 
the scientist 's wife
( sounds like a greenaway movie
actually lol ) .
lugosi gives his wife injection from dead ide
( why them ?
who knows ? )
so that his wife can keep looking beautiful .
he gets the ide
after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchid
that makes the ide collapse at the altar .
after another ide bites the dust ,
a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop ,
and decide to snoop around for a story .
she gets all sort of clue about the orchid and lugosi .
heaven knows
where the police were .
soon she is off to bela 's lair ,
when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor
who may or may not be eeeevil .
it all cumulate in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding
to capture the mad scientist ,
but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision ,
as he foils her plan 
oh no !
what will happen ?
i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure .
lugosi is great here ,
his hangers-on are all very very strange ,
the story is actually quite nasty in some place
which makes it all most watchable .
a fun little view .
