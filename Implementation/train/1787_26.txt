philo vance
( william powell )
helps solve multiple murder among the wealthy
after a dog show.usually i hate overly convoluted mystery
( like this )
but i love this movie .
it moves very quickly
( only 72 minute ) ,
is beautifully directed by michael curtiz
( he uses ton of camera trick
that just speed the narrative along ) ,
has a very ingenious story line
( including a solution to a locked room murder
that was just incredible )
and has a very good cast .
powell is very suave and great as vance
-- he does not seem to be acting --
he is vance !
mary astor is not given much to do
but she adds class and beauty to the production .
everybody else is very good too ,
but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath .
he is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice
and some of his line were hilarious.basically 
an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery .
well worth seeing .
