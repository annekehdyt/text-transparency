`` enter the fat dragon '' is one of the funniest martial art movie
i had the opportunity
to see .
sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy
that comes to visit a city friend .
just like tang lung of `` way of the dragon . ''
wherever sammo goes 
trouble start ,
therefore he has to rely on his martial art skill
to solve the difference .
luckily 
sammo 's character learns martial art
by imitating and mimicking his idol 
bruce lee .
he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell .
he also uses nunchuck in a scene .
it was like watching a fat bruce lee .
there is a great showdown near the end of the movie
which consists of foreign fighter .
sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one .
sort of like `` the game of death '' ,
where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.this is one of the film i
really enjoyed watching
and also the very first sammo hung movie i have seen .
excellent fight scene and a lot of laugh .
a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all
you martial art fan out there .
8.5/10 !
