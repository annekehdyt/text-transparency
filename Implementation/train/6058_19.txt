when i rented this movie ,
i had very low expectation ... ...
but
when i saw it ,
i realized
that the movie was less
( a lot less )
than what i expected .
the actor were bad
( the doctor 's wife was one of the worst ) ,
the story was so stupid ...
it could work for a disney movie
( except for the murder ) ,
but this one is not a comedy ,
it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity .
the title is well chosen except for one thing :
they could add stupid movie
after dead husband !
i give it 0 and a half out of 5 .
