very bad movie ... ... ..and i mean very bad ...
the plot is predictable ,
and it is eally cheesy 
the creativeness of the battle and the dance scene for the time are the only reason
i did not give the movie a one 
other than that ... this is def a movie
one can def afford not to watch ... ..i feel
while watching the movie ,
the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clich\u00e9 ... .inging country bumpkin to the city blah blah blah ,
but i feel
it might have been at least a little better
if it just was not so cheesy ,
very poorly portrayed from idea to screen ,
i think .
the plot is somewhat predictable at time ,
tho the dancing i can say at time 
is pretty good ,
the eak dance battle twist was good ...
..if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scene
and make up your own dialog maybe
it can be a 5 ... lol
