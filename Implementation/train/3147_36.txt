first let me say
that before sunrise 
like all movie 
is not a movie for all taste .
it appears some folk are less smart to acknowledge this fact ,
but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generate from some person .
for me 
like most folk here ,
before sunrise struck a deep chord in me ,
i was truly stunned 
moved ,
inspired by it .
this is a movie
that ultimately benefit from more than one viewing .
it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feeling and emotion
you can possibly imagine .
it is impossible to imagine this world
without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feeling
i got from it.the movie works as a communion of two fragile soul
that are starting to get to know each other .
it is very intelligent and inspiring ,
not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topic of jesse and celine 's discussion 
but rather the little nuance 
the perfectly articulate response they provoke from each other .
it captures an honest 
romantic 
yet fleeting human emotion
that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu ;
it convinces us
that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world .
and what happens after that night is open for debate ,
but i never doubt
that they will not each other again.the facile comment by rockythebear
and the below user are hopeless example of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those
who love this movie.see it
and it may change your way of life .
