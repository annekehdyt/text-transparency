the story and the character were some of the best i
have ever seen .
the graphic were good for the ps and the cut scene and voice over were amazing .
i beat the game at least 3 time
and loved every second of it .
i felt the problem
the protagonist faced were believable and realistic
and i believe
it deserves a sequel .
or at least a remake .
if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game
and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea
and execution of the dragoon system is enough
to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometime cheating
( stupid buster wand )
combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy .
