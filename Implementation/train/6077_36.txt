for the viewer
who comes upon it long after its making ,
`` winchester '73 '' has something in common with `` casablanca . ''
while you watch it ,
you get this feeling
that you are looking at a string of clich\u00e9s encountered so often in the genre ;
then you realise
that the clich\u00e9s became clich\u00e9s only after being copied from this particular film ,
and that they were so widely copied
because this film was so great .
in other word 
it is a seminal work .
`` winchester '73 '' is a joy to watch .
the oad line of the plot are somewhat predictable ,
but mostly because you have seen them copied so many time in later movie ,
and nevertheless it still contains a number of twist
which surprise you .
the dialogue 
the pacing and mann 's direction are excellent .
stewart shine in particular ,
and if
you are a fan this
is a `` must-see 
''
but he is not alone in delivering a good performance .
remarkably 
many of the most thoughtful and/or witty line go to minor character .
because this makes these character
( much )
more than cardboard cutout ,
it lent additional realism to the film .
this is a remarkably underrated film ,
and well worth
keeping an eye out for .
the dvd also contains an interview with stewart
which provides some background on the film .
