a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam .
urmila and manoj bajpai have given
their best.there is a natural flair in the movie
and i felt it right through .
it looked like bollywood finally gave away
it is glamor
and had some quality artist performing on screen.content wise ,
the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition
by showing the suffering of a particular family
and also shows
that trust in one 's life goes beyond religion.the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding
and melodrama.i simply loved it .
