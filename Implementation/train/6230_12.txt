all i can really say
is that i am glad
that i was knitting sock
while watching the movie ,
or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hour of my life .
the acting was terrible ,
the plot was even worse .
there were some scene
that were meant to be serious
that had my husband and i laughing out loud .
i highly recommend this movie to person
who like to do their own version of mst3k .
