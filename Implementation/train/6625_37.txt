deep shock plays out like a tv movie :
a whole cast of commercial-quality actor 
a poorly designed creature
to be the `` bad guy 
''
and a script
that is more full of technical 
political jargon and importance
than it knows what to do with.i checked out the movie
because of the creature
( i love to see what filmmaker have in mind for their design in these cheaply
made video ) ,
and right off the bat 
i got disappointed
because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie .
the actor i expected
because of the type of film
it is
( really quite generic
and not thought out past a certain point ) .
the music was typical 
not-thought-out action symphonic music.i liked the design of the computer and technical equipment 
along with the mini-sub design .
the movie even flowed really well ,
with guiding screen letting you know
which set you are watching the story unfold in .
but there is not much of a story here
anyways.this movie gets a 3/10 star imo .
the boring search and destroy mission
to blow up the north pole
and these creature
protecting it ... kinda lame .
even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the character
that you do not see coming .
chalk this one up to being a movie
which tries to get actor ' career off the bench and into a video .
do not bother .
