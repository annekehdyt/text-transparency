exceptionally horrible tale
that i can barely put into word .
the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victim turns up at the end 
alive and well ,
only to be massacred again .
there is the chance
that i missed some crucial plot element
since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby
was on .
the box
that the movie comes in show scene
that are never even in the film .
i was lured in by the crude image of bondage torture and promise of a 'euro-trash 
sexy horror flick . '
i get the feeling
this was the budget version
and about one quarter of the film was left out .
all the good stuff more than likely .
i got the pg-13 addition
that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'planet of the apes ' movie .
watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff .
you will need it .
