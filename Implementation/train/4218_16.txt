imagine you are a high-school boy 
in the back of a dark 
uncrowded theater with your girlfriend .
how bad would a movie have to be ,
in order
that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home
before it ended ?
this movie is that bad .
really .
movie often become so bad
that they are good ;
this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness .
it is painfully bad .
horribly 
terribly 
crime-against-humanity bad .
