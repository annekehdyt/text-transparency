this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi ;
after watching it on youtube
that is .
set in the distant past after the ice age 
it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil .
nekron 
lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana 
has set their sight on conquest of the known world .
when their glacier destroy 's the village of a man
named larn ,
he
( larn )
vows to avenge his person
and kill the ice lord .
meanwhile 
the sub-human minion of nekron and juliana capture firekeep 's king jarol 's sultry daughter princess teegra ;
but she manages to escape ,
and eventually meet with larn ,
who promises to escort her back to firekeep ;
if the sub-human do not find them first.this movie did very little box office
( as did most of ralph bakshi 's film ) ,
but has become a cult classic 
partly for the quality of the art 
a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta .
also 
i have heard
that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas 
the two man
who had done conan comic book story ,
and the background painter included jame gurney 
the illustrator of the dinotopia novel ;
though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia .
and also the painter thomas kinkade ,
noted for his artwork for figurine 
music-box for the bradford exchange company besides painting .
and like bakshi 's film the lord of the ring and american pop 
this movie was rotoscoped ,
but the process works better in this film than in the former.so overall ,
i think
it is one of the best animated fantasy movie ever made 
and an awesome collaboration between two great mind - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta .
with plenty of fantasy 
sexual innuendo 
and thrilling adventure .
