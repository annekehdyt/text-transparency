i read the book a long time back
and do not specifically remember the plot
but do remember
that i enjoyed it .
since i am home sick on the couch
it seemed like a good idea and hey ! !
it is a lifetime movie.the movie
is populated with grade b actor
and actresses.the female cast is right out of desperate housewife .
i have never seen the show
but there are lot of commercial for the show
and i get the gist .
is there nothing original anymore ?
sure 
but not on lifetime.the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking
and acting but the girl need
to have husband i suppose.in one scene a female
is struggling with a male 
for her life ,
and what does she do ? ? ?
kick him in the testicle .
what else ?
woman love
that
but let me tell you girl something ...
it is not as easy
as it is always made to look.it was not all bad .
i did get the chill a time
or two so i have to credit someone with that .
