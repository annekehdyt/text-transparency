one of the most provocative film ever with excellent cinematography
backed up by mc claren lisp and stunning quote
`` do you believe in love at first site ?
`` .a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture ,
further catapulting the film flawless integrity .
gabby
( aka joey )
played by eva longorium clearly loved the movie and role
she played so much
that she could not even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography .
lol.the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt 
the heroic rescue by mc clure
as he saved the young 'handicapped ' kid with the speech impediment..
which i may add
was acted to perfection !
jame cahiil 's use of sound effect is unmatched even to this day .
the drug bust
he performs early in the film
is pain stakingly realistic .
when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused other from the southside gang and the ctm
( cut throat mafia ) .
this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill
has committed to filming.personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future .
that if i can find it anywhere 
lol !
