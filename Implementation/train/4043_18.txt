for fan of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed
then this film for you !
there is a good amount of blood shed within the confine of this film ,
also the effect can be impressionable and awesome .
the plot is ridiculous and refreshing ,
not being chained down
to what
we as audience are expectant of from film
these days.also notable are the little alien ,
who i found cute .
all in all ,
it is a good film for fan of the genre .
also recommended are film such as tetsuo :
the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach 
filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed .
of course ,
seeing this film
you should already have knowledge of the two .
