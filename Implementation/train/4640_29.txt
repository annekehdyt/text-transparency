a spoiler.what three word can guarantee you a terrible film ?
cheap canadian production .
the brain fit those word perfectly .
terrible script 
idiotic acting and hilarious special effect make this a must for every bad movie fan .
the horror is hilarious .
the post production team looks like it gave up .
what makes the brain admirable is in the second half ,
it actually try to be good !
can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke ?
it is around christmas time .
a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest
looking villain ever .
the day later 
a rebel teen gets into enough trouble
that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.if a cop 's head
is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you
some kid did it ,
who would you believe ?
what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end
when the brain try to be serious .
a child can not be frightened by the scary moment .
the brain is too funny a concept
to try
and be gritty .
the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plant !
our ugly villain and its cohort get credit
for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen .
viewer discretion advised heavily .
