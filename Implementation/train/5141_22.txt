yesterday i saw the movie flyboys and my girlfriend told me
it was the worst movie
she is ever seen ...
since i thought
it was pretty awful as well
it got me thinking -
which film was the worst film i
had ever seen
and this was the only film
that came to mind.unfortunately
it was a couple of year
since i have seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man
( pretty boy cain does not do cocky very well ) .
the strange deal with the cgi-helicopter
when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some cgi-guy
to make it ,
but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some cgi program or the producer 's son liked to play with his new computer .
and how did it look ? ?
awful .
and when the dragon charge through the corridor of the complex then reuse the same shot over
and over - looks very cheap.avoid this movie -
it is truly awful ...
