`` the crush '' is a pleasant enough 40-something friend romantic chick flick for the first two-third or so ,
as it tries to be a brit `` sex and the city '' .
i particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk
whose character is not much fleshed out
( come to think
of it we did not see all
that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of ) .
they sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman
than was made of the opposite in either version of `` saina ''
( neither movie do i like )
or for that matter with the douglas/zeta-jone or dion/svengali nuptials.surrounding andie macdowell
as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiar from brit dramas and comedy 
such as tart-tongued anna chancellor .
the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina .
but it was not until the credit came up at the end
that i realized what might really be wrong .
just as with `` sex and the city 
''
the writer/director is male 
here first-timer scot john mckay ,
and i think
he really wanted to do a script about three gay man ,
probably about them coming out in relation to their lover and at work
( the character are a school principal 
a cop and a doctor ) ,
which would have been a better and more interesting movie .
the working title for the film was `` the sad f*cker 's club ''
which would have made its parallel with the gay `` broken heart club '' even more obvious .
