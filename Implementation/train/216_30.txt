if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet ,
then the lion king 3 :
hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern
and rosencrantz are dead .
just like tom stoppard 's beguiling film ,
we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor character from the original : timon 
the meerkat with a penchant for eaking into song at the drop of a hat 
and pumbaa 
the warthog with flatulence issue .
by following their story - rather than simba 's -
we get to see
why all the animal bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock .
we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar .
and we find out
how they dealt with the hyena 's once and for all .
nathan lane as timon gets most of the best joke ,
but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa .
it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their role .
julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voice to two new character :
timon 's mother and uncle .
the only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device
which does not always help to progress the story .
having said
that 
there is a illiant zoom near the beginning of the movie .
with more laugh than any other third-in-a-disney-series movie 
hakuna matata is worth watching -
if only for the hot tub scene
which is still funny
despite being a little bit predictable .
