this western is done in a different manner than most other .
realism is the key here .
conchatum farrell comes to wyoming
to work for rip
torn on his ranch .
how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana .
i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape ,
but it is worth a look
to see just how life was back in the real west .
cinematography is excellent .
solid 9. torn and farrell excel in this movie .
