... and in *no way* as clean 
logical 
and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches.i am 27 
and i have spent 16 year of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucination .
like the main character in the film 
i was successful mainly because of logic :
because i kept thinking over
and over
to keep delusion away from reality ,
and to know
what was really going on
and what was not .
in the end 
i was really successful
because of medication 
by the way ,
but i certainly escaped madness
because i knew
before i took medication the difference
between what was real
and what was not.so ,
i feel entitled to tell you
that this movie is a total fraud .
not only does it cheat with the main character 's story
( who was not faithful to his wife ,
who was bisexual -
something really important here ) ,
but mostly 
it shows a comforting 
tamed view of schizophrenia -
which is entirely missing the point.schizophrenia
is a mind structure 
not a disease .
a schizophrenic *is not* a `` normal man with a disease '' ,
it is someone who from early on view
and feel thing differently from most person :
for him 
thing like time 
space 
and person 's personality are not solid thing .
he feel
it can be bent ,
it can change ,
it can mutate ,
and maybe even disappear .
to cope with this 
a schizophrenic has a rich 
very imaginative inner world
which `` normal '' person
do not expect -
but he is trapped in it
because he can not relate with most person ,
and his world gets poorer and poorer
until he finishes in a blank ,
delusive dead end.this is very different to what is depicted in this ridiculous `` cure '' 
tear-jerking movie .
it should be violently frightening .
person other than the main character should appear strange 
weird and absurd 
like in lynch 's `` eraserhead '' 
for example .
there should be *really* impressive 
weird 
gross hallucination ,
because that is what schizophrenia is all about .
it is not about *detail*.i mean 
watch `` naked lunch '' 
`` lost highway '' 
read p.k .
dick 's `` martian time-split '' or `` ubik '' 
do watch `` the cell '' 
`` perfect blue '' 
`` dark city '' 
or play `` american mcgee 's alice '' on pc ,
and you may have a vague idea
of what it is like .
do not watch the `` feel good '' movie of the month 
with banal situation 
cleaned character and visual 
and stupid plot trick .
`` the cell '' is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic 's mind 
his vision and his inner consistency -
it is violent 
weird 
confusing 
and very 
very scary.once again ,
schizophrenia is not about detail ,
it is not a neat ,
tame trick played to you .
it jumps in your face
and will not let you go :
wall fall apart 
person turn into strange hostile creature ,
you feel like you go backward in time ,
you are not sure you are who you think
you are ,
everything feel ... strange 
unnatural .
believe me ,
this is much much more
than what is depicted in this soap-like melodrama
