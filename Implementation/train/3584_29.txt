ok - i admit .
i think
kenny doughty look amazing in this movie -
but beyond his good look ,
the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable ,
but reasonable plot.starting out ,
we are introduced to the three lead female of the movie .
one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married .
a police officer - with child and a bad ex
to go on about .
the third - a power and status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's.they are almost the `` first wives club '' ,
and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex 's involved as well
as some `` he left the credit card '' behaviour .
character set - the movie continues.mcdowell 's character 
the headmistress 
arrives late at a funeral -
where a young organist ,
filling in for the regular player
( doughty )
catches her eye .
what will her two friend say about the ensuing mischief ?
will they live happily ever after ?
a tissue or two recommended
if you are the teary type
- the end uplifting ,
but maybe not what you would expect .
all in all a great movie
which stands out amongst the current choice of action 
special effect and schlock horror .
