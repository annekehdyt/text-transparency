what an awful movie .
i love monster flick
but i could not watch even half of the terrible acting 
cardboard character and abysmal special effect .
there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
the character come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else
they are vacuous 
uninspiring sock puppet .
the plot is formulaic 
cut and paste 
standard science-run-amok drivel .
even the cgi is horrible .
you know
it is bad
when you can not even depend on the movie
to provide some good eye candy .
no surprise here ,
just same old same old .
this is truly one of the worst film ever made .
director roger corman should be hung from a lightpost so
that child can use him as a pinata .
