one of the greatest film i have seen this year.last maybe before sun rise ,
which is also seen late at night alone in the lab .
i like the idea of the film ,
which suggest
free will of man and our weakness against fate.with time past by jame and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes .
i do like the end .
but a big question also comes .
the virus shall not be released again ,
should it ? in the last scene in the airport .
jose is sent back to meet jame again by future scientist .
when he tell him
that scientist had already got his message
and know
someone else would spread the virus .
and they two together meet kathryn
when kathryn tell jame the true man is dr. goine assistant .
so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus ,
( jame keep an eye on him at the time remember ? )
and he has teeth .
so why everything is still happen ? ?
why future scientist do not do anything after the truth is revealed ? ?
my biggest question after the film ...
