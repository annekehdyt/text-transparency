i liked this movie i remember
there was one very well done scene in this movie
where riff randell
( played by p.j .
sole ) is lying in her bed smoking pot
and then she begins to visualize
that the ramone are in the room with her sing
the song `` i want you around '' ...
very very cool stuff.it was fun 
energetic 
quirky and cool .
yes i will admit
that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched ...
but it does not matter
because it is fun this
is a very fun movie .
it is sex 
pot and rock n rocll foreveri read
that cheap trick was the band
who was originally to star in this ..but i
do not know
if this is true or not
