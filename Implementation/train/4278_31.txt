`` a trio of treasure hunter is searching the west indie for a hidden fortune .
the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension
as the man come closer to the treasure 's location .
the deep-sea diver hope to track down the gold ,
but find that greed and hatred lead to murder 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis .
`` manfish '' is the name of their boat 
not a monster .
the skeleton
who gives muscular captain john bromfield
( as brannigan )
his half of the treasure map is very good .
old salt victor jory
( as professor )
provides the other half of the map .
first mate lon chaney jr.
( as swede )
plays dumb ,
and sexy tessa prendergast
( as alita )
guards the rum
( not very well 
obviously ) .
serious editing and continuity problem mar the picture ,
which otherwise might have amounted to something .
*** manfish
