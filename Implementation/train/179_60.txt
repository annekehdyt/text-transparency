you will notice by the star i
have given this great film
that ' ...
before you see it the first time 
'
is implied .
i had never
before heard of this film
and happened across it just because this week
( and last ) was a very slow rental experience
( not much great coming in ) .
i am not sure
how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too .
still 
it did.this movie is an awesome example of what to do
if you do not have a large budget .
it had just the right amount of plot and dialog
to make it very interesting
and keep the viewer in the dark ;
just enough .
the entire film is you
( the viewer )
trying to figure out the plot many twist and turn .
i would have given this film 10/10 ,
however some of the shot were pretty fake looking .
i do not hold that against this film too much ,
but i do not think
it deserves a perfect score.lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious
( as always ) .
i think
she is pretty underrated as a serious talent .
nevermind her beauty
( which is difficult ) ,
she really takes her roles seriously
and does not rest on her appearance to drive her through scene of sophisticated emotion .
and she can seem cold and even lifeless
if needed ,
as well.jeremy northam does really well ,
at first 
as quite a geeky corporate rat ,
willing to run through any maze
to prove himself .
however ,
as he changes throughout the film ,
it is like night and day .
i know
some fan of clive owen 
jude law 
or other hopefuls
to become the next james bond
will hate me for this ,
but northam would/could/should fit that bill .
he is suave and cultured .
he is got a great bond posture and voice .
i think
he too can be cold
if the situation calls for it 
and rather down-to-earth 
as well.great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once
if you like corporate espionage film .
