the acting 
other review notwithstanding 
was remarkably well-done .
brad pitt handles the role of an annoying 
obnoxious austrian climber quite well .
other acting is fine .
the story could have been riveting 
but somehow ,
it misses -
one never really understands or care for the character shown ,
and so the story ,
which could have been quite dramatic ,
fails to draw in this audience.beautiful scenery and cinematography 
a remarkably dramatic true story 
important event
that shaped the world
that we live in -
but i could not ,
try as i might ,
involve myself in this story .
as an unabashed brad pitt fan
( i consider him one of the top 5 actor of his generation ) ,
i expected to *love* this flick - and yet ,
it left me cold.it could be a failing within myself ,
but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction 
scriptwriting 
production 
editing - somehow 
they lost me .
it is a shame ,
because it could have been wonderful.good acting 
dramatic story 
beautifully shot -
it should have been magnificent .
it was not .
probably worth watching ,
just to make your own mind up on it -
but do not expect too much ,
and perhaps you will not be as disappointed
as i was .
mostly 
it bored me .
