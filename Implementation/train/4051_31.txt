camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii
as it has sound mostly in the right place and a rudimentary plot .
this time they have ventured slightly further away from the car park
the other two movie were filmed
in which is a good move
as you can no longer hear car
driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness.this time around there
is a reality tv show and a fake clown
to scare off the contestant .
this is hardly a new idea ,
i have seen at least three other horror movie with exactly the same premise
where the real killer turns up
but at least this one has a plot instead of person
just randomly being stabbed with a knife.unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laugh .
i liked how there is a gunshot sound effect
when someone gets stabbed early on and the way
the boom mike hover behind person like a phantom.i do not know
why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film ,
i would have thought
it would be better to start from scratch
but they have at least tried with this one .
the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me ,
it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak
who would get her clothe off for $ 5 just like
they did in the second movie .
they still have not worked out
that a machete is used
for cutting not stabbing but oh well ,
it is a camp blood movie
what do you expect ?
if you like crap film you will get some fun out of this one .
