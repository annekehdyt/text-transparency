first off to get my own personal feeling out of the way let me start
by saying
that i hate so called comedy
where every single character is written and played as being so stupid
that you wounder
if they are all the result of ineeding.now i will say
this i did see the first three american pie movie
and while they were not the most amazing movie
that i would ever seen
they were all right
( and outright masterpiece compared to the three `` american pie present '' film ) ,
i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking
when they made this movie ?
i also have a few other question too.who
thought
that this was an acceptable use of studio fund and production resource ?
who approved the final script
( and what was that person smoking
when they approved it ) ?
and lastly why did anyone think
that it deserved to be released into theater
where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollar depending
on where you live
when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or wal mart ?
there is so much wrong with this movie that i can not write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed word on this forum so i will just touch on the biggest thing wrong with it.the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and character are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minute but the biggest thing
that i can see wrong with this movie
is the acting.while most of the cast are talentless no namer
who will probably be forgotten in a few year 
the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy
who spends almost all of the time
he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face
that says to the viewer `` i know
this is not funny and i am wasting my talent
but hey i am getting payed for it so who cares ''
he does not even try to make any of his joke funny
( he really deserves better than this garbage ) .
as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible
even though some of them have been in some really great tv show 
tyrone savage
( from the classic canadian series wind at my back )
plays a character
who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating
( there are thing
that he could teach to tropical skin disease )
that you almost wish
he had die a slow and painful death on screen 
christopher mcdonald
( ncis 
law and order )
just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line
so they can get around the mpaa
and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content
that it should have gotten the x rating
( the rating board must have been drunk or on drug
when they reviewed this film for its rating ) .
it is interesting that twenty five year ago when wes craven submitted a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review
they forced him to cut twenty five second of footage
( i believe
that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a east in it ) to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would not have been released 
but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because it is all done in the name of comedy 
if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded x rating.the last thing that really annoys me is the writing 
this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass 
nearly every expository situation
that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed
that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so
called character are just stereotype of stereotype of stereotype ,
never mind the often repulsive sexual reference
and constant unnecessary scene of deviant sexual behavior
it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.the long
and short of it is its time
to kill this series
before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive ,
this pie is filled with road apple .
