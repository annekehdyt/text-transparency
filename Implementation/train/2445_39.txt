for those
who like their murder mystery busy ,
this is definitely the one to see ,
as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious character 
most of them wealthy long island socialite type .
as the star detective 
william powell is alternately starchy and inspired 
behaving at time
as if he and his suit went to the cleaner
and got pressed together .
mary astor is very lovely here .
powell had made a career out
of playing the lead character 
philo vance ,
in a series of movie made at a couple of studio over several year .
in-between these film
he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead ,
at time even essaying gentleman gangster role .
already middle-aged 
he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along .
as with so many early talkie star 
it seemed that his time had come and gone ,
that he was fine for early depression prohibition-era film ,
but that with changing time he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to endure.the kennel murder case ,
directed by the criminally neglected michael curtiz ,
is one of the last of the `` old powell '' ,
while the next year would herald in the first of the new one 
the thin man 
the success of which would catapult its leading player into the hollywood stratosphere .
in kennel we can see the movie still in a somewhat stiff 
ritualized pattern ,
as the camera does not move much 
with the acting 
like the presentation 
tending toward the theatrical .
there is no harm in this approach 
though ,
which has its charm .
it gives the movie a baroque quality .
