on first watching this film
it is hard to know quite what has happened ,
but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear .
i enjoyed this movie .
dean cain was excellent in the role of bob .
lexa doig 's character was confusing to understand 
at first 
she was out to trap bob
but i really believe
she landed up loving him
although by then she had oken his heart .
dean cain 's performance was an usual excellent .
he gets better with every film
he does .
my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob 
camilla and the baby .
it was left for the viewer
to decide
