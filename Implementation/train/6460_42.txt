i did not really know
what this movie was about
when i went to the theater
to see it
( hype about the satanism etc etc etc )
as the trailer in the last movie i saw looked pretty interesting.oh dear 
roman catholic mythology ?
not my idea of a good scare and honestly 
i just felt like watching a really good 
scary movie 
not some loosely plotted religious farce
that tries to score cheap thrill
by having some chick getting bloody every few minute !
i
will try to keep away from the spoiler
( ! )
but i found it very odd
that an atheist ,
who gets a string of rosary bead from a deceased priest ,
could suddenly end up with christ 's wound
( are not stigmata supposed to be deeply religious ? ? )
i mean ,
she hangs out with loser ,
does loser stuff ,
behave like a typical rebel et al ,
and here she is displaying the wound of jesus christ ? ?
come on ! scene of her crucified 
head thrown back ,
screaming 
blood everywhere 
became rather tedious
after seeing it a dozen time .
it was neither frightening or scary 
just repulsive .
it did 
however ,
become quite painful to watch -
those flicking scene were highly annoying ... conclusion :
if your a catholic 
defintly do not see this .
if you are not ,
still do not see it .
