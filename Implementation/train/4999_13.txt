this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon
as you put any real evidence
on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart siel claims
they must
have had multiple lighting source
because the shadow appear to be crossing
if this were the case
would not there be two or more shadow for each object
when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts
they spent 30 min 's there not the 90 min 's claimed in the documentary
and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray.seriously do some research learn
what really happened do not let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion
of what really happened
