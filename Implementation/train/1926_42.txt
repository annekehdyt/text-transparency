this is the film in antonioni 's middle period
that most critic dismiss quickly ,
as a 'flawed ' look at 60 american youth culture/politic .
for what it is worth ,
i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed film like l'avventura ,
perhaps because he shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else .
the story is simple ,
but it is used as a frame for antonioni 's illiant observation of 
and critique on american consumerist culture 
student life 
the counter-culture 
and the whole anti-establishment 
anti-war backlash
that was so prominent then .
even from a purely technical point of view 
it is a remarkably crafted film ;
from the opening credit sequence to the bizarre desert 'love-in ' 
to the use of billboard 
and right down to that jaw-dropping 
cathartic finale
that used 17 camera set-ups
( in it is own way ,
as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch ) .
also 
antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin 
one of the most beautiful ever
to grace the screen .
there is not much 'acting ' involved ,
as this feels more like a docu-drama ,
and so the use of non- professional as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context .
and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music ,
its use is impressive as well
( i can not forget the start of the film ,
mostly due to the selection of music
- by pink floyd -
that grooms the visual so well )
.contrary to popular opinion 
this is quite an achievement in cinema ,
and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off- beat .
well worth seeking out ,
and one of those key film of the 60
that demands a dvd restoration/release .
