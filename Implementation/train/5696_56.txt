beyond the fact crazy person exist
and there are religious nut out there.the character
basically make no sense most of the time.the film has no real beginning 
middle or ending ,
nor is anything ever explained much.the film opens with a young man 
with the unlikely name of hazel mote ,
apparently returning from a stint in the army.he hitches a ride to a two story house
that is in extreme disrepair ,
window boarded over .
he goes in the house ,
walks around
and finally writes a note
that he leaves there .
this scene comes to nothing ,
and we learn nothing further about the house or its history.it is never explained
exactly whose house this is ,
or where the person have gone ,
but we are given
the impression hazel has probably lived there at one time.hazel decides
to go to a city .
why - we do not know .
once he arrives in this city he writes down a name and address
that he sees on a bathroom wall ,
and goes to visit this woman ,
who is a surprisingly fat hooker .
he sees her for awhile and then he apparently is not seeing her anymore .
like everything else in this movie ,
it comes to nothing and serves no purpose.a young man
named enoch ,
try to befriend him ,
but hazel really is not interested ,
although they keep crossing paths.enoch is about as crazy
as you can get .
one of his habit is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage
where the chimp are and talk at them insultingly.we never really know
why enoch behave as he does ,
or why hazel behave
as he does ,
beyond the fact hazel had an overdose of old time scary ,
fundamentalist religion via his grandfather.enoch later becomes enthralled with a man
who dresses in a gorilla suit ,
and manages to get the gorilla suit from him
and then runs around in it.hazel ,
who is wound rather tight
and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching .
i got the impression
he was trying to free himself from the untruth of the religion
that had been drilled into him.he
has several encounter with a preacher and his daughter ,
although their interaction never really make any particular point ,
and there is no plot line.eventually hazel succumb
to complete religious fervor
and begins self-harming.it is a very odd film .
interesting in it is oddness but other
than that it has absolutely nothing going for it.the cast does an outstanding job ,
but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline.the film also has the character tossing around the n word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog.2 star
