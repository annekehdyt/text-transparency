doppelganger has its moment ,
but they are few and far between.essentially ,
this is a grade b blend of pop-psych thriller 
ghost story and horror .
drew barrymore plays a young woman
who is haunted by the demon of her past
( most of her family has been murdered
and she was 
in at least one case 
the prime suspect ) ,
or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder ?
george newbern is her new room mate ,
and most of the action center on him.newbern 's character is pretty sympathetic ,
and both he and barrymore do decent work
( though not exactly good ) .
the mediocre to
( at time )
totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performance into oblivion .
leslie hope 's character is memorable 
but so irritating
that you will want to forget her.the plot
eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated
( one story arc
is psychological realism ,
the other is supernatural horror )
outlandish climax
which is so badly conceived ,
acted and photographed
that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film
had achieved previously.overall ,
the film has the feel
of what might expect to be the result of m. knight shamalyan 's first undergraduate film class .
the acting and script for the two lead are just good enough
to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely.my recommendation - send your doppelganger ,
but avoid a first-person encounter .
