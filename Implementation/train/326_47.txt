15 year ago 
power ranger was one of the show
that swept the nation 
especially that of the youth .
when i was a 3-year-old kid living in the philippine ,
i would watch this show every friday on abs-cbn
( channel 2 over there ) .
when the movie came out in 1995 ,
it was all shock and awe to me
when i watched it with my dad and 2 uncle .
my grandparent even sent me a `` balikbayan '' box full of power ranger stuff
( including the easy-to-build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the ranger ) .
i even played the video game ,
and loved only one of them
( `` mmpr :
fighting edition '' ) ,
which was really sad .
anyway 
it was the show
that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series
( especially anime mech series like `` gundam '' )
now that i am 18 
i would like to think
this show is pretty cheesy to me now .
to prove this ,
i took a trip down memory lane
by buying a 2-set dvd collection with `` mmpr :
the movie '' and `` turbo :
a power ranger movie ''
and watched both of them .
i was like 
`` ugh .
how awful .
just another junk in the attic for me . ''
for all of you person of my generation 
this is not a show
that you would want to watch over and over again .
i am not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life ,
but occasionally is not a bad thing now ,
is it ?
instead of `` power ranger '' 
i would recommend something like `` mobile fighter g gundam ''
( highly recommended ) ,
`` ninja senshi tobikage ''
( aka ninja robot ) ,
or even the original sentai show
that were the basis of `` power ranger . ''
