a single mother
( diane keaton )
finds herself working several minimum-wage job .
when she gets fired ,
she finds
that she is unable to support her son
( michael seater and colin robert ) ,
the latter of whom has asthma .
then she goes to her friend and starts selling drug .
soon enough 
she gets addicted to the drug
that she is selling .
her life comes crashing down ,
especially when her kid 
namely her oldest son 
find out the truth and threaten to leave her .
then 
she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kid
but can she protect her family from the drug lord
who she worked for ?
wow !
this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i
have ever seen !
diane keaton overacts a lot 
and her character comes off as crazy
but she was extremely convincing .
she is much better suited to drama than to comedy .
however 
the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater ,
who plays her oldest son .
he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young
but trying to be the adult in the family .
his acting was especially great in the scene
where he confronts his mom about the drug .
colin robert ,
who plays the younger son ,
also does a great job.a movie well worth watching ,
especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton !
