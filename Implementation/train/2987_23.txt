what a poor image of professional police officer is displayed on the television in the watching of this alleged reality show .
one can only hope
that the actual reasonable suspicion
that leads to probable cause
that leads to the totality of the circumstance involved
to make a `` stop '' ,
then the `` pat down '' of the outside of one 's garment ,
then to be able to articulate
why the officer went into someone 's pocket and retrieved contraband ,
was cut out of the scene ,
because
if it was not ,
the arrest in most place are going to be tossed ,
should they even get passed a supervisor .
a report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant
unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand .
if the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout ,
it is good enough for an arrest ,
but it does not necessarily mean
the warrant is still in effect .
since i have not seen a dis-claimer from cbs
( i may have missed it ) ,
cbs could be in trouble .
