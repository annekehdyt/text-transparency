while a pleasant enough musical ,
what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone 
as the has-been composer 
and oscar levant as his assistant .
playing a high strung 
distracted artistic type
( a far cry from his more familiar role as either menacing villain or the coolly logical sherlock holme ) ,
rathbone 's character looks like he could not find his way out of bed
without help .
and that help is starbuck ,
played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant .
upon hiring crosby 's character as his ghost song writer 
rathbone introduce him to starbuck by saying ,
`` he does all my thinking for me .
`` ,
to
which levant respond 
`` ah ,
it is only a part-time job . ''
of course this goes right past
( or over ) rathbone ,
who 's too busy fretting
about where his next hit song will come from .
as another reviewer said ,
who knew rathbone
could be so funny !
too bad he did not have more opportunity to display his comedic talent .
