if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie ,
then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hour you will never get back .
i can not believe
that no one has commented
that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re .
first 
a `` special '' commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix
that has an ai and holographic projection .
and this `` hive '' rip-off has a series of trap
that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time .
there is even a chess reference in the code name ,
which was in the dialog of re .
despite the fact
that there are no zombie ,
the `` rook '' 
the movie 's nemesis 
is some sort of bio-creature 
very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue ,
with a lot of cyborg component just like a super mutant of re .
so 
a wag-of-the-finger to mr. richard taylor
for claiming any credit for this story.they are not the same movie obviously ,
but the writer got the idea
watching resident evil i think .
