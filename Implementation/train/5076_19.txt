i had never heard of robert roy macgregor
before `` rob roy '' came out ,
but the movie is definitely worth seeing .
playing the title character ,
liam neeson ings the same spirit to the role
that he ought to oskar schindler ,
and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary .
archibald cunningham
( tim roth )
is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.all in all ,
this comes out as good as `` braveheart ''
( maybe even better ) .
i laugh
when i think
of how hollywood released two movie almost back-to-back taking a swipe at england .
very good .
also starring john hurt 
eric stoltz 
brian cox and jason flemyng .
