actually one particular person/character is not `` right there '' ,
but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie .
and this is all achieved
without any fancy camera move and/or big production set 
but with a great story and very ( believable )
and good actor conveying the story
( arc )
.you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies/cinema
( such as tokyo story etc .
) 
not so much story-wise of course ,
but more mood-wise !
great acting 
nuance in the performance
that are truly gem .
if you are eager to experience a touching story
and want to see a movie touching you emotionally ,
than this is the one to go .
as you have noticed
( as with many of my review ) ,
i am not getting into the story .
there are place here at imdb
where you can look those up ,
i am not one to spoiler the story whatsoever !
