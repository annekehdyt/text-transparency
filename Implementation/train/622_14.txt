the egyptian movie has a lot of filme with high level of drama or romance or comedy or action even sport ... `` ziab la ta'kohl al lam '' was banned in egypt
because it content nudity
( full frontal female nudity )
and this kind of nudity is prohibited in the egyptian movie..
when i saw this movie i felt down ... fool story.. nude actress.. bad action.. some horror and awful colors.. dear friend..
if you wan na see a great egyptian movie ...
simply :
stay away form `` ziab la ta'kohl al lam '' ..
we have great movie in egypt ...
we have a great actor
who won a global win like :
omar el sheriff or gameel rateb.. we have great director like `` yousef shahin ''
so believe
me pall.. you do not need to see this movie..
