okay 
there are a ton of review here ,
what can i possibly add ? i will try anyway .
the reason
this is my favorite scrooge
is because of everything .
the set 
outdoor location 
costume are so beautiful and authentic .
the music is sweet .
the supporting cast is very well done .
one of my favorite is the narrator and nephew ,
played by roger ree .
his understated sincerity is touching
and his voice is the sound of christmas to me .
david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit .
his is a difficult life ,
but he remains positive and dignified .
the best part of course- is george c. scott as ebenezer scrooge .
some have said his portrayal too gruff .
i could not disagree more .
his exchange at the beginning
while cold or harsh ,
were not out of character .
he is a terribly disillusioned man
who 's heart has been hardened by the vicissitude of life and his own lust for wealth .
during the flashback 
it is obvious
that he is not all gruff .
this is where we see
that there is hope for him .
if he was totally gone ,
his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place .
and after all 
we are none of us past hoping .
i think
that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say .
when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer 's with belle ,
you see him smile regretfully
as he tells belle in the flashback
that he will go through life `` with a grin on my face . ''
clive donner was smart enough as the director
to allow these moment on film .
sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.and finally ,
his conversion is so absolutely full of joy
that it makes me cry tear of joy every time i see it .
his apology to his nephew fred 
so sincere ,
so moving ,
it is the spirit not only of christmas ,
but of humanity itself .
the joy he ings to fred ,
to his wife are so apparent .
and the line
that gets me every time ,
`` god forgive me for the time i have wasted . ''
bravi tutti !
