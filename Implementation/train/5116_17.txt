i know
it is crude ,
and i know
that it is not at all pc ,
but it is so funny .
if you can put it into perspective
that it is from the early 80 's
and it carries all the stereotype of the time
-- and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter --
than it is truly a good comedy .
going with the tradition of what comedy have been for thousand of year ,
the subject matter of this film is exagerated .
if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half ,
just to have an all-out laugh 
than please watch this.p.s .
would someone please put this out on dvd ,
it is so hard to find on vhs anymore .
