if the theme of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should .
that is because anita loos
who wrote the screenplay here
also wrote the classic gentleman prefer blonde .
unlike marilyn monroe in that film 
jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from man of mean.and
it is man of mean that jean harlow is after .
she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather
because she is decided that the best way
to gain the easy life
is to marry it .
her talent as a chorus girl are limited ,
but she will be able to trade in on that beauty.her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation
to perform at a party
thrown by millionaire lewis stone .
but unbeknownst to jean 
stone 's just having a wild last fling
before doing himself
because of the money
he owes not owns .
still she wrangles a few bauble from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notice .
lionel 's amused by it until jean set her sight on his playboy son 
franchot tone .
after that he is not amused
and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree.the girl from missouri
went into production mid adaption of the code
so it went under peculiar censorship .
i have a feeling
we would have seen a much more risqu\u00e9 film .
still jean harlow
as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated .
what a great comic talent
that woman had ,
seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss
the world of film
sustained with her passing three year later.ironically enough
the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful short kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde 
thelma todd .
harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry
between that patsy had with thelma .
todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide
that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given .
do not miss the girl from missouri ,
it is ight and sassy ,
must be from all that sparkling jewelry .
