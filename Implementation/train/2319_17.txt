the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i have seen in my life .
the plot is slow and lacking .
the acting is borderline comical .
while i love paul muni ,
i can now say
i have seen a film
that does not do his true ability justice .
the only saving grace i
found with this film
is it is production value .
the use of hundred of extra throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment .
also 
the beautiful effect
used to create the illusion of million of wasps sells easily
and was revolutionary at the time .
other than the production value i can say little else
that is good or entertaining about this film .
