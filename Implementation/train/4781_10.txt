`` the domino principle '' is ,
without question ,
one of the worst thriller ever made .
hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point
you will want to throw your arm up in frustration
and scream `` i give up ! ! !
`` how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got
involved in this mess
must only be summed up by their paychecks.i hope
they spent their money well .
