very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detective trying to solve the murder of a woman
whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park ,
and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm .
although released by rko ,
this has the look of an independent production
that was picked up by the studio for distribution .
the cast and crew 
with a few exception
-- among them a young and uncredited jack lord 
director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner --
are comprised of complete unknown ,
and it shows .
the performance are universally sub-par
and would not pass muster in a high school training film ,
the direction is stodgy and choppy and ,
as mentioned previously ,
there is no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actor .
however ,
despite the film 's many shortcoming ,
it does have a few good point .
the location shooting in new york city ,
and the film 's ultra-low budget 
gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior `` the naked city '' ,
a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled ,
and some of the investigating procedure are clever .
otherwise 
it is not much to write home about .
it is worth a look 
however 
for a glimpse at the seamier section of new york city in the early 1950s 
and old-car buff will be ecstatic to see the legion of '30 and '40s car in the streets..
