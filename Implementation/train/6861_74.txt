esther kahn is a young jewish woman
living in an overcrowded ,
jewish ghetto in 19th century england .
she is surrounded by looming 
oppressive 
dreary 
featureless ,
worn ick architecture 
narrow sidewalk and street 
blacked out window ,
and horde of black-and-own jacketed crowds.she lives in a tiny apartment with her large family
whom operate a clothe shop within the apartment .
as child ,
she worked ,
had no privacy ,
wore colourless clothing ,
shared a bed ,
and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and sibling
who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom.as a young woman ,
her life remains the same -
she has no privacy ,
lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia 
exudes a blank 
featureless expression ,
is clothed in plain 
unremarkable clothing ,
and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey 
mundane 
massively imposing building 
and narrow street 
and narrow hallway 
and narrow doorway 
and her loud-mouthed mother and sibling 
and the prosaic 
banal lifestyle of her family.her only form of mental escape is the yiddish theatre .
sitting in the balcony 
front row ,
leaning over the rail ,
there is a vast space between her mind and the stage 
a space
that enables her to eathe 
think 
feel 
and yearn.yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for esther 
her face and body remain torpidly somnolent 
impassive 
dispassionate.the plain and common looking summer phoenix illiantly conveys esther 's emotionless demeanour - summer/esther does not convey any desire
to want anything or anticipate anything.after an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother 
esther finally decides to eak free from the bleak life she is trapped in.she is eventually cast in minor part in a few stage play 
and meet nathan quellen 
portrayed by quintessential british actor ian holm 
who commences to teach esther the technical skill of acting.from this point forward 
esther begin a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel.she begin experiencing emotion she never felt before 
and she begin gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspect of acting.nathan walk her across the stage through the physical and emotional step of surprise 
hesitancy 
anger 
disgust 
self-loathing 
etc ; she then begin walking through those emotion in her personal life.there are three truth 
nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts 
the truth of how the actor would react 
and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person.these technical step and three truth slowly deconstruct esther 's defense and lead her to two edifying experience in the denouement of the film
which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought 
movement ,
and emotion.esther kahn is a technically challenging film
to watch
because of its odd and narrow camera shot 
lackluster photo direction
which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the ghetto 
and summer phoenix 's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal
which illiantly conveys kahn 's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature.a must-see film for person
who want to learn the technical craft of acting 
and for person
who appreciate minimalistic film and character study .
