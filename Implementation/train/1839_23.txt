this film has a clear storyline ,
which is quite unusual to the musical genre .
`` cat '' 
`` phantom of the opera '' 
and other andrew lloyd webber 's musical can be considered metaphorical ,
as they use literary work as their framework .
`` biarkan bintang menari ''
( bbm )
's storyline touches the very core of human relationship 
especially that of indonesian person .
despite the fact
the film was based on a `` supposedly '' fairytale ,
it is actually a fantasy of the 'child ' in indonesian adult .
the dance sequence are not perfect ,
yet the song represent how indonesian express themselves .
i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing ,
by not dismaying the fact
that indonesia 's dance development tends to be more westernized .
the dance sequence seem awkward in some way and not synchronized with the song and/or music .
yet 
i still love this movie
and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre
which i hope to improve in the future .
