i must admit
that at the beginning 
i was sort of reticent
about watching this movie .
i thought
it was this stupid 
little 
romantic film about a french woman
who meets in the train an american
and decide to visit vienna with him .
i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script ,
since it continued to make me believe
that it is just a movie .
still 
i watched it !
and i was amazed ... ''
before sunrise '' is one of the few film
who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way ,
wondering about the fact
that in the moment of our birth 
we are sentenced to death ,
or that it is a middling idea
that fact
that a couple should rest together for eternity ,
or that 
we 
human 
can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tale .
the ending was wonderfully chosen
( we do not know
if they will meet again in six month ,
at six o'clock 
in vienna 's station )
-in our optimism 
we sincerely hope so .
the actor acted in a very good manner 
so ,
that 
i began to believe
that i 
myself could live a love-story just like this .
