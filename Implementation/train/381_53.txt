can scarcely imagine a better movie than thishey ,
before you all go `` chick flick '' on me .
i am a very large strong and masculine 
macho man ,
who happens to think
this was one of the better movie of the last 20 year .
the acting was superb
and the story was marvelous .
this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul .
the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast .
i have known for a good
while that mercedes ruehl 
along with holly hunter 
joan plowright 
dame edith evan 
sissy spacek 
judi dench is among the greatest actress ever to appear on film .
and of course cloris leachman
( also in this film )
in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied role
she has appeared in over the year.. at any rate
this
was an amazing cast .
this film was like a book
that you can not lay down ,
and
when you have reached the last page wish for more ... still more .
i can not for the life of me understand
why this film here on the imdb only rate a 3.9that rating here is utterly amazing to me .
or perhaps not .
perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well
and that is what makes me really sad .
it makes me ever so sad
that film like `` american beauty '' `` leaving las vegas '' `` sexy beast ''
and `` fight club '' rating skyrocket off the chart in popularity
when they in fact at least in this viewer opinion should have received an `` r '' rating ... r
that is for `` rubbish '' .
hey o.k. 
i realize
there are a lot of different story in this world for a lot of different audience ,
but it is a sad commentary when this lovely 
powerful ... extraordinarily 
directed 
acted ,
and written film seems to be over looked .
it obviously was at the academy award as well ... .how sad .
and how predictable .
my summation is that
if you want to see a powerful 
happy 
sad 
beautiful story ?
watch ... ... preferably own this film ...
