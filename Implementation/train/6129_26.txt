i saw this film last night on cable
and it is extraordinary .
what i love most about it is that it is understated and low-key 
but deeply heartfelt .
henry thomas '
( he played the child in e.t . )
performance is masterfully inarticulate
( he is supposed to be a man of few word ) .
david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain .
and miraculously
( given
that we are talking about a hollywood product here )
a baby serves as a main character 
but one
who does not act or have line ,
but rather just is (
and is luminous at that ) .
interesting to note that thomas ' mysterious relationship w. e.t .
was the core of that film ;
while his bond w. the baby serves as the core of `` a good baby .
`` then there is the music
-- ah ,
what music ! !
gillian welch 's tune are wonderful
and the entire score is gorgeous hill country music.this film is wonderfully atmospheric .
i recommend it highly .
