not a very good movie
but according to the info
it is pretty accurate in depicting torture technique .
the purpose of the film was to show the utality of the nk pow camp
and that is done effectively enough 
with surprising frankness for the time .
whatever technical flaw exist
( and there are plenty )
by watching this you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again ,
nasty
because it is being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bay.i do not think
any of the korean veteran ought up his torture
when running for office ,
and if you watch the movie like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam film .
i do not know
if it was the person in '54
being trapped in the wwii concept
( the boy tend to wisecrack a lot )
or the war or what ,
but it is interesting to see this from the same system
that 16 year later would be making movie like `` go tell the spartan '' .
