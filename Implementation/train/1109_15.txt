when i noticed that `` hamish macbeth '' was being oadcast in the united state ,
i was thrilled .
i then had the misfortune
to watch the darn thing .
i adore m. c. beaton 's book about the wonderful scottish constable .
the character in the book are entertaining and very well-written .
the power
that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently
have never have read one of beaton 's book .
only the name `` hamish macbeth '' has anything to do with the series .
besides the lack of familiar character ,
i find the whole show offensively loud .
it seems that the actor feel
they must shout their line and scream at each other .
if you love m. c. beaton 's adorable hamish macbeth do not waste your time on this rubbish .
