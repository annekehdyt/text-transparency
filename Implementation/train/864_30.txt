i read in the paper
that w.snipe was oke so no wonder
he would take part in low budget project
like the contractor.he is just the next action star
to join a growing club :
the penniless action star of the 90s
( van damme 
segal 
lundgren 
snipe ) .
here he star the lead in a cheap action flick
which was shot in bulgaria
( we are supposed to believe
that the location is london ,
like only a complete moron would buy that )
the story is the one of 1000 other movie :
retired special force good guy gets hired by the government again
to do a wet job-
after that government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away
after killing bad guy
( was that a spoiler ?
guess not ! )
the star of the movie :
the little girl
( eliza bennett )
outperforms everybody else of the cast ! !
! one star is for her plus one star for eye candy lena headey ,
makes 2 star .
only for die hard snipe fan ! everybody else :
avoid !
