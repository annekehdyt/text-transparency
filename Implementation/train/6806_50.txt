vince lombardi high school has a new principal
-- the evil ms. togar
( mary woronov ) .
she intends to ban rock and roll music all together .
she butts head with riff randall
( p.j .
sole )
who loves the ramone .
also the head of the school football team
( vincent van patten )
can not seem to connect with any girl
-- not realizing cute kate rambeau
( dey young )
is in love with him.an instant midnight movie .
this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed
-- but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit
and kept playing all through the 1980s .
i remember
attending more than a few of those
when i was in college
-- it was like a party !
person were singing along with the song 
laughing uproariously at every joke
and generally just having fun.seeing
it now as an adult i can not imagine why i loved this so much .
the script is juvenile and full of groaner
that i could not believe
i was hearing .
character change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place .
what saves this are some truly funny line and wonderful performance by sole and woronov
( who is really enjoying herself ) .
also everyone is full of energy
and playing their role way over the top
( as they should ) .
as for the ramone ... i was never a fan .
i do like the title tune
but the rest of the song never really caught me .
if you are a ramone fan
you might give this a higher rating.spoiler warning ! ! ! !
this is mostly for kid
( it has a pg rating )
who will probably find it silly but fun .
i especially think
they will like the end
when the high school is blown up !
spoiler end ! ! !
! so ,
if you are in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this .
otherwise stay away .
i give it a 7 .
