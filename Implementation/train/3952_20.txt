since i first saw this in the theater
it has been my favorite .
since then i have seen
it countless time and i never get tired of it .
the setting has a lot
to do with it
( the colorado i know would be jealous ) ,
but the storyline is original and i liked
how it used small town mountain folk as the hero .
there has not been a movie i can compare this too .
john lithgow plays a smart villain ,
but i love how he is completely out of his element
-- he has to follow tucker around
and that is what keeps it interesting .
this is an action movie at it is best .
i do not think
i will see another
that is so entertaining.you do not need 50,000 round fired to qualify as an action movie .
it just has to keep you captivated 
not shell-shocked .
