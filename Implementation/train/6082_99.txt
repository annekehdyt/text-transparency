the opening flourish left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the archer ' logo 
the introductory disclaimer 
the way the camera pans over the cosmos .
it is strange to think
that `it is a wonderful life '
came out in the same year .
no great coincidence :
the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth film ;
but the glowing cotton wool nebula and cutesy angel of the competition look tattered 
something best passed over in silence ,
when placed next to alfred junge 's vision.it continues to look great all the way
through 
as more and more striking idea are sprung upon us .
i am not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general .
one of the two visual scheme almost always looks ugly
when placed next to the other .
not so here .
powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour
as if it is the most natural thing in the world 
a mere change of palette .
both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own.as for the story ...
this may be pressburger 's best script ,
or at least it would have been had
the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding event .
other than that it is tight ,
yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here .
was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary ?
( or both ?
perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy
that was ,
as it so happened 
true . )
everyone says
we are meant to neither ask nor answer this question ,
but i do not see why .
i am sure we are meant to ask the question .
the film even gives us clue
as to what the answer is - indeed ,
the problem is that there are too many clue
and they seem at first to be pointing in different direction .
the fact
that other thing ought to occupy our attention as well does
not mean that this should not occupy us as well .
there is ,
as i have said
before ,
a lot going on.consider the scene
in which aaham farlan
( heaven 's prosecuting lawyer )
plays a radio oadcast of a cricket match ,
and contemptuously says 
`the voice of england 
1945 . '
dr. reeve
( the defence )
acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment ,
and then produces one of his own :
a blue song from america ,
which farlan listens to as though
he is got a lemon in his mouth .
reeve looks smug.snobbery ?
well 
i do not see
why it is snobbish to condemn blue music -
and that is not what powell and pressburger are doing 
anyway .
as the song is being played ,
we get a shot of the american soldier
listening to it :
several of them nod their head to the rhythm 
perfectly at home .
they do not find it incomprehensible .
there is something valuable about the song
and neither reeve nor farlan knows
what it is .
reeve probably realises as much .
all english audience
( and all australian 
indian 
etc .
audience as well ) know without being told
that there is something of value in the cricket oadcast 
too ;
and that
while reeve understand that ,
he is unable to explain it to farlan -
hence the blue oadcast ,
which shows
that person can understand each other
without sharing an understanding of everything else .
it is a clever scene.one last thing .
i found david niven a bit cold ,
without the charisma
he would acquire later in his career ;
but even so 
i do not think
a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly
after the action began ,
as this one did .
