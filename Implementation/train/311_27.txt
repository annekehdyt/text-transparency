there are many problem with mystery man .
first of all there are too many different character for all of them
to be given complex or even interesting personality .
the special effect detract from the story and are not really that special .
paul reuben is wasted in a pathetic ,
juvenile role as a character
who merely fart
and speak in an inaudible accent.now onto the decent part .
william h macy 
three heavenly word 
and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect .
the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character
who is only mysterious
and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs .
ben stiller is very amusing as well ,
showing a weak character
trying to make it into the big league of superhero .
all of the character do ,
and that is an area
which i found particuarly ironic .
that is because all of the actor are indie film actor
trying to make it into the big league of hollywood.to be honest ,
the reason i thought
it failed at the box-office is that america does not get irony.all in all i loved the film ,
but i feel
it would have worked better
if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscape and effect .
