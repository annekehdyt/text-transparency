the film maybe goes a little far ,
but if you love the show
it is what you expect .
it is not a bad movie ;
it is actually pretty good .
if you do not like the show ,
do not see the movie .
it starts off a little slow maybe ,
but then picks up
and turns out to be pretty funny .
there are even a few `` heart-wrenching '' scene toward the end .
after all the protagonist have gone
through these scence do get to you .
also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets person
and justifies his show 's existience .
he is got a pretty good point .
we care so much about the private detail of celeity life ,
so why is it wrong
that these person tell their private life on national tv 
too .
if they were celeity we would not mind at all ,
we 'd eat it up .
do we not like his guest doing this just
because they are poor white trash
and it reminds us
that there really is poverty in this world
and not just rich glamous movie star
living in a `` leave it to beaver '' world ?
