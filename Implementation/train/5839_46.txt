as a big fan of gorilla movie in general 
i anticipated
that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effect ,
they were quite good ,
however -
that is the only thing
i can write about this flop .
the film claim to be based on a true story but in effect ,
it does not even come close to what actually happened to `` buddy '' -
who in real life ,
was the famous gargantua ,
sold to ringling bros. by our supposed `` heroic '' gertrude lintz ,
known by many animal enthusiast as a woman
who hardly had her animal ' welfare in the best interest .
as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive ,
this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla 
in real life 
resort to such behavior .
buddy did 
in fact 
escape his wooden crate
( not a plush cage room
as depicted in movie )
during a storm ,
to seek shelter and comfort in the house ,
which frightened gertrude lintz into selling him .
no 
buddy was not released into a gorilla family
surrounded by lush tree in a zoological paradise -
he was abandoned in a wooden crate 
deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus -
where he actually lived a better life
having peanut thrown at him
until he died
( historically the oldest living gorilla on record 
by the way )
before a show in miami .
notice also 
in the film 
how buddy grow older
but the chimpanzee never age .
( the chimp 
by the way 
were not raised simultaneously with other animal ,
including buddy 
as portrayed in the film )
