devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact
that it is on the dpp 'video nasty ' list ,
but it really need n't have been .
many film on the list where there for god
( and dpp )
only known reason ,
and while this is not the tamest of the bunch ;
there is not a lot here
that warrant banning ...
which is a shame
because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact
that it is on 'the shopping list ' .
the plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal film -
and it follows an actress
who is kidnapped
and dragged off into the amazon jungle .
a hunter is then hired to find her ,
but along the way he has to ave the native ,
lead by a man
who calls himself `` the devil ''
( hence the title ) .
the film basically just plod along for eighty five minute
and there really are not many scene of interest .
it is a real shame
that jess franco ended up making film like this
because the man clearly has talent ;
as seen by film such as the diabolical dr z 
venus in fur 
faceless
and she kills in ecstasy ,
but unfortunately his good film are just gem amongst heap of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap .
i saw this film purely
because i want to be able to say
i have seen everything on the dpp 's list
( just two more to go !
) ,
and i am guessing
that is why most other person
who have seen it ,
saw it .
but if you are not on the lookout for nasty ;
there really is no reason to bother with this one .
