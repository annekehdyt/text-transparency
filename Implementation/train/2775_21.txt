i wanted to like this film ,
yes its a saw 
blah blah blah ripoff but i like those film .
if done well this had all the ingredient
of being a good 
not illiant ,
but good film ... .unfortunately those ingredient had gone off !
the acting was terrible ,
and this was first seen
when the captive are introduced with their captor one by one
( hood taken off ) ,
the remark and one liner are just terrible ,
yes i know ,
bad writing ... .but this is more than that ,
it was bad writing coupled with bad acting .
two of the captive had been in a relationship with each other
and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film ... ..sorry ,
im even wondering
why i am bothering to review this movie at all.i will end with plot hole 
plot hole and more plot hole !
disappointing !
