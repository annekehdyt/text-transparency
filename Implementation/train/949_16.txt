this movie was boring !
yes 
there are a few funny moment and joke ,
but you can not base a whole movie on that !
the character are too stereotyped ,
there is no real story -
but short episode with freaky side-character ,
who are not freaky enough
to make the plot genuine.shame ,
because most of the actor are acknowledged in hungary ,
a mystery why
they took the role .
this is *not* a new hope for the hungarian film .
it was boring ,
though it was meant to be genuine or unique .
they could have tried much more harder than this ... 2/10
