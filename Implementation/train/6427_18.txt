i rented this movie
because it falls under the genre of `` romance '' and `` western '' with some grand canyon scenery
thrown in .
but if you are expecting a typical wholesome romantic western ,
forget it .
this movie is pure trash !
the romance is between a young girl
who has not even gone through puberty and a middle-aged man !
the child is also lusted after by other leering man .
it is sickening.peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous
by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shield ,
and her character is mostly the one
that pursues the relationship .
he tries to shoo her off at first
but eventually he gives in
and they drive off as a happy 
loving couple .
it is revolting.i do not see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophile .
