while i am not a big fan of musical ,
i have loved the film of fred astaire and ginger roger
because they are just so much fun .
sure 
they can be a bit formulaic ,
but even though you know what is going to happen ,
they still are very pleasing to watch .
however ,
despite this ,
i was a bit disappointed in this outing .
part of it was because this film does not have the wonderful
supporting cast like you
saw in top hat
or shall we dance .
without edward everett horton or eric blore ,
the film seems to be a bit lacking
-- especially in the `` fun '' department .
the silly antic of these supporting actor gave the other film charm
that you just do not get with follow the fleet .
in addition 
unlike the usual character
played by astaire ,
this one is more of a jerk
-- as his fat head gets roger into trouble again and again .
and 
as a result 
it is a lot harder to like him or want
to see them get together in the end of the film .
plus ,
although the music is by irving berlin ,
the song just do not seem as memorable .
in fact 
none of the song were all
that special and i can not recall any of them
even though i just saw the movie .
while this is still a cute and worthwhile film ,
it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other film .
good but far from great .
