i am a big beatle fan .
my favorite beatle is paul
and my least favorite is john .
i already knew quite a bit about the beatle music and the truth behind the eakup 
as well as thing like john lennon 's family and paul 's band wing .
i was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between john and paul so many year
after the eakup.i was not disappointed by this movie .
although the story itself is fiction 
many of the reference
that the two musician used were very accurate .
these included how yoko ono would always be with john wherever
he went 
the wing song `` silly love song ''
being the number one hit
that year and the concert on the roof of apple studio
playing music from the album `` let it be .
`` the actor did a very good job in playing john and paul .
the accent could had used maybe a bit more work ,
but they seemed to act a lot like i have read the two former-beatle used to act like .
i also liked the dialogue between them ,
which was basically what the entire movie was.the ending at first disappointed me ,
but the more you think
about it the more you will appreciate it ,
especially since this was how it really went in real life .
they also show the fantastic skit from `` saturday night live ''
in which the beatle are offered $ 3,000 to perform on the show .
( as compared to the $ 220 million other were offering them ) overall ,
i was not disappointed with this movie .
it does really give you more of a feel
for why the beatle oke up and why
they never got back together .
