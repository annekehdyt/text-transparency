i am a current a.s.l .
student and was forced to watch this movie in class ,
and what i got out of it was the blatant bias
involved in the film .
the film is obviously leaning toward to p.o.v .
of the `` common deaf perception '' their is no middle ground .
also 
the film did not make mention or take into account other situation
that are also under debate in this topic .
i.e .
deaf person
who were born hearing and later went deaf .
is it right or wrong in that instance ?
the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w/ a capital `` d '' .
not that this is bad ,
but for it to be a true documentary film
is should attempt to be slightly unbiased .
