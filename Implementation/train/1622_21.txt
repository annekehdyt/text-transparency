i saw this movie on tv late one night year ago ,
but it was a disturbing experience
that has stayed with me to this day.the premise may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake 
a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hill above a small town is eached ,
and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply .
the inhabitant of the town begin to lose their ability
to exercise restraint over every whim and base desire
that floats through all of our mind from time to time ,
and that normally we know
we simply must not act upon.the pace of the movie is slow ,
but for me that only added to the creeping unease
as the townspeople 's behaviour slowly starts to unravel .
there are several surreal and very unsettling scene
that have remained etched in my memory all this time.it raises interesting question
about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most feral instinct .
did i enjoy it ?
i am not sure 'enjoy ' is the right word .
did it make me think ?
definitely .
i am still thinking about it .
scary stuff .
