it is no wonder this movie won 4 price ,
it is a movie
that lingers to any soul ,
it is not a wonder
why it took paul reiser 20 year
to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea .
i can understand every part of it ,
this is a movie
that will make you cry just a tear 
or thousands.story :
10/10
when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him
to find something else his son
and him take out on a road trip
to find her ,
and while they do
that they find something lost 
friendship 
family 
and affection for each other .
at the beginning you know what going to happen ,
but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end ,
it is a ride between a father and his son 
and a husband and his wife .
it is no wonder
it took paul reiser 20 year to write this beautiful romance/comedy.actor :
10/10 well you can not say anything else
that what i about to say ,
hey it is with peter falk in it ,
he is a legend everything
he does in movie are magic ,
when you use peter falk in a romance/comedy what do you think
you get ?
a perfect outcome 
it is no wonder this movie is that perfect
and won that many price .
as the son paul reiser does an excellent job ,
although he is not a great actor
always
that does not mean that this did not work
actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son 
the rest of the cast is good enough
but you do not see them as much so just say
they do what they shall to get this to shine even more .
music :
10/10 it does not always work
when using music sometimes
it just does not fit
but that is not the thing in this movie ,
the music is perfect in tune ,
it makes the movie even more compelling .
this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other part 
a great soundtrack for a romance/comedy thats for sure.overall :
10/10 there are so many romance/comedy movie out on tape 
dvds 
blu-ray and what not ,
but this movie is one of the special one .
it does not happen everyday
that you can create a story like this ,
it takes year
thinking about this
and the fact is that actually what it took to make it 
a great piece
that should be bought
and kept into the human soul ,
see it
when you get old
and see it with your father at a old age ,
i think
then this movie will spark like no other ever made .
