now this show looks like most of the other show
of it is type from the mid-90 's ,
but the only thing is about this one is
that it is different ,
they use a lot of comedy and action in this one
and maybe a little bit of drama too .
i personally thought
it was a good show ,
i can not understand
why would they cancel it .
the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date.my hope is that the wb ing back the show or even do a movie ,
which
i know
is gon na be impossible to do ,
but hey it does not hurt to dream ,
does not it ? anyway ,
i would recommend
if you had not seen it
to find the dvd of all 13 episode ,
because the character are great ,
the story line are good ,
the comedy is good
and well the whole show is just great .
