my title above says it all .
let me make it clearer .
if you have seen the bbc 's `` planet earth '' ,
which i am sure most of you have ,
then you are not gon na like this movie too much .
and i own all the discs of `` planet earth '' i had seen the rating for this movie very high ,
and read good review about it .
i was excited to check it out.alas ,
i went to the theater and the movie started ,
i saw
it was a disney movie with production company listing bbc and discovery .
and when they started the first scene about the polar bear ,
i recognized them from my dvds at home of `` planet earth '' .the movie continued
and went on and on and on ,
me and my friend kept on recognizing
the scene
were all from `` planet earth '' .we were very very disappointed ,
as i think
90 % of the footage is from `` planet earth '' .
i am saying 90 % ,
because some of the scene i did not recognize .
i have a feeling
that i simply did not remember them.so
finally what this movie really is ,
is a compilation of different footage from the different discs of `` planet earth '' 
with a narration
aimed at kid .
yes 
the narration is quite kiddish .
let me give you an example .
when they show the polar cub walking away from the mother cub ,
the narrator says
`` the polar cub are not like human kid .
they do not always listen to their mother ''
( i do not remember the exact word ,
but this is how it is ) so in a nutshell .
this is condensed `` planet earth '' for kid !
