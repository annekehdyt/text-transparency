adam jone has a illiant sense of humor .
there is nothing
i did not like about this film .
cross eyed was beautifully shot .
adam does a great job of ,
not only developing the main character ,
but also the minor character .
cross eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there .
that you do not have to spend a lot to create something worth watching .
there is something to like for everyone .
if you have had a terrible roommate .
if you have ever picked on a dork in high school .
if you have ever parked anywhere in the city .
if you have any type of sense of humor at all
you will love this film .
this is the type of film
that will be around for a long time
and ends up resurfacing again
once adam makes a bigger name for himself .
i look forward to adam 's future project .
