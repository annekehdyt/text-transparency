this is kind of a weird movie ,
given
that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space
and fight against satan and his minion ...
but it is still kinda fun.it has some genuine laugh ...
whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable 
though .
this movie is not good ,
but i can say
i really enjoyed watching it.i would recommend this movie over `` santa claus conquers the martian '' 
`` santa claus '' with dudley moore and john lithgow 
or `` the santa clause '' with tim allen .
