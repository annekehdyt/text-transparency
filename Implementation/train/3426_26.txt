this movie is funny and suitable for any age .
it is definitely family-type entertainment .
the cast does a fine job
playing folk in the mid-western town of big bean 
illinois .
where we must assume
nothing ever happens since the excitement
( pre-invasion )
of the decade is the new
( and only )
exit ramp from the interstate .
the location appeal as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martian .
but these martian are totally inept ,
despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapon ...
including one set on eradicating the martian 
too !
the martian dead-pan their line and throw in just the right accent
to make us the viewer and the local wish
to help them ...
leave earth .
j. j. anderson
playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck
has just great line .
watch this movie for laugher and entertainment ;
thought-provoking it is not .
but subtle and enjoyable it is .
