marilyn miller made only three film
before her untimely death - the marvelous sally
( 1929 ) ,
the comedy her majesty love
( 1931 )
and this trifle - sunny
( 1930 ) .
it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical -
although she has four dance number ,
she only sings two song
( who ?
and one man alone ) .
the rest of the score
including the spritely title tune
are jettisoned ,
although we can hear the latter in the background scoring .
miller looks overweight
and amateurish here - no star quality at all .
even her dancing is cloutish .
the film is very badly written 
stock full of stale and unfunny joke and stupid situation .
if you are interested in miller as a performer ,
by all mean ,
check it out ,
but for general entertainment 
stay away .
