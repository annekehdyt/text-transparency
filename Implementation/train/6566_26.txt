i have seen a lot of saura film
and always found amazing the way
he assembles music 
dance 
drama and great cinema in his movie .
ib\u00e9ria shows an even better saura 
dealing with multimedia concept and a more contemporary concept of dance and music .
another thing
that called my attention
is the fact
that 
in this movie 
dancer and musician 
dance and music 
are equally important :
the camera shows various aspect of music interpretation 
examining not only technical issue
but also the emotional experience of playing .
the interest of saura on the idge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient
in turning this movie
maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other work .
that is why i recommend it strongly to those
who love good cinema 
good music 
good dance 
great art .
