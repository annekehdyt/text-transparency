melissa 's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner
and she is just discovering her sexuality with boy .
but it turns out
that all the guy
that she spends time with all wind
up murdered in this generic '80 's slasher film .
it is up to the local town sheriff dan burke
( bo hopkin 
the wild bunch )
and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter 
marci
( dana kimmell 
friday the 13th part 3 ) ,
to get to the bottom of these killing.thi film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspect of the movie and less on the killing themselves
and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it is '80 's slasher ethren .
it does not hurt
that alesia has a great body
( i feel the need
to stress the obvious with stating
that the actress is over 18 and thus convey
that i am not overly perverted ) .
on the downside 
the movie is hampered with a few plot point
that are underdeveloped and unnecessary 
a grating theme some
that is used a bit too often ,
and an ending
that is a tad anti-climatic .
but the good outweigh the bad
( barely ) .
give this a rent ,
but i would not buy it.eye candy :
