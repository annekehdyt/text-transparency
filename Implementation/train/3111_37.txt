even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle
that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s ,
ant falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective
( though entertaining for reason it was not intending ) .
it is sooooo preposterous .
apparently these ant
that are bulldozed near an inn
have been eating poisonous waste for decade
and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bite - hundred of these bite
being fatal .
watching actor of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black speck is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way .
so many scene just look ludicrous :
a boy
trying to fall in a dumpster whilst
being attacked ,
suzanne sommer crying out in horror
while lounging in bed 
robert foxworth and lynda george eathing through piece of wallpaper 
bernie casey faking a gam leg ,
and the list goes on and on .
the peril shown range from ant crawling from a drain to black line of ant all over the wall .
the cast for the film is not bad on paper ,
but none of these actor seem to believe in the material .
poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror .
i hope
she found a good use for the money ,
for it is obvious
that was the only reason
a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense .
although it is quite a bad film ,
it is watchable - once for me ,
and does have many of those seventy bad film quality - start-studded actor embarrassing themselves ,
that made-for-tv feel ,
and the dreaded creature of nature reeking vengeance on man .
this time man must push his hand into a pile of ant
to be affected .
really quite dreadful .
