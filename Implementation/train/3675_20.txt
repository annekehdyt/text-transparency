as far as the muppet line goes 
however 
this is not the best 
nor the second best .
this was marketed towards the kiddy ,
but has some dark 
and emotionally upsetting adult moment ,
to which parent may not wish to expose their child .
one of which showcases miss piggy going `` postal '' in a jealous rage ,
which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.beyond
that 
however 
the story is progressive ,
and highly entertaining .
one scene
in which joan river and miss piggy go berserk in a department store
is simply hilarious !
and there are other part of this work
which contain the same level of levity and fun.i like this very much ,
and enjoy it still today.it rate a 7.6/10 from ... the fiend : .
