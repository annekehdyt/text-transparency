this is what a movie should be
when trying to capture the essence of that
which is very surreal .
it has this hazy overtone
that is rarely captured on film ,
it feels like a dream sequence
and really move you into a dark haunting memory .
the kid were extremely believable
and i do expect some thing to come of them in the future .
very natural acting for such young one ,
i do not know
if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good ,
but no the less excellent .
bill scored as far
as i am concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr. paxton bad acting ,
what can one do in that role .
he played the part rather well in my opinion .
this is coming from someone
who said
hamlet was good
( the ethan hawke version ? )
wow ... ... ... do not listen to his comment .
great flick
to make you feel
really uncomfortable ,
if that is what you want ?
cinematography gets an above the average rating also .
