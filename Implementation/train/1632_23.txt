this is a great story
and was just the beginning of equality in the united state .
( we are still working on it too . )
however
despite the fact this is true ,
it is still a movie
and this is a movie site .
i realize
independent film have a hard time
getting good actor 
but wow .
the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis .
but even he could not make up for all the actor
( including the one
playing him as a young man )
absolutely atrocious acting .
granted the script was terribly clich\u00e9 ,
but even then you have got to get some decent actor !
i would not recommand this to anybody
because it is so poorly done in every category .
read some book about the true story of the u.s.s mason ,
because they give these man the respect
they deserve .
