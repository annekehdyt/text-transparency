i just have to add ,
in case anyone actually reads this and has not completely gotten the point yet .
these other reviewer are not joking around ,
this really is the worst colour movie
you are likely to ever see .
when the movie started i could not believe
something like this actually made it out for the world to see.they are not just saying it
when they said
it looks like a home movie .
it really does .
like the `` director '' took the family hi8 camcorder
( before dv camera and computer non-linear editing ) ,
no other equipment
( light 
sound gear 
etc ) ,
grabbed some decent-looking acting student ,
and went out to shoot a movie .
no script ,
just making it up
as he went along.when i watched it ,
it was on my mono tv ,
so i only have one channel of audio
( left of right speaker ) .
at first i thought i would hooked it up wrong .
the movie was silent
until someone spoke a couple of minute in .
i got up and switched over to the other channel
and suddenly i could hear music and sound effect
but then could not hear the dialog .
they recorded the sound on different bloody channel !
i mean 
there is movie
that can be funny to watch ,
so bad they are good 
kind of thing .
i am not sure this is one of those .
i mean 
i will admit to being a bit of a budding film maker .
and seeing bad movie just makes you want to go out there
and prove
you can do it better ,
you know .
but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.as bad
as they were ,
the actor are the only good thing about this .
i thought
the chick was hot
and was disappointed in the evity of her bath scene .
a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing
to maybe a 3 or 4. but ala 
no .
if you want to make a movie
but it is turning out crap 
throw in some gratuitous nudity .
worked for roger corman .
