i agree with other user comment
in that the two main role were well acted ,
that being the guy
that played gary gillmore and giovanni 's role .
too bad the story was so boring .
not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore
before the movie so i did not know what to expect .
i thought
it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber
but how wrong i was .
the whole movie was just talking ,
talking and talking about their mom and dad .
the only cool scene were the flashback
where the dad would lose his temper .
that was the only interest i got from this borefest .
