creature comfort in america should have been released on a different network ,
or at least been given the chance
to have its full run of episode .
unfortunately 
this was not the case .
given that american audience
( seemingly )
have the attention span of a gnat
when it comes to the humor
that does not consist of profanity laced diatribe ,
or has a preoccupation with scatological function
( both sound and smell ) ,
shows like this will be few and far between .
one of the main problem was
that however illiant it was ,
it was made for a rarefied audience
who knew what to expect
but was viewed by an audience and board room
that did not have a clue at to what they were watching .
which is sad 
but not unexpected .
i would have liked to have seen at least three more season of this show
even if it was produced for direct dvd release .
the material and the interaction between the creature were rich with sub context
and there were other conversation
just waiting to be had under the surface .
but thank to political correctness 
such conversation take place only in my mind .
