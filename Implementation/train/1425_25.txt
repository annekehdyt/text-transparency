fido is a story about more well mannered zombie
who have been trained
to serve the human race .
all falls apart though ,
when young timmy 's zombie fido eats the family neighbor .
from then on 
disaster
( well ,
maybe not disaster ,
but to some extent 
chaos ) occurs .
most of the person treat their zombie with fairness 
and one such character sleep with his zombie
( very funny part of the movie ,
if not also very disturbing too ) .
and we find the loving fido whatever
he may do .
this is a very funny and unique film 
especially for the zombie genre .
it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movie
( no negativity in this statement ) .
i very much recommend it to person
who are looking for something funny and different .
i rate this 8/10 .
rated r for zombie related violence
