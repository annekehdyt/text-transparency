i just viewed murder at the vanity in the newly-released universal pre-code set ,
and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end .
most of the other commentator have covered the story 
a murder mystery within a musical ,
but i wanted to add a few additional note .
brisson and carlisle are relatively bland ,
compared to even most of the minor player ,
and neither one really seems to have the proper voice
for what they are singing
( carlisle being a trained opera singer 
brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low note ) .
the great victor mclaglen and jack oakie play well off each other 
with an excellent sense of timing
that keeps the ball rolling between musical number .
yes 
lucille ball and ann sheridan are vanity girl ,
but let 's not forget the splendid jazz singer ernestine anderson in the `` ebony rhapsody '' number .
gail patrick makes one of her early appearance 
sounding a bit like eve arden ;
patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series .
then there is jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistress
-- you will spot her also in david copperfield
( as aunt peggoty )
and the bank dick .
the music is very good
-- brisson introducing the standard `` cocktail for two '' in two different scene ;
`` sweet marihuana '' with barely clad peyote button girl in the background
( blood dripping on one chorine 's white skin was wonderfully chilling ) ;
the `` ebony rhapsody 
'' with duke ellington 's orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancer 
both black and white 
mixing it up .
and i believe
this is one of the only early musical
to feature such a mix
-- and the costume leave nothing to the imagination .
