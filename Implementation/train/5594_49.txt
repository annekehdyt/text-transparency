i can not believe how many person hate hal spark !
he was my favorite host of the show 
hands down .
i hate celeity gossip and generally dislike talk show ,
but
when hal spark hosted talk soup ,
it was must see tv for me .
i rarely missed an episode during his run ,
and was saddened
when the guest host started pouring in
( although most of the guest still did a fine job ) .
anyway 
for all the person
who dislike hal spark ,
i imagine
they must have never seen the weekend special .
they were hour long episode of talk soup
that comprised the best clip from the entire week ,
and were padded out by sketch comedy bit .
the original bit
that hal spark did were hilarious .
in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon ,
and in an exorcist like scene his head spun
as he told dated joke about airline food .
one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity ,
as a bunch of cloned hal spark kept multiplying through out the episode 
over-running the studio.ok 
maybe these do not sound as funny
when i describe them ,
but all i know is that besides talk soup 
the only other two show i watched consistently
during those year was the simpson and late night with conan o'brian .
so if you like the comedy styling of those show ,
then you would probably like talk soup during the spark year.that said ,
henson and tyler were both great host as well .
all three host ought something different to the table
but they were all fine comedian in my opinion .
of course 
throughout the tyler and guest star year 
my interest in this show began to wane ,
but every now and then i catch the soup 
the show 's spiritual successor ,
and sure enough ,
the new host can ing some pretty unexpected laugh from time to time.ok ,
i have wasted enough time
talking about a tv show
that is not on the air anymore and on a channel
that i generally despise .
go watch something else !
