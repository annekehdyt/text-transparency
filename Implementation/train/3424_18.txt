i saw this movie at sundance 2005
and was stunned at how bad it was ,
although based on the catalog description i was excited to see it .
supposedly a `` mockumentary '' of two high school student
making a documentary of high school life ,
it featured bad acting ,
bad directing ,
completely lack of engaging character as written ,
and all-around is a total bust .
i love good movie about high school ,
and this is not one of them .
the character are one-dimensional and self-consciously `` cool '' although they are supposed to be outcast .
you get the overall impression of a bunch of person
sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie
to show their friend ,
yet somehow
it got into sundance .
mystifying .
