the second care bear movie is immensely better than its predecessor .
it has a deeper plot ,
better character development 
and the tune
( especially the closing song )
are both catchy and warm-hearted .
sure the movie tends to over stress caring
but come on ,
it is a care bear movie .
this movie is a great picture
to show to kid
because it emphasizes friendship 
love 
and again 
caring .
not to mention the care bear are just too adorable !
