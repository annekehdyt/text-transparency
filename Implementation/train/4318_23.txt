i stumbled upon nine dead recently
and read the current review thinking
i could deal with an average movie .
this movie however was slightly below average 
yet watchable .
the script was poorly written
and the acting was at average for a b-level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good .
the plot border on that of saw 
teach person what they did wrong in a situation
and try to make them appreciate life more ,
but that is really where the comparison ends .
nine dead try to have heart and purpose behind simple idea
that are not new .
the main fault
that i found in nine dead ,
was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashback
that occurred 3 minute before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending
that person will not see coming ,
in a bad way .
barring any spoiler i have seen the worse of bad movie
and even they did not end this poorly .
decent flick 
bad acting and ending though ...
