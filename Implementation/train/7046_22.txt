boy 
this was one lousy movie !
while i have not seen all of the burton/taylor collaboration ,
i can say with confidence
that this is the worst .
this rich but ill woman
( taylor 
of course )
owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ,
ruling over a put-upon staff
when she is suddenly visited by this traveling poet ,
who mouths platitude .
in fact 
the whole film is just a talk fest ,
with much of the talk making no sense .
even in 1968 
no one could make head or tail of this pretentious nonsense ,
and the passage of time makes that even more clear .
if it were not for the beautiful cinematography and scenery ,
it would deserve a negative rating .
the only thing this film is good
for is its unintentional laugh at the expense of the star .
