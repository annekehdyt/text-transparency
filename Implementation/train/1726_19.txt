`` who loves the sun ''
works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace
to keep the story
not only engaging 
but often hilarious .
it is been a while
since i have found such a thoroughly touching 
thoroughly enjoyable film .
the film is gorgeous ,
drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscape .
the peaceful imagery contrast wonderfully with the tension between the very human 
very flawed 
and yet very likable character .
due to the excellent cast all five of the major player are wonderfully interesting and dynamic .
i recommend `` who loves the sun . ''
it is a really funny movie
that takes a poignant look at the hurt
that we can inflict on each other ,
and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness .
