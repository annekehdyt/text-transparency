stan and ollie become sap at sea
when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer.the boy are wonderful in this feature ,
which starts out with one of their most hilarious set piece 
the horn factory .
always a few step out of sync with the rest of creation 
laurel and hardy inhabit a world
where icy radio and bedded billy goat are the rule 
not the exception .
with its ief length 
the film is more in style with their classic short subject ,
which explains its episodic nature.only the boy get screen credit ,
but movie maven will recognize other familiar faces :
jame finlayson appears as a loony doctor ,
richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role ,
sweet mary gordon plays the boy ' perplexed neighbor .
that is charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk
and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber.one of the film 's script writer was silent comedian harry langdon.stan
and ollie are the main focus 
however .
watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn 
or laurel 's antic with banana 
for instance 
reminds the viewer
why
these fellow remain absolute cinematic giant .
