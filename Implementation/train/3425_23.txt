redline is a knockoff of fast and furious ,
without any of the redeeming quality .
it does not need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twist and surprise ,
but it needs something !
this is the equivalent of a porn film ,
where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 second at the beginning and the same at the end .
except that this is worse ,
because you do not get your money 's worth .
mind-numbingly boring 
impossible race sequence 
and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful car ,
which almost acquire negative point for having appeared in this movie .
sure 
she is hot ,
but who 's that desperate for an on screen female ?
i feel
like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippet ,
and shook an 8 ball every time
they switched scene .
no serious person
who races or knows anything about it
would watch this movie
and enjoy the race scene .
