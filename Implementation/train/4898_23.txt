i just watched this film again
and remain dismayed at the number of cynic
who dismiss it as just new age pap .
a great film 
one
that takes its time
to develop ,
it keeps coming close to going over the edge
but never does
and ultimately is meditative 
affecting 
and truer to life than most films person
who dismiss its `` coincidence ''
can see .
i was angry at the time
that movie like `` prince of tide '' and `` bugsy ''
( though i liked the latter )
were nominated for best picture that year
( let alone that `` silence of the lambs '' won ! )
and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay .
upon revisiting it ,
i think
history support my initial reaction !
