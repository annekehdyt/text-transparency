this stylistically sophisticated visual game
present \u0091a story within a story ' .
the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever
who fights persistently with his new text \u0096
which is 
at the same time 
the screenplay of the film we are watching .
in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing
the script of the film bart 's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme ,
as does the environment of the flat
where he works
and takes care of his little girl .
the intimate environment offer ample opportunity for game of illusion
involving space 
light 
colour and a couple of cat .
the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimension of a text
continually influenced by the filmmaker 's intervention ,
which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment .
the constantly changing viewing angle complicate answer to question
which arise :
what is \u0091truth ' and what \u0091illusion ' ?
which of the observed world is primary and superior to the rest ?
can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space ?
