a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life :
one as a `` happily '' married man with a ten year oldish child 
the other as a sex fiend .
the bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive day
and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist ,
listening to his story and intelligently probing him .
nastassja 's role is very restrictive
and she is the only principal adult character
who does not take off her clothe .
if she had ,
i would have rated this movie a big fat `` f. ''
as it is ,
it rate an f+ ,
implying
that it is still a failure unless one likes
to be bored .
it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minute cleaning out the garage .
`` diary of a sex addict '' falls into the category of film
that
once one has seen it ,
one wishes
that one had not .
