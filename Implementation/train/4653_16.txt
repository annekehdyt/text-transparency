i watched this on the movie with my girlfriend at the time and i can say
that i did not have the best time
mainly because i did not know about ned kelly or his story.but since this is a biopic ,
it is important to at least know what to expect from the character.i do not know
if the manner the event are told are true ,
or if it everything is fictional .
but the way ned kelly is portrayed
as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true .
i do not think
he is portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief ,
but that is just my opinion.this is a solid western-type movie for everybody 's taste .
heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.give this movie a chance
if it airs on cable .
otherwise 
i do not think
i could recommend it .
