as a physic student 
i have become aware of many idiot professor 
and other so-called expert 
in the field .
as i continue with my study ,
i learn more and more about real physic experiment going on ,
and about the person
who are doing thing right.then ,
my friend tell me of this `` physic movie ''
they want to see .
knowing nothing of it ,
i am excited ,
hoping
that the information will be presented well.i
have done real quantum mechanic ;
this was not it.this movie starts with the basic assumption
that anything
that occurs to a subatomic particle can ,
and will ,
occur to you ,
if you just open your eye .
let 's think
about that 
for just a moment.our body are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particle .
that is a million billion billion billion particle !
the more `` mysterious '' quantum effect of just two particle can have a 50 % probability of cancelling each other out completely .
as you add more and more particle into the mix ,
it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result .
to tell us to believe
that this is a valid assumption ,
with no rationality behind it ...
it is just stupid.my friend 
also in physic 
and i counted 3 fact during the course of this movie .
but they were presented in the most misleading manner
i have ever seen.i can not say as much for the neural portion of the movie ,
as i have not had any kind of medical training .
it seemed
as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it 
remembering my day in biology ,
but i can not say.at least this film had a redeeming quality :
the dancing peptide
( or whatever
they actually were )
scene .
not to ruin the invaluable plot
that drives this movie ,
but the main character goes to a wedding ,
where she sees all different type of personality `` driven '' by their peptide* ,
and then the film cut to the dance floor ,
where we are spliced between person dancing ,
sometimes surrounded by cg peptide 
and a fully cg scene 
filled with dancing peptide .
the film 
at that point 
was trying to tell us
how we are `` addicted to emotion 
''
so we are treated to the full song of that smash hit 
`` addicted to love .
`` this scene was redeeming ,
because anyone
who could go through that scene ,
and still take this movie seriously ... well ,
you are the one
that need to `` open your eye . ''
