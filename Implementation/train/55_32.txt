this is another one of those movie
that could have been great .
the basic premise is good - immortal cat person
who kill to live 
etc .
- sort of a variation on the vampire concept.the thing
that makes it all fall apart
is the total recklessness of the main character .
even sociopath know
that you need to keep a low profile
if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the unibomber ,
and that was because a family member figured it out.by contrast 
the kid
( and to a lesser extent 
the mom )
behave as though they are untouchable .
the kid kills
without a thought
for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness .
how these person managed to stay alive
and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable ,
let alone decade or centuries.it is really a shame - this could have been so much more
if it had been written plausibly 
i.e. ,
giving the main character the level of common sense
they would have needed to get by for so long.other than that 
not a bad showing .
i loved the bit at the end
where every cat in town converge on the house - every time i put out food on the porch
and see our cat suddenly rush in from wherever
they were before ,
i think of that scene .
