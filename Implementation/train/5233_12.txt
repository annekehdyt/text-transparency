i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york
and was horrified by the graphic 
sado-masochistic 
child pornography
that i witnessed .
the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scene - and ,
not one is in the least bit erotic - sick is the more the feeling .
the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various level
of why these character are like this .
see it
if you can stomach
it - i still have flashback .
