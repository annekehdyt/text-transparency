why am i so convinced
there is actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere ?
i saw the film again this year
as i am teaching the novel
and find the change in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed .
they kill him off in the film
but the whole point is that he is haunted by the event at eel marsh house for many year
but does remarry and eventually put the event behind him .
mr. bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel 
the scene in the film
where kipps sets fire to the office
is plain daft ,
and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy
but pointless - kipps is haunted by the woman
seeking revenge 
not the child .
i am sure
i have seen a film
which is better
and closer to the novel and actually scarier .
have i just imagined this ?
