to me 
this review may contain spoiler ,
but i like watching movie with no idea
of what is going to happen ,
so therefore i think
many of the other review here of this movie contain spoiler ! i just watched this movie again ,
and i must reiterate
that it has the best ending to any movie .
ever .
ever .
ever .
the real translation 
'the beating of the butterfly 's wing ' 
is oddly not used as the translated title .
i suppose
they thought
most american would not know what chaos theory is ( except for those
who saw or read `` jurassic park '' ) .
the movie is based on chaos theory ,
and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated event ,
which all lead back to one event .
the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect ,
as we follow the chain of chaos
as it intertwines between several character
( about 20 ? ) .
in a way 
the ending seems inevitable despite this ,
but
if you think about it ,
it is a perfect ending .
think to yourself ,
`` what else needed to be said '' ?
it is at the same time a very ave ending .
too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one ,
but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .
