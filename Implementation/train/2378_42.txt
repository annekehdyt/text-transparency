you have seen begotten.and begotten seems eathtakingly bizarre till
you have seen the work of c. frederic hobbs .
race fan 
there is nothing in all the world of film like the work of c. frederic hobbs.alabama 's ghost comes as close as any of his film
to having a coherent plot ,
and it only involves hippie 
rock concert 
voodoo 
ghost 
vampire 
robot 
magician 
corrupt multinational corporation 
elephant and mystery gas .
and the fabulous woodmobile 
cruising the sunset district in san francisco 
of course.what is really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money
to make alabama 's ghost .
there is set 
lighting 
hundred of extra 
costume 
lot and lot of effect .
somehow
that makes alabama 's ghost so wrong .
you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby ,
and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis
that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover card .
but alabama 's ghost was made with an actual budget ,
and that is evil .
i mean 
i have got a script about a tribe of cannibal living in thunder bay 
ontario ,
building a secret temple in the wood out of twizzler ,
and nobody 's beating down my door waving a checkbook -
how did this guy get the fund for four of the flakiest movie ever made ?
