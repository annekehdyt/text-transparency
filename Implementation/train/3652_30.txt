this was the best muppet movie i have seen ever !
i happen to know
that miss piggy 's fantasy of meeting as infant was the cause of muppet baby .
the song will remain in my head forever .
only saying so
because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head .
sorry 
a little off the topic there .
but anyway what i like is animal after the credit saying
`` bye bye !
bye bye !
bye bye !
bye bye !
bye bye !
hasta luego ! ''
that made me laugh so hard .
my absolute favorite is the play at the end .
i was surprised
that the sesame street character popped in at the wedding .
i am
just glad this movie was very entertaining .
i borrowed it from the liary ,
and now i have bought it
because i can not keep the liary 's copy forever .
in conclusion 
i proclaim this is the best movie
i have ever seen !
in my case 
it is even better than austin power in goldmember ,
which was my favorite movie !
