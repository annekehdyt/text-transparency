there is a level of high expectation
when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast
headed by cary grant 
jayne mansfield 
ray walston and werner klemperer .
those expectation are buoyed further
when the film is directed by stanley donen ,
whose comic touch was so evident in 
among other 
damn yankee ! 
bedazzled and charade .
for the first five minute 
or so 
it seems
that those expectation might be met and then .
nothing .
what is supposed to be a light comedy 
plunges into leaden 
heavy handed melodrama 
with nary a chuckle
to be had.relative newcomer suzy parker
has often been criticized for her performance 
or lack of one 
in this film ,
but in a movie
in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden ,
attacking parker seems unfair .
not even as ight a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the fortune of this meandering 
dreary and wholly pointless script ,
which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer 's interest
and patience down with it.the rest of the cast 
especially ray walston ,
keep trying to eath some life into the proceedings ,
but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation .
the desperate 
inane effort
to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film 's final moment
only serves to add insult to injury.this film
is nothing but a major disappointment on all level .
