a masterpiece.thus it is 
possibly 
not for everyone.the camera work 
acting ,
directing and everything else is unique 
original 
superb in every way - and very different from the trash
we are sadly
used to getting.summer phoenix creates a deep 
believable and intriguing esther kahn .
as everything else in this film ,
her acting is unique -
it is completely her own -
neither `` british '' nor `` american '' nor anything else
i have ever seen .
there is something mesmerizing about it.the lengthy 
unoken ,
natural shot are wonderful ,
reminding us
that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted way of shooting and editing .
