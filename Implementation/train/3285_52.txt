what the hell is this ?
`` kooky drama '' ?
`` lawyer in loony tune land '' ?
the world 's thinnest 
most duck-faced actress
( even more duck-faced and anorexic than michelle pfeiffer )
overacts her bony butt off ,
making cretinous grimace
that would shame bug bunny 
in one of the most animated non-animated tv series ever .
this is also the most annoying one-hour-format tv show ever ,
hence the worst.all the man act like pansy ,
and i for one refuse to believe
that even hip big-city shyster are all as delta-male-like as this sorry
( short ) bunch .
wuss peter macnicol manages to be even more irritating than calista flockofduck with his fake hollywood `` shshshs '' speech impedimant :
it is the sort of pseudo-inability to pronounce the letter `` s ''
by turning it into a moronic `` sh ''
that the like of jon shtewart and christian shlater also practice with zeal .
watching macnicol talk ,
i always wonder
how come his jaw does not dislocate ... human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the `` sh '' sound more than three time per second .
he is a medical wonder.this
badly conceived
and written legal-drama/comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s pc .
it has political correctness written with huge 
neon letter .
is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyer
being full of ideal 
high principle 
and moral fiber ?
laughable ,
but that is the way
defense lawyer have been portrayed in hollywood since its inception .
after all 
what is more noble than defending a murderer 
a rapist 
or a thief ?
when a tv series as retarded as `` ally mcbeak '' starts preaching to america about how it should run the country ,
then it must be time for paris hilton to become president .
`` ally mcquack '' is both a product of recent and large-scale western dumbing-down and a perpetrator of it.those supposed touch of `` eccentricity '' 
like the unbelievably annoying musical number 
are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny .
this is no monty python .
whatever `` new '' the talent-free maker of this garbage were aiming for ,
they failed with honour .
`` ally mcbeak '' is a highly commercialized tv venture
aimed at indiscriminating yuppie 
bored housewife 
and bipolar lawyer .
it is yet another dull `` objection overruled sustained your honour may i call the witness '' legalistic baloney
that the american audience seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason ...
