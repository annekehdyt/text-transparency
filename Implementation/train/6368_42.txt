the story idea
behind the lost missile is not bad at all ,
but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well
as poor special effect sink this film to the sub-par level.the film
begins with a missile heading towards the earth .
in a panic
because it is about to strike the earth 
the soviet manage to deflect the object .
this is not necessarily good 
however ,
as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail
that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet .
in other word 
with each pass it makes 
a swath of death follows
-- one
that could potentially kill us all ! !
so 
it is up to the good scientist of the us
( led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia )
to formulate and plan
to save us
-- and especially save new york
that is in its immediate flight path !
unfortunately 
they are not able to save ottawa
( i have never been there ,
so i can not say
whether or not this is a big loss )
but thank to good old american know-how 
they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction ! !
so ,
as you can see ,
the story idea is not bad and rather original .
but 
so many old clip of fighter plane and guy manning radar scope gets a bit old
and it seemed like padding .
overall 
a decent but hardly inspired film
that extreme fan of the genre may like
-- all other ,
see it at your own risk .
