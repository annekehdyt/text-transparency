this is absolutely the dumbest movie i have ever seen .
what a waste of a splendid cast .
that is jame cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy .
i could go on and on ,
but i would obviously be spending more time on this review
than anybody ever did on the script .
the only thing this movie is about is us vs. them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human
being 's tolerance .
this is one of the 10 worst movie i
have ever seen
-- and i love jame garner .
