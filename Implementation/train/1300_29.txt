actress ruth roman 's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troop arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump-started this all-star warner bros. salute to patriotism and song .
many celeity make guest appearance
while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal
( ron hagerthy ,
who looks like he should be delivering newspaper from his bicycle ) .
seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking
he is off to battle
when actually he is part of a airplane carrier crew 
flying to and from honolulu
( you would think
she had be happy
he was staying out of harm 's way ,
but instead she acts just like most childish female in 1950s movie ) .
doris day is around for the first thirty minute or so ,
and her distinct laugh and plucky song number are most pleasant .
roman is also here ,
looking glamorous ,
while jame cagney poke fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sing in his handsome baritone .
jane wyman sing 
too 
in a hospital bedside reprise
following doris day 's lead ,
causing one to wonder ,
`` did they run out of set ? ''
for undemanding viewer 
an interesting flashback to another time and place .
still 
the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspect render `` starlift '' strictly a second-biller .
