i went into this movie with high hope .
normally 
i am not too picky about my movie
and creature movie are *always* fun to watch ,
or so i thought .
i will list the good part of this movie :
-the creature effect .
all of the creature were well-done ,
their movement were realistic ,
and they fit into the other imagery well .
to be honest ,
the creature effect were the only reason
i gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. now 
the bad thing :
-the acting .
good lord 
i have seen bad acting ,
but this movie takes the cake .
not a single one of the character is even *close* to believable .
it is like the director sent out a casting call
and picked all the worst try-out from it .
i tried very hard not to giggle too loud ,
cause i did not wan na upset anyone else in the theatre ,
but the acting really was that bad .
-the storyline :
the entire story is full of plot hole from beginning to finish .
you can pick at least 5 plot hole out of any
given 30 minute of film .
the plot hole 
of course 
are complimentary with the cheese .
this is probably one of the most clich\u00e9d 
not thought-out ,
and outright dumbest story i have ever seen put on screen
since i had the grave misfortune
of sitting up one night
and watching parasite on the scifi channel .
-the dialogue :
this is a world
where everyone says
the cheesiest and most clich\u00e9d thing
they possibly can ,
at every chance they possibly can .
in this world 
it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movie .
it is the world of cheese and clich\u00e9 .
-the special effect .
while the creature effect were downright awesome ,
the special effect fail miserably .
yes 
they are better
than those seen in other movie ,
but a lot of it is in the presentation .
and this movie has no presentation whatsoever .
it looks kinda like the special effect
used on the power ranger tv show ,
to be honest .
to sum up :
dragon war is worth neither your time nor your money .
the concept is good ,
but it is trapped in the bad
directing 
acting 
dialogue 
and cheesiness of the film .
wait til the next big monster movie comes out .
it is got ta be better than this ,
cause dragon war is absolutely horrible .
