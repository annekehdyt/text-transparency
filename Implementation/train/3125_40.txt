the dentist was made on the time
when almost every profession had it
is psycho .
we had mad police officer 
ambulance man 
secretery 's and that was just for starter .
the dentist came suprisingly late
because going to dentist is usually everyman 's nightmare.the plot is twisted .
super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great `` white house '' ,
he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist .
dark cloud are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty ir guy
( terminator 's earl boen ) ,
dirty pool cleaner `` cleaning '' his wife
and suddenly everyone 's tooth seems to have gone through dark filter .
he goes nutso
and starts to take care of person tooth in the nasty way .
and you do not want to come to his path.crew were professional .
producer/director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movie like re-animator and from beyond .
he directed the sequel to re-animator and his firt movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter 's they live .
film 's producer pierre david is known from movie like scanner .
cast was great .
corbin bernsen really suprised me .
i knew him from la law and major league ,
but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist .
he was actually great in his role
and he was kind of sad person .
linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife .
micahel stadvec did not have much line 's ,
but after i saw him with lady of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession .
ken foree
( dawn of the dead 
from beyond )
was nice sight as cop on the case .
virginya keehne was the innocent teen
who is about to be next client to feinstone.final warning :
if you are like me
and have problem with dentist 's then
maybe you should skip this one .
but if you want to try
than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lot nasty drilling .
