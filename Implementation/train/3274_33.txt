an okay film 
with a fine leading lady 
but a terrible leading man .
stephan jenkin ,
who plays the husband ,
is a truly bad actor .
joyce hyser 
on the other hand 
is the movie 's saving grace .
she is the best actor of the bunch.note* the first comment 
by the fellow
who heaped praise
upon the movie
( and ,
according to his imdb.com account ,
has only written one review
-- and guess for what movie ? )
is obviously a plant .
while the movie is nicely shot ,
it is by no mean subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic description the reviewer used .
`` art of revenge '' is a fair movie ,
but it is a big tease .
it offers up all manner of sexual situation
but never goes through with it .
like watching a skin flick on cinemax ,
but with all the `` naughty bit '' edited out.the film 
as a whole 
is a bit unfocused and the ending ,
and much of the third act 
is really a big mess .
there is a twist ending ,
of course ,
since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.a 4/10 .
