this film had such promise ! !
what a great idea 
an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory ,
only to lose it is speed due to bad dialoge 
poor editing and a half-written story .
the character in the beginning were interesting ,
only to lose steam half way
through to become one dimensional person sputtering out tired one-liners.maybe
if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge
it would have been a great movie 
instead of a almost afterthought effort .
