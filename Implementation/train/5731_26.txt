another chapter in the ongoing question ,
whatever happened to mel brooks 's sense of humor ?
it starts out nicely enough 
with mel as trump-like mogul goddard bolt
( `` you can call me god '' ) ,
who accepts a bet
that he can not live on the street for 30 day .
but the moment the movie hits the street ,
it turns into a pathos-laden mess 
with occasional `` funny '' bit interjected
( mel sees a black kid eak-dancing for money
and try to do a vaudeville buck-and-wing 
yuk 
yuk ) .
leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted .
the worst part is this movie 's musical number ,
in which brooks and warren do a silent dance to cole porter 's `` easy to love . ''
brooks 's musical parody are usually the highlight of his movie ;
here he plays the whole thing straight 
like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on `` the carol burnett show ''
( on which rudy deluca 
this film 's co-writer 
began his career ) .
go rent charlie chaplin 's the kid ,
which covered the same ground 70 year
before and did a lot
