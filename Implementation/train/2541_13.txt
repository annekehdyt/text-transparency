that is my bush is a live action project
made by south park creator trey parker and matt stone.the show was cancelled after one season ,
not because of bad review
( it actually got good review ) ,
but because it was very expensive.that is my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom.it is also a political satire.now ,
this is nowhere near as good as south park ,
but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom
and also a pretty good political satire.the guy
who plays in that is my bush looks a lot like him !
if you can find the show ,
check
it out.there are plenty of laugh
to be had ! 9/10
