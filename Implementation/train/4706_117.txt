from the q and a before and after 
this is what i could gather :
some irish guy wants to make a movie .
nothing in particular ,
just any movie .
so 
one night at a party 
he hears some ex-roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n ' roll lore ;
the one about how gram parson ' corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie
so he could honor parson ' wish
that he be cremated out in joshuatree .
wow ! what a great idea for a movie !
rock n ' roll
( well 
country ) ,
grave robbing 
escape 
friendship 
the 70 's !
i guess
we could get johnny knoxville from `` jackass '' ,
cause it is kind of a prank 
right ,
and knoxville wants to do `` a movie '' too .
why he must have thought
he had the next `` snatch '' on his hand !
but this story 's not really that exciting ... we need something for knoxville
to struggle against.like a psychotic girlfirend after his money !
but parson ' was married at the time .
that is o.k. 
no one knows that .
besides we could get christina applegate .
but what
if the audience does not like the idea of stealing a corpse.well ,
we will get his dad to join the chase ,
but give permission in the end .
but parson ' dad killed himself
when he was 10 ,
in fact his orphan status 
and tragic childhood 
are key part of the parson mythology .
mythology ?
we are making `` a movie ! ''
this is creative problem solving.it is an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject .
applegate 's presence is doubling jarring .
first her invented character is a beverly hill bitch
before her time -she might
as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand ,
and secondly 
what kind of man would parson be
if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy ?
fact are not just distorted or left out ,
but reversed .
they could have easily found the villain
they wanted in parson stepfather ,
who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state
where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance.and the music 
oh 
the music i love .
the music is hacked up
( the idge of a song here ,
the chorus there ) ,
forced to the background 
and in the end 
horribly covered by the hippest new indie band 
starsailor .
my girlfriend asked the unnecessary 
but irresistable question after the movie
-- was anyone up there ,
the writer 
the producer 
the director 
actually a gram parson 's fan ?
well 
no .
he had never actually heard of gram parson ,
but of course 
blah blah blah 
i learned to love it ,
and here is some factoid i read in a bio online .
another guy vouched for parson ' coolness
by saying
he and keith richard tripped on acid together
and wrote `` wild horse '' together 
a mixed up bunch of fact as off-base as the movie .
another person asked 
was not it morally questionable to rewrite history
when most person would only know about it from this film ?
well 
he had the real roadie 's permission
( he was even set )
and the parson estate gave permission ,
and all these other person
who got paycheck
said
it was great.but what i really wondered was ,
and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parson geek ,
was ,
if the movie 's so cheaply made
( a million ) ,
had they not considered the original gram parson fanbase as an audience ?
the director and writer seemed to think
he was a nothing figure with no fanbase ,
though i doubt any mojo magazine reading ,
country-rock 70 's music fan would agree .
but a bunch of brit made it i guess ,
and they just did not care about cosmic american music ,
or even knew it existed .
this is not just not a truthful parson flick ,
it is not even in the right spirit -it does not even fit the legend .
at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his song .
and plenty of person would love to be told.i
should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kid 
just off the slope 
and into johnny knoxville .
but if you are a parson fan ignore the title ,
it is just a movie for jackass fan .
