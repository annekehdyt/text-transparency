sunny 
a cocktail waitress in the d.c. area 
is a bit dim ,
to put in mildly .
she drives an old clunker
and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple .
however 
she saves the life of a prominent arab ,
by taking a bullet in the behind
that was meant for the official .
she charms the national press with her zany remark and her sweet look .
sniffing an opportunity 
presidential aide get her installed in the protocol department for the u.s. government .
even then 
she messes thing up at time ,
but she tries hard and learns a lot .
she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official .
but 
is there another sinister plot in the making ,
involving an arab man
who wishes to take another wife ?
a blonde one ?
lol 
lol 
lol .
this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb `` as a fox '' ,
as they say .
sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u.s. government very 
very well .
she even has important thing to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surrounding .
perhaps 
the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work ,
but for those
who like to laugh ,
rent this today .
