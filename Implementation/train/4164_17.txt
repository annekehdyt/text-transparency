i will admit .
i think
uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet
and have made it a mission
to see every movie
she has been in
( unfortunately that includes the horrible film batman and robin 
the avenger )
and this one.this has to rank
as the worst movie i have ever seen .
( yes it ranks even lower than the avenger ) .
everyone looks lost in it
and it is incoherent beyond belief .
even if you think
uma is a goddess like i do ,
please please do not subject yourself to this movie .
you will hate yourself the following morning for it .
