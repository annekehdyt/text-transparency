absence of a good plot ,
absence of decent acting 
absence of good cinematography 
absence of decent looking special effect ...
need i go on ?
review may contain spoiler .
the actor appear to be reading their line ,
and not very well at that .
most of the `` actor '' were acting
like they were in a second grade play .
the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second grader ...
it is not really all that convoluted ... it is just so simple and dumb ,
that a person thinks
they must be missing something
so they think
it is convoluted .
nope it is not ,
it is exactly as simple
as you think
it is .
i understood the `` film '' ,
that is how i know that it stunk !
most of the film just had person sitting around talking
( reading their line ) ,
trying to look sinister .
the narrator was annoying .
the `` special effect '' were laughable .
i love low budget movie .
i also like carolyn munro 
tom savini 
jack scarry 
and michael berrymore ... just not in this movie ...
you can tell
they were not getting paid ,
or were not getting paid much ,
because neither their heart nor
their talent were in it .
i love tony todd ... however ,
he was only adequate in this movie .
in fact 
tony todd 's performance is the only reason
i gave it 3 star instead of 1 ...
and tony was only in it for a whole two minute
( seriously ) !
i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment .
if i had gone to the theater ,
and paid more than a dollar
to see this `` film '' i would have been p.o .
'd and demanded my money back .
hopefully the person
who made this
will do better next time .
