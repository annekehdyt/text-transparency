i do not know how to describe this movie .
it is definitely one of the weirdest movie
i have seen in a long time .
it is very unsettling at time
but also boring in other place .
the scene of dental torture are very elaborate
and may attract anyone
who 's into gore and splatter .
i found myself holding my tooth during some of the aforementioned scene .
the clever thing
about the movie is
that it plays with our fear
and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling.the humor of the film
is somehow hidden
and may not be recognized by everyone .
but if you are a fan of weird and strange entertainment and tooth getting drilled to dust this
is just the film
you were looking for.if
you read the comment
and feel somehow
attracted by this kind of entertainment ,
give it a try ! my rating :
4/10
( maybe a little too weird for my taste )
