if you were ought up on a diet of gameshow you
will understand
that you gradually need a bigger and better fix .
well 
in the world of the running man 
your need will be sated .
for in this game show 
prisoner compete for freedom ,
and the ultimate prize - their very lives.i loved this film .
it was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe
that we watch on a daily basis .
it is not one of schwarzenegger 's best performance ,
but on the whole it is a very good film .
the underlying idea
that television corporation will one day be the `` real '' ruler of the planet is very believable ,
and is very well portrayed in this film .
of course there are the usual arnie one-liner ,
my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone 
the gameshow host asks `` any last word ? ''
arnie says :
`` yeah 
i will be back '' but the host quips `` only in a re-run ''
and presses the eject button .
i give this film a 10 for sheer originality .
i must have watched it 30 or more time .
the only film apart from the die hard series
that i watched this often !
! in short 
do not for a minute think
that you own the t.v .
- it owns you ... ..
