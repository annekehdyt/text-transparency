why would a person go back to a person ,
who kicks them in the tooth ,
not once 
not twice ,
but over and over again.this film teach us
that in order to find love we must accept abuse
( not just forgive it ,
but fully accept it ) .
gosh !
no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten year .
i obviously was not emacing my inner masochist.as bucatinsky 's writing debut ,
there are many wonderful aspect to this film ; however ,
in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom ,
more character development would have been helpful .
we are never acquainted with eli 's masochism 
in fact 
we are led to believe
that he is not a masochist ,
although tom 's psycho-emotional sadism is highly evident .
