i do not know what movie some of these other person watched ,
but they must have seen a different `` joseph smith :
prophet of the restoration '' than the one i saw.i think
the movie was both well-done and inspiring .
i think
it is definitely worth watching .
it is apparent from the outset
that a lot of care went into the making of this film .
the background scenery is beautiful.i think
the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith
both as a man and as a prophet .
joseph 's spiritual experience are portrayed with taste and reverence.i
would definitely recommend watching this movie .
