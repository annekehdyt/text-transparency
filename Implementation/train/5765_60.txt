**** = a masterpiece to be recorded in the book

worth-while 
very entertaining piece**1/2 = a good movie ,
but there are some uneven element or noticeable flaws** = may still be considered good in area ,
but this work has either serious issue
or is restrained by inevitable element deemed inescapable
( e.g. 
genre )
*1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing

considerable sexuality 
and language )
i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celeation of brad pitt 's face ,
but was happily surprised and disappointed .
this really is more of a drama ,
and very grim at that ... i remember
some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs.pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent .
who started out as a hopeless yet harmless `` white trash ''
husband became realized as a violent 
disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind .
during some of the latter stage in the film 
i found it hard to keep watching him -
he was unpredictable and scary .
this proves very good writing
and acting.the whole movie is filled with bizarre 
sensational scene
that made me hold my eath not fewer than once ,
and i do not mean action scene .
i mean dialogue scene
so illiantly crafted i
actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing .
it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching
as they gnawed each other to death .
again 
i am very impressed with the screenwriter
( s ) ;
whoever
they are did the impossible :
mixed oil and water.i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis 's performance .
it is so rare for this talented young actress
to make an appearance these day
that
when she does it
is such a joy .
some of her moment in this film ought me to tear .
i mean that .
the emotion this girl can arouse in your head are incredible ,
and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions.i almost feel
like i am cheating the quality craftsmanship the film maker have displayed
by only giving `` kalifornia '' a *** rating .
but the dark feeling
that it stirs
are too potent and depressing
to raise it .
i do believe
that everyone should see this movie though .
i truly do .
