this is an absolutely charming film 
one of my favourite romantic comedy .
it is extremely humorous
and the cast is wonderful .
though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work
he shows in this film
that he is by no
mean restricted to play only classical theatre .
he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor ,
who tries to avoid woman and their traitorous way 
to the lovesick puppy
that falls for lady x
played by merle oberon effortlessly .
the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting .
ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well .
i highly recommend it .
