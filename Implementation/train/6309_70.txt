when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movie 
the first thing i think
of are '80 slasher flick .
really bad slasher flick .
the formulaic type of film ,
where all a script needed was 2 part blood and several part nudity
to get made.flash forward to the late '90s/early '00s .
the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996 's `` scream '' .
like in the '80 
these film were formulaic ,
masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as `` hip 
tongue-in-cheek parody '' of the original slasher flick .
of this recent blend of `` hip parody '' neo-slasher flick 
the only one worth seeing is the low-budget 
direct-to-video `` cut '' .like most of the other `` new '' slasher flick ,
`` cut '' rely on the production of a slasher flick 
in this case a fictional 1985 film `` hot blooded '' ,
to make its commentary on the genre .
`` hot blooded '' never finished production ,
because of killing by someone
wearing the mask of the film 's killer 
scarman 
a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark 
pupil-less eye .
now 
12 year later 
a group of film student ,
whose professor was involved in the production ,
have decided to go into the vault ,
tap the original surviving actress ,
and finish the film .
but every time the film is screened
or a scene
is shot 
`` scarman '' return and someone dy .
to quote the tagline 
will they finish the film
before it finishes them ? this all sounds really bad ,
and to a degree it is ( really 
is there such a thing as a good slasher flick ? ) .
there is no character development
( the `` new '' director is revealed to be the daughter of `` hot blooded '' 's original director ,
whose life was apparently ruined
after the production was cancelled ;
this would 've been a perfect detail
to be worked into the plot ,
yet it is never mentioned again )
and 
like in all other slasher flick 
there are just too many body to care about .
the actor are not great 
even by direct-to-video standard ,
but most are having fun with their character
( and for those
who are not ,
it is inadvertent character acting ,
since none of their character in the film wanted to work on `` hot blooded '' ) ,
particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman .
`` cut '' 's climax has no big `` who dunnit '' unmasking of the killer like in the `` scream '' film .
it does not have the gimmick killing of the `` urban legend '' film .
what it does have is an original and interesting concept
that is diluted by a `` this way
we can write a sequel
if it sells well ''
ending .
but that is par for the course.by any sensible viewing standard ,
this is a horrible movie
that should be avoided ,
but this `` quality '' is what makes it true to its root in the slasher genre ,
and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flick .
