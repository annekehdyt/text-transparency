ok - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal change therin -
then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kid making socially relevant horror flick in the suburban 80 's .
more than any movie i has ever seen 
the film deal with burdening sexuality and ego in a way
that is completely human ,
never dull 
and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth
that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world
where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion .
mini-mogul darren stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgiving as the patriarch of strict kid 's world .
what he finds in himself and other is not always pretty -
but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age .
what does change mean without reflection .
i love this movie .
