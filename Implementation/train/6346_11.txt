pointless boring film with charismatic mercurio completely wasted .
released for a minute on a thursday in maybe one local cinema
and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four other back of beyond is a project seemingly
created by a producer
looking for a fee .
local actor like john polson and terry serio deserve better
( well polson has morphed into a director of lame thriller like swimfan and hide and seek )
and terry serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug role .
but paul mercurio should have become one of australia 's greatest export on screen .
role like this are major disappointment
and film like this are just a waste of talent and time .
