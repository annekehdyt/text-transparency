if you look at corey large 's information here on imdb ,
apparently there is a movie
called `` reload '' in production
( as of june '08 )
in which he is playing a character
named sebastian cole.first of all ,
how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second ,
did not sebastian get killed at the end of `` loaded '' ?
i watched this in the wee hour of the morning
when i was battling insomnia ,
and so i was drifting in and out
while it was on .
i am sure i missed some plot point 
but overall ,
it seemed really weak .
large 's performance was ( for me )
one of the stronger part of the film .
i am also a bit surprised at all the person
commenting on the beautiful girl ,
since i thought
the actress playing brooke was pretty 
but not exceptional .
