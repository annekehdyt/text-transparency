i can only assume
that the other reviewer of this `` film '' are stockholder in the production company ,
as this was quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in the last five year .
from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason ,
it was clear that the actor in this film would kill to be considered `` b-level . ''
both my wife and i were in a great mood
before starting this film ,
and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie .
we knew
we had not rented citizen kane ,
and we were not expecting to see the most amazing movie ever .
however 
after 40 minute of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i have ever seen ,
we shut it off instead of wasting another minute of our lives.if a `` comedy '' with no laugh ,
terrible acting 
thin plot and annoying character are your thing ,
then this film is for you .
honestly 
troll 2 is better
-- at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene.i can not justify writing a longer review of this picture
because i have already wasted almost an hour trying
to find one joke .
