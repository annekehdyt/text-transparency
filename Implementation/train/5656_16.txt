this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha ,
and it is for die-hard boris karloff fan
( like moi ) only .
it is not a horror flick ,
but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist
agreeing
to kill a wealthy woman 's husband
in order to gain the fortune
needed
to continue with his work .
but once the dying victim change his will and leaves his spouse nothing ,
all hell eak loose.it is appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type ,
and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious
( especially from the leading lady mona goya
who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed wife )
.but proceed with much caution .
