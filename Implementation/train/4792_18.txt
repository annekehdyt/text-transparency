within the first few minute of this dutch thriller ,
we learn
that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer
who sleeps san underwear 
fantasizes about murdering his roommate ,
try to steal a magazine from a news stand ,
and lust after a studly young man he meets at the train station .
and he is the hero of this nonsensical movie
that is all dressed up
( except for krabbe in at least one scene too many )
but has nowhere to go .
the basic plot is very simple
but is dragged out to nearly two hour
before reaching a pointless conclusion .
verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resort to scene of wild hallucination 
overt symbolism 
and gratuitous gore
when he runs out of idea .
