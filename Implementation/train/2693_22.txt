absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on.this was a wrong choice for all these great star
to waste their reputation on .
boring !
boring !
boring !
each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way .
no acting talent shown -just reading a part .
alec can play realistic character normally ,
gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part 
annette need advise on how to pick the movie
she chooses to play in as do all these big star
who have left me disappointed at the way
they have all allowed their talent
to be smothered in a feature
that leaves much to be desired in entertainment .
`` running with scissors '' leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film
that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion .
there was not one moment
when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen .
maybe it was the director 's fault
-- --
whatever .
