i did not expect much from this tv movie .
you have to set the bar lower
than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr. still ,
it managed to disappoint ,
failing even to be a good-bad film.every scene
was by rote ,
as if someone had cut and pasted scene from a dozen movie and tv show dealing with big business conspiracy into the script ,
leaned back
and said ,
`` my work is done '' .
it is all cliche 
all predictable 
and 
even worse 
the actor are forced to look like they are taking it seriously ,
( even when the plot development are laughable )
.do yourself a favor .
watch `` the x-file '' if you are in the mood for paranoia .
they handle it better .
also 
let anyone know
that
sitting through `` fatal error ''
is just that .
