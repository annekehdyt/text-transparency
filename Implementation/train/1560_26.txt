this film plays really well with an audience .
especially once the chase begins .
plus 
trevor howard with his sensible 
smart charm and jean simmon with her innocent demeanor and piercing eye are terrific together.the film starts as a psychological drama
but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two lead head for the border .
some may think
the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential
because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmon character
by getting her out of the oppressive household ,
plus
it helps ing out the real killer -
who is suddenly put into such a position
that they have to finish the job .
the killer rightly believed
that once the simmon character was arrested
she would be put away .
and it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence
pointing her way -
there is no way
she would have gotten out of the murder charge .
the chase
that ensues helps ing out the truth.this
is an entertaining film .
seek it out
if you can find it .
