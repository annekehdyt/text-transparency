i thought
this was one of the most depressing holiday movie i have ever seen
-- the other being the christmas wife and jack frost .
all three movie are about death .
if you like being thoroughly depressed ,
then by all mean watch this film or any of the other .
in this film 
the acting is good and some of the scenery
( apart
when person are dying )
is lovely .
but 
i am worried
that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film
and do themselves in !
despite a `` happily ever after '' ending ,
the major portion of this film is one awful disaster
following another .
and 
for some crazy reason 
i do not want to be depressed
when i watch a christmas movie
( i know this sounds crazy folk
-- after all 
is not bawling your eye out and feeling miserable
what the holiday are all about anyway ?
)
.for a more uplifting viewing experience ,
try the forgotten house
without a christmas tree ,
george c. scott 's christmas carol or a christmas story instead
-- unless of course you like being miserable .
