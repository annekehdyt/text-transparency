i have seen about four other japanese horror film
and they were not too impressive .
however 
i could sense
that there was a sensible script
guiding the way.not here 
no way .
this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murder
that have been happening .
when he finds a suspect to question ,
the suspect freaks out
because they keep seeing a ghost .
then 
the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason
that is never explained
and takes up more than half of the movie.bad enough ?
oh no .
the film keeps switching perspective to different character
who do not have much to do with the story .
i have seen this before in other movie
where it shows a different perspective .
not the case here.also 
whatever is happening on screen
that is actually tolerable quickly ends .
for example 
there a few scene with a slight instrumental score
that builds up and ...
then it just cuts to another scene .
i am aware
that this can be a dramatic effect .
that is definitely not the intention here .
it is just bad editing.finally ,
there is the `` ghost ''
who just screams in a way
that is not scary or unintentionally funny .
it is annoying
and it happens a lot throughout the movie.all of the scare have been done before in better way
so you can see them all coming .
then after one of them ,
the movie is over .
at that point 
a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense
we all felt
that we had wasted our time .
someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued .
it was better than the whole film .
simply put 
avoid .
