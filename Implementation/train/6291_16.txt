why is it that any film about cleopatra 
the last phaoroh ings out the worst in movie making ?
whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all 
julius ceasar 
and his successor 
mark anthony 
never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antic of over sexed high school senior .
despite lavish set and costume ,
this movie is as bad as any italian `` sandal and toga '' extravaganza of the 50 's .
admittedly 
this kind of spectacular belong on the big screen ,
which is why `` gladiator '' went over well ,
but `` gladiator '' did not have all the romance
novel sex.miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor ,
but timothy dalton has talent to spare .
pity some of it did not wash off on the other .
