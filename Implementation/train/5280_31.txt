for some reason 
tv guide gave this two and a half star ,
plus faye dunaway is in it ,
so it definitely looked like something to see .
my 
oh 
my 
this may be the worst film i have ever seen .
ever .
from its horrid acting
( every time
the girl asks
the boy what is wrong with him ,
i shouted to the tv `` i can not act ! ''
when she asks what he needs ,
i yell `` i need acting lesson ! ''
to the unbelievably bad dialog
( `` give me back my organ !
`` )
.and the brian depalma wannabe ending 
too ,
it was all just beyond awful .
i wanted to like it .
dunaway is one of the best actor ever .
and the production value were pretty good.but wowzer ,
this had me laughing 
laughing ! ,
most of the time.do not even bother out of curiosity ,
that was my first mistake .
staying with it was definitely my second 
and third and fourth .
