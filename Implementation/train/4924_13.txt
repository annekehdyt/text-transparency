`` smithereen '' is the kind of worthless flick
which just hangs out among the cable channel
taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public liary .
a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman 
the film is fraught with bad acting 
bad sound ,
bad camera work ,
and poor quality in all aspect of the film .
many better film never make it to market
and why junk flick like this one do
and never seem to go away
is one of life 's great mystery .
