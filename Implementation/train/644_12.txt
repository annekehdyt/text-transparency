only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-file fail to generate any excitement
or does the episode contain anything
which is just totally boring to watch.a detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.the death are linked to the presence of a little girl
who was there
when the death took place.mulder has devised a theory
that a policeman
murdered by his colleague
has come back reincarnated as the little girl
and is exacting revenge.now for the bizarre bit.the little girl has no connection at all
and seems to just a random person
chosen as the reincarnation.i think
this was slightly lazy writing by the writer and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-file history !
