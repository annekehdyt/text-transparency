what a moving film .
i have a dear friend
who is in her sixty
and for the past 15 year has told me
that person do not see her anymore ,
and she longs for companionship .
being in my late 40s i am
beginning to see what she has been complaining about .
you are no longer youthful 
beautiful or touchable .
when may says
`` ... this lump of a body ... '' wow .
how our body change and how we are told
it is no longer beautiful .
i love
when she begins to change
what she wears ...
the colorful scarf ... no longer the frumpy wife.it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time .
sad in that may betrays her daughter 's trust ... beautiful
in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair ,
and chooses to move on
and finally have her own life .
i love the character 's daring to even initiate the love affair.mostly i love the movie
because finally it is a picture
that shows the intricate nature of relationship ,
be they familial or not .
we see paula 's vulnerability ,
yet she will have what she wants at all cost ...
( when she tells her mum
that she will have a baby for darren whether
he wants one or not after her mother asks
if darren even wants a child ) .
the movie hits the mark on the how relationship can change ,
and yet reveal
what has been there all along 
dormant .
may has stifled her own creativity
to raise a family .
a family
that she did not really want ,
but was `` something you just did
when she was young '' .
i love the scene
when darren calls her an old tart ,
and she smile and says
`` i was never called that before '' .
it was truly a gem of a movie.and daniel craig .
well 
i just love him .
i was pleasantly surprised .
not only is he pleasant on the eye ,
he is a real talent .
what a neat role .
he is much more than any 007
that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more role of this nature .
the scene
where he is pleasuring may and the look
he gives her
is sort of a look of wonder
that he has such control over this woman ,
and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her .
he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure .
a wonderful scene .
the contrast is the love scene with bruce .
bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure ...
two completely different men.ala ... i wonder
where is my darren ?
