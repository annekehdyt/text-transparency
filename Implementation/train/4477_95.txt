so angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation
to turn her into a real life daughter 
rather than the son
that she was born ,
and now hold a job
as - wait for it - a camp counselor !
how appropriate 
right ?
i know 
i love it .
anyway 
the first sequel to the sleepaway camp franchise obeys all the rule of horror sequel - more blood 
more imaginative killing
( which are not imaginative ,
but still more so than the original ) ,
more nudity 
a more elaborate plot ,
and generally worse than the original .
it is entertaining in the same way
as the original was ,
in that the character and wardrobe are so goofy
and so authentically 80 's
that you can not help getting a good laugh .
at one point 
a guy asks angela out ,
and she says
`` i will call you 
''
and then quickly walks away .
the guy says to himself ,
`` how is she gon na call me ?
i do not have a phone ! ''
and then he sniffs his armpit ,
wondering what turned her off
( it is the hair 
dude ! !
) .it is a well-known fact
that in 80s slasher movie 
the murdered teenager were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior ,
usually for being too promiscuous .
when i first started getting into horror movie
and saw the friday the 13th movie for the first time in the mid 90s ,
i did not realize this .
i learned it in a film class a year or two later
and was amazed
that their was some method to the madness .
i was pretty impressed ,
not only that the movie were passing on some kind of message 
albeit a morbid one ,
but that there was actually some thought put into it.but not in this movie !
at one point just before angela kill one of her victim ,
she says
`` let this be a lesson to you .
say no to drug ! ''
real subtle screen writing there 
guy .
then again 
the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie .
angela
( who 
by the way ,
went through all that therapy and those operation and all
that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person
and then changed her name from angela to 
umm 
angela ) ,
says at one point ,
`` i do not like being the wicked witch of the west ,
but i know what happens
when thing get out of control . ''
( person start getting killed ... by me !
ha !
) then later 
she demands
that one of the counselor 
mare 
make an apology ,
to which the girl reply ,
`` i would rather die ! ''
sorry 
mare ,
but you really walked into that one ... two year ago i was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie
( except the camp
that i taught at
had more than three kid to the 15 or 20 counselor
and it also had rule ,
which the one in the movie does not ) .
this made me notice
the myriad of discrepancy in the movie from what camp life is really like .
that is okay though ,
you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year old running around ,
although there were some 10 or 11 year old kid killed in this movie .
i had not seen that kind of thing much before .
definitely bad taste 
even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie ... .
