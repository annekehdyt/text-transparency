i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70 's crown international drive-in sexploitation comedy cheese on dvd .
it is a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely eezy'n'easy 70 's vibe to it .
it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendhip being more important in life than a cool set of wheel and a quick piece of tail .
sure 
it is essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic
-- the main teen goofus character bobby hamilton gets the girl 
the respect of his friend 
and a chance to show-up a local van-racing bully
--
but it is way too dopey and good-natured to hate .
stuart getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead ,
deborah white as the main object of getz 's affection is a definite cutie ,
connie lisa marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe ,
and sneering beefcake neanderthal stephan oliver
( a 60 's biker movie perennial )
is wonderfully hateful as the utish dugan hick .
a pre-stardom danny devito in particular is an absolute riot as getz 's cranky carwash owner boss andy 
a lovably can notankerous ne'er-do-well slob
who wears very ugly loud hawaiian shirt
and suffer from a severe gambling habit .
i especially love the scene
where two thug utally beat danny up
-- one holds his arm behind his back
while the other guy works over danny 's torso !
and sammy johns ' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week .
in short 
it is great groovy retro-70 's fun !
