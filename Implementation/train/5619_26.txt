as a collector of movie memorabilium 
i had to buy the movie poster for this film
which ,
now that i have finally seen it ,
has to be the best thing about it .
there is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man .
however 
there is nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man .
at first i thought
this movie was pure garbage
but then i realized
that it did have some quality
which made me laugh .
the character of dr. ted nelson has to be the most wishy-washy persona ever ought to the big screen .
his dialogue is so trite
it is unbelievable !
( `` it is incredible !
he seems to be getting stronger
as he melts !
) and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know
exactly how much time steve has left
before he melts completely
and exactly what their plan is to `` help '' him ?
if this movie was meant to scare its audience ,
i think
it missed its calling .
