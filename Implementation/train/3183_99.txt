in this swimming pool 
this pond 
there are water lily
and there are frog .
frog sit on water lily .
the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship .
marie
( pauline acquart )
is a water lily 
a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine
( adele haenel ) ,
a frog 
the captain of her team .
floraine 's teammate shun their leader
because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona
that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer 's mindset of conformity and discipline .
but floraine has a secret ;
the bombshell has a bombshell ,
which `` naissance de pieuvre '' reveal to the audience 
visually ,
before she confide in marie.floraine has never gone ,
as they say ,
all the way 
with a boy.at a party 
we see a double-image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make-up in a bathroom mirror .
`` lolita '' is a fata morgana .
marie gets to know floraine 's double
while her imitation eaks the water lily 's heart .
while the frog goes through the motion of catching fly for appearance 's sake ,
she gets chummy with the water lily
when no one 's looking .
in the film 's most startling scene 
the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand
in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation .
floraine wants boy to like her ,
but she does not like boy 
seemingly ,
but it is more important to the frog
that she is popular .
when the water lily finally kisses the frog ,
the frog remains a frog .
the frog can not transform into a water lily 
or a princess ,
because the water lily lost the frog 's respect .
after their lip unlock 
floraine tell marie 
`` see 
it is easy 
''
which is the frog 's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm
that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite-of-passage
without any string attached .
floraine 's beauty is a burden .
she carries the weight of meeting boy 's expectation .
florence use marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet.the other water lily 
the other frog 
marie 's best friend anne
( louise blachere )
and floraine 's frustrated boy-toy francois
( warren jacobs ) ,
just like any water lily and frog ,
have a parasitic relationship 
too .
while floraine use marie for love ,
francois use anne for sex .
but that is life ;
that is the treachery of growing up ,
in which even a friend will turn on a good friend
if the opportunity
to move up the food chain
present itself .
at a mcdonald 
the water lily chastises the other water lily
after bathing extensively in the frog 's afterglow .
physical beauty is a currency .
marie gets to call the shot
because anne ,
although far from being ugly ,
is overweight
and has an unflattering hairdo .
anne try to fight back
by using her east as ample retaliation
( the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comment on marie 's flat chest ) ,
but the tadpole
( marie thinks
she is better than anne 
better than a water lily )
point out
that her east are a byproduct of fat .
teenaged girl can be utal to each other.later 
in the final shot 
`` naissance de pieuvre '' suggests
that marie has a double 
too ,
and this symbiosis among water lily has the potential
to turn parasitic in the near-future ,
if it not already has .
teenaged girl can be utal to each other in a way
that no boy could match .
