this juvenile 
bland flick is strictly for teenager in old men ' body ,
desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage year .
how ?
by burning up gas and equating a fast 
reckless car
( or plane )
with freedom.the plot borrow heavily from mister roger ' neighborhood
( if it were run my an oil conglomerate )
and logan 's run
( if it were heavily sedated
and lacked a clear sense of style )
.starring lee major and burgess meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world
in which an all-powerful government does not want you to
( *ahem* )
drive your car and burn gas .
sort of the opposite of today 's enron-and-bush 
oil-grabbing 
suv-pushing government.this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable .
but wait ... there is more .
although the film is set in the future ,
we are not shown any sign of future technology 
beyond a return to bicycle 
golf cart and horse .
you will believe
that the future looks ... exactly like today .
same clothing 
same suburban house ,
same green lawns as today
and when the film was made .
there are no solar panel 
no windmill 
no concession to alternate energy.the acting is flat and flavorless .
even scene
which could have been gritty or moving 
buddy-flick 
honor 
romance 
horror ...
all fall flatter than a paper doll under a iefcase.continuity is lacking
-- the jet flown by burgess meredith 's character change color and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmaker insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again
and again.the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode.even die-hard car-film and sf fan should avoid this film like month-old roadkill ,
unless you enjoy heckling exxon executive
trying to make a movie as empty as the hero 's gas tank .
