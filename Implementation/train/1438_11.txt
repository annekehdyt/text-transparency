this is absolutely the worst movie i have seen all year.first ,
i will say
that the acting was very good ,
and by all of the cast.this was apparently meant to be very offbeat ,
and in that regard it succeeded .
by the same token 
the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe ,
who is a clueless 
talentless chronic liar ,
whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers.this was worse
than watching a car wreck .
