i notice
the dvd version seems to have missing scene or line between the posting of the frf and the launch .
they are to prove
they can win the right
to sit in the frf other
than the green team.another scene is like during their failure at the simulation 
kevin gets joaquin to clam down.i think
the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff.otherwise i
like to know
which dvd release has the missing stuff.the dvd i
have watched feel edited for television .
