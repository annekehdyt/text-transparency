i got this dvd from a friend ,
who got it from someone else
( and that probably keeps going on.. )
even the cover of the dvd looks cheap ,
as is the entire movie .
gunshot and fist fight with delayed sound effect ,
some of the worst actor i\u00b4ve seen in my life 
a very simple plot ,
it made me laugh \u00b4till my stomach hurt !
with very few financial resource 
i must admit
it looked pretty professional .
seen as a movie ,
it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flick nobody\u00b4s waiting for .
so :
if you\u00b4re tired and want a cheap laugh ,
see this movie .
if not ,
throw it out of the window .
