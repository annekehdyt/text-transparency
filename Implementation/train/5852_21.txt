this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movie :
bad porn movie
without the hardcore sex .
the plot in this one is not so bad
as these thing go ;
it involves a female lawyer
trying to prove her lover
is innocent of killing his wife .
the rest of the movie 
however 
leaves something to be desired .
bad acting 
bad direction 
bad looking woman ,
bad set 
bad cinematography 
bad sound and bad sex scene .
the filmmaker should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic .
they do not even have the common sense
to have gaiella hall naked or in a love scene .
how dumb is that ?
