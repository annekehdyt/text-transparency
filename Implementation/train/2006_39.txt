in celeation of earth day disney has released the film `` earth '' .
stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom ,
we are treated to some excellent footage of animal in their habitat
without feeling too bad about ourselves.the star of the show are a herd of elephant 
a family of polar bear and a whale and its calf .
the narrative begin at the north pole and proceed south
until we reach the tropic ,
all the while being introduced to denizen of the various climatic zone traversed.global warming
is mentioned in
while we view the wandering of polar bear ;
note is made of the shrinking sea ice island in more recent year .
we never see the bear catch any seal ,
but the father 's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution.the aerial shot of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shot i
ever saw ;
it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough
to reward the price of admission
to see them on the big screen.one of the disappointment i
felt
was that otherwise terrific shot of great white shark taking seal were filmed in slow motion .
never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animal ;
their incredible speed .
the idea
of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i
think
began with
( or at least it is the first i recall seeing )
the television show `` kung fu '' during the early seventies.an interesting sidelight is that as the credit roll during the end some demonstration of the cinematographic technique employed are revealed .
there are enough dramatic 
humorous and instructive moment in this movie
to make it a solid choice for nature buff .
perhaps because of some selective editing
( sparing us ,
as it were 
from the grisly end of a prey-predator moment )
and the fact
that this footage had been released in 2007
and is available on dvd
it is a solid film in its own right .
and you can take your kid ! three star .
