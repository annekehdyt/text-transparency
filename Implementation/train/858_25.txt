`` darkness '' was entertaining to some degree ,
but it never seemed to have a plot ,
lacking one more so than other film
that have been accused of this detriment ; i.e .
`` bad taste '' .
it started off really good 
with a man running from something .
it was very creepy for these first few minute ,
but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore ,
which was hard to make out at some point due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway .
the film was hard to believe
because of the juvenile acting ,
which most of the time ,
seemed like some friend talking to a video camera ,
making line up
as they went .
that 
with a lack of any plot whatsoever 
made it look
like the film was started without ,
and ended without 
a script of any kind .
as said before 
gore was this film 's only drawing point ,
which much of the time was hard to make out .
