some film are so bad
that they are good .
this is clearly not one of them .
based on a true story ,
this film was about as true to the story as pinocchio 's chance
of becoming a real boy .
the acting was terrible ,
the direction was poor ,
and it travelled way too fast .
it was as if the director just wanted to get it over
and done with and go home.nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress ,
but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway .
like most of her other film 
she let down her character
by hamming them up too much ,
talking too quickly
as if speeding up her word is going to make her more dramatic .
she really ings out the sense
that there is a crew in front of her
and she is talking to a camera ,
when she should be engaging the viewer in her character .
it pretty much let down the whole film ,
and any leg
that
it may
have had left
to stand on ,
is ruined.probably the only good thing about the film is
when she got nailed in the end .
but even that was not satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film.watch
it
if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast .
