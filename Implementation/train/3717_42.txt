justin goes home to live with his strict 
hard-nosed police detective father ,
but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartment
each with bizarre tenant residing in them .
straight-laced idealist justin is thrust into the world of the occult 
murder 
under-aged drinking and other dastardly thing .
ho-hum wow 
have i seen the same film
that nearly all the other reviewer on here saw ? ? ?
clever 
compelling 
original 
intense 
clever 
genius ? ? ? ? ! ! ?
i witnessed none of those thing .
what i did see was an uninteresting 
bland 
trite 
extremely clich\u00e9d low-budget thriller
that was ripe with implausibility and no tension in the least bit
as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film
as he gives his monologue/debate/discussion .
and where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moment ?
i never so much as chuckled ,
perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film.my grade :

( making of

desiree gould 
and raine brown ; alternate scene ; blooper ; a music video for 'addiction ' ; a trailer for this movie ; and trailer for `` shock-o-rama ''
