ted v. mikel 's film corpse grinder 2 is 103 minute of excruciating cinematic swill .
the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business
dealing among person
who grind corpse into cat food while cat alien ,
who are losing a war with dog alien ,
looking to get some of this cat food .
watching this movie ,
i began to look for any kind of distraction 
anything to reassure myself
that i was doing something else
besides losing my mind from the inside out.several scene go on for far too long ,
as character take forever to do simple thing .
i have heard
that mr. mikel does not like to use jump cut too often ,
fearful
that they will confuse his audience .
i am not sure
if this attitude is `` avant-garde '' or just `` stupid . ''
try as i might ,
i could not ing myself to care about any of the character in the unnecessarily huge cast 
well with the possible exception of the old man
who are the caretaker of the factory .
the majority of the cast are a bunch of no-talent amateur
who do not even bother to learn the lyric to `` amazing grace ''
before they have to sing it on camera .
although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality ,
since i only actually heard around 80 % of the dialogue
while watching the dvd.this is quite possibly the worst film to ever
be shot .
i have listened to snippet of the commantary ,
and mr. mikel comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man ,
what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash ?
i would like to hear the explanation from the old man
who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting
to be ground up .
movie i have long hated suddenly seem a lot better .
i long for the intermittedly appropriate music of excalibur 
and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead .
i need to go do something 
anything .
do not see this movie .
