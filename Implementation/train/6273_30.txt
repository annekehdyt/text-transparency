if it were not for the `` oh so gourgous 
''
natassia malthe ,
this b- movie would not have been worth one sector of my tivo disk space !
in what low rent 
back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in ?
`` continuity person ! ''
it is a basic principle in real movie
making !
by night an alleged space port and by day
( night and day on a space station ? )
a warehouse ! ? ? ! ?
person please !
the only thing i will commend this movie for ,
is the wardrobe dept .
for continuously ,
keeping natassia in those tight shape
revealing outfit !
even the woman
who saw this bomb
had to appreciate the outfit
that she obviously spent some time
getting into 
each day of filming !
the sci-fi channel would have been better off showing spaceball !
at least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable.p.s .
michael ironside 
please fire your agent asap !
you are so much better of an actor ,
to be even associated with this level of movie making .
