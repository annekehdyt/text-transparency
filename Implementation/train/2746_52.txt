a hilarious neil simon comedy
that evokes laugh from beginning to end .
the late walter matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian
who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner
( the late oscar-winner george burn )
for a final reunion show on stage.benjamin martin is matthau 's agent and nephew ,
and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burn .
i love matthau 's grumpy character
-- he is just the same
as he always is ,
and yet also very different.burn 
as the absent-minded old man 
is just as funny as matthau.matthau :
want some cracker ?
i have got coconut 
pineapple and graham.burn :
how about a plain cracker ? matthau :
i do not got plain .
i got coconut 
pineapple and graham.burn :
okaymatthau :
they are in the cupboard in the kitchen.burn :
maybe later.or how about this :
matthau :
when i did black ,
the white knew
what i was saying !
you have got to see it in the movie
to understand
it ! all in all 
a refreshingly hilarious 
sweet 
heartfelt 
warm 
belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quote of all time .
they just do not make them like this anymore !
in a time
when all the newest comedy are crude 
juvenile and stupid ,
this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is
-- funny character 
smart and funny dialogue 
and grand entertainment.one of the best buddy comedy of all time 
right up there with `` plane 
train and automobile 
'' `` lethal weapon 
'' and `` the hard way .
`` you may have a hard time
finding this for rent or on tv ,
but trust me 
it will be worth your time !
4.5/5 stars.- john ulmer
