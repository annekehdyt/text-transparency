che :
part one was a fascinating experiment ,
which did not only tell a very interesting story ,
but it also tried to do something different with the `` biopic '' genre.che :
part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one 
from the extraordinary performance
( specially from benicio del toro )
to steven soderbergh 's illiant direction ,
without forgetting its intention of eaking with the conventional rule from the biopics.that is what i admire from soderbergh 's experiment ...
they always try to do something different and unusual ,
and they succeed most of the times.the final message from this film is perfect ,
and it includes everything we have been told about che guervara 's life.the only fail i found on che :
part two is that a few part felt a bit irrelevant.in summary ,
i give che :
part two a very enthusiastic recommendation
because 
as the first one 
it is a ave and fascinating experiment
which challenges the spectator
and leaves us thinking .
