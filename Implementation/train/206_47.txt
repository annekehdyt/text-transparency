okay 
let 's face it .
this is a god-awful movie .
the plot
( such as it is )
is horrible 
the acting worse .
but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only 
like all of those awful mario lanza movie ...
just to hear the voice of the star 
in this case pavarottus in his prime .
okay 
so maybe
the lanza movie were also an excuse for him
to hit on woman ,
but this movie is about hearing luciano .
that alone is worth watching the movie .
a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fear ,
finds humility
and love along the way ,
and belt out a lot of hit number ,
too.i must admit i am prejudiced on a number of level .
i am italian .
i am a big pavarottus fan
( is there anything about pavarottus
that is not big ,
including his fan base ? ) .
and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own ,
seeing the height and depth of life 's possibility and in love for the first time .
so as awful
as this movie is ,
the beautiful voice and memory are enough
to make me eathe deep of life and love again.ye ,
it is corny and awful .
but the voice is immortal and timeless ,
and the voice is what
it is all about .
so i give this movie a high rating in hope
that someone
who has never heard pavarottus
before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love ,
especially since he is now gone .
like italian food
that you have never tried before ,
try it !
you may be pleasantly surprised 
as a luciano lover or prospective pavarottus peep .
