okay at first this movie seemed pretty good
even though it was moving rather quick
and even though they only had a $ 60,000 budget
it was good but
if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out
who might have killed
her why would you go chase him around
and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it
and end up running from him all retarded
and get yourself killed ?
plus after you found your sister dead in the lake
and found a clue and figured out
who the killer was why
would not you hand
that clue over to the police
who think
you killed her ?
and at the end of the movie
when she acts like her sister
who was a waitress
and she is talking to the bad guy
she should of met him somewhere
and recorded him saying
she was dead
and what happened for her `` proof '' .
i do not know i was not happy with the ending .
this movie could of been so much better
if it lasted longer
and the acting was better
and if the ending did not suck so bad !
do not waste your money on this movie
because
if you do you will be writing a review on here too
and will not be happy .
