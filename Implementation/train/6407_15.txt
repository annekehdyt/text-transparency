one of the most nihilistic and utal film i have ever seen ,
but also one of the most tragic
and moving one .
this is an action-melodrama like the world
has never seen it before .
sometimes the plot got me close to tear ,
while in the next moment
delivering shocking revelation like a bone-crunching blow to the gut .
chilling performance by edison chen .
the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down ,
while bit by bit losing their humanity ,
is a strong one .
featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work ,
`` dog bite dog '' is pure hk-bloodshed
without the heroism .
