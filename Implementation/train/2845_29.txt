this is one of the finest music concerts
anyone will ever see and hear .
i grew up
when all my lovin ' was and new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc 's power to spellbind any crowd of any age .
this doco goes way behind the scene
to show us life on the road not just for the band
but everyone down to the roady .
i saw this guy live in aussie 1975
and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less
than he gave almost 30 year ago .
i have a huge 5.1 surround sound system
that does do this justice
and would recommend this anyone especially a beatle fan .
this is the closest
you will get to a beatle concert today .
singer 
songwriter 
lead/rhythm/ bass guitar 
piano 
ukulele 
just pure genius .
there are few entertainer
who can stand alone with one instrument
and hold the crowd in his hand .
if you want note perfect music ,
buy a studio recorded cd .
if you want to hear raw music
as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd ,
with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd-this dvd is for you .
