because that is the only way
you will not think
this film is a total waste of time and money .
a remake of `` heaven can wait '' ,
( which was at least worth watching )
is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy .
it is more a vehicle
to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy
which does not play well on the big screen .
especially because his joke generally are supposed to be from the body of an old 
fat 
rich 
dead man
but are shown coming from rock himself .
as he insults black and whites the chemistry is all wrong .
the movie is not funny ,
poorly shot
the acting is weak at best .
go rent `` heaven can wait ''
and a live rock video and you will be way ahead of the game .
