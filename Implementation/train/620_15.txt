a great movie .
lansbury and tomlinson are perfect ,
the song are wonderful ,
the dance 
with a particular mention for the `` portobello ballet '' are gorgeous .
as for the animated section 
the match between animal has become an instant classic ;
the climax with the attack of the armature is chilling and fascinating .
i recommend to see the restored 134 minute version or at least the 112 minute video .
here in italy we have only the 98 minute version ,
although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minute .
if possible 
watch also the german videocassette :
it was generated from the 98 minute running
but it is missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scene between english person and their nazi invader !
