this bogus journey never comes close
to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure
these guy took in their first movie .
this installment try to veer away from its prequel
to capture some new blood out of the joke ,
but it takes a wrong turn and journey nowhere interesting or funny.there is almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guy
doing a rock concert
( and lot of person
watching on `` free tv ''
-- since when does that happen ? )
surely the script writer could have done something more creative ;
look at how all the random element of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation .
not in this film ,
which pretty much ended the bill and ted franchise .
the joke was over.the grim reaper is tossed into the mix 
for whatever reason .
this infusion 
like the whole plot 
is done poorly
and lacks spark for comedy or audience involvement .
there is a zz top impression ,
hammered in for no reason .
there is light 
smoke 
mirror 
noise .
but nothing really creative or funny.skip this bogus thing .
