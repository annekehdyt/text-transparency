the lead character in this movie fall into two category : smart and stupid .
simple enough.jiri machacek
( standa )
plays a hapless 
dopey guy
who gets arrested for a crime
he did not commit .
when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil 
former boss ,
the situation gets out of control.while standa
is genuinely
( but endearingly ) stupid 
his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot
who bungles everything and manage to say
and do the wrong thing every time .
without ondrej 
standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success .
with ondrej 
life will never be boring ,
but it sure will not be without a lot of headach ! ivan trojan plays zdenek 
an evil genius type
who degenerates into some hitler-esquire delusional tyrant .
zdenek and his henchman try to kill standa
to keep zdenek 's secret safe.i
am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech film .
for a relatively small country 
the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment .
the best czech movie i have seen are :
1 )
peli\u009aky and 2 )
tmavomodr\u00fd svet
( dark blue world ) .
if you see these two movie ,
you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema .
