before seeing this movie ,
i was expecting a fictional drama based
loosely on idea from the book ;
instead 
it is the book 
interrupted with dramatic scene illustrating the different `` illness . ''
that did not bother me much ,
but it hindered my enjoyment of the film .
one story or even two or three long story with excerpt from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable 
in my opinion .
if you are going to base a movie on a psychology text ,
you have got to find a more interesting ( and preferably accurate )
text than this one .
the film drags during part where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology
and would be utterly intolerable
if it were not sexual in nature
( because `` sex = interesting '' for most of us 
even me ) .
luckily 
there are several story with actual character development
that pull us in.but 
disappointingly ,
krafft-ebing 's theory of sexuality went unchallenged 
for the most part .
i was hoping
it would use story
to show how the imperfection of his archaic view of psychology
which is still held by many to this day.so 
in the end ,
what do you have ?
a detailed catalog of a few fetish and orientation 
with some mildly interesting story showing the trial and tribulation of a few `` sexual deviant ''
before they are cured .
for most of the film 
the film move with the crawling speed
( and mood )
of a wake .
and 
as an obviously low budget film 
the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier .
although i *was* pleased with the music ,
costume and interior design.i felt
this film 's subject was right up my alley ,
and i still feel
it is a below average film .
it deserves a 3/10 ;
a 4/10
if i were feeling extremely generous .
i can not imagine anyone enjoying this if
they did not already have an interest in sexual fetishism .
