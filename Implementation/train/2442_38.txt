the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year
( 2007 ) ,
two year
after it is official release ,
and after many illegal dvd 's had found its way to the public .
apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd 's lead to the release into the theater ,
with still public coming to watch.the movie is a great epic 
inging japanese culture into your house in an exiting way .
in a sometimes humorist way 
the story is told about a theater writer
who writes a story for his theater ,
since the regular kabuki theater play is something
he finds boring.at first ,
the audience might be a little bit confused
about which story we are following ,
but when the story unfold ,
we see
that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piece.the audience is left in the dark
if this is a story
that is supposed to really have happened in japanese tradition and mythology ,
but that does not matter.the way
the story is told with a love for theater 
expression 
vivid color 
humor and tragedy ,
makes this a great ride on the roller-coaster of japanese cinema as well
as theater.let yourself go completely
when you watch this movie ,
try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home.one critical point though :
the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying .
though most of it is great music ,
there are a few moment in the movie
that
i think
they should have chosen some more dramatic music .
but maybe the fact
that the story contains moment of humor
made the director choose for lighter moment in music as well .
