if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film ,
i recommend the following :
dragon :
the bruce lee storyrapa nui '' timecop 2 :
the berlin decision '' is an awful film .
awful production value .
awful acting .
awful script .
i would not recommend this film
to be watched by anyone
who seriously believes
that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advance asian american awareness in hollywood
( this film does neither .
) .i would at the very least say
that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day
if you ever come across it
while channel surfing .
if you are curious 
perhaps a rental from netflix ,
but this film is definitely not for keeps.if you are one of the few person
who watched this film as a means
to raise your asian american film awareness ,
and came away disappointed ,
then i recommend the following film for your personal viewing .
these are well-written film with high production value
that feature a talented cast of asian american actor :
better luck tomorrow mulan
