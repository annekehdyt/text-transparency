this movie is damian szifr\u00f3n 's second immersion in movie after his excellent character study in `` el fondo del mar '' .
with `` tiempo de valientes '' he creates extremely well done character 
far away from prototype and with an unprecedented chemistry between them .
i have seen szifron 's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way
but just enough to involve us emotionally with them .
his control over them is magnificent ,
so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall illiantly polished script 
the character laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer
to join them in their emotion and their evolution on screen.the spanish takes over the english 
the buenos aires urban landscape at night replace hollywood set
and the premise is just as interesting as any other ,
so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood 's machinery.but i want you to see the movie
mainly because i have never dealt with such endearing character 
all of them .
it seems the script suit
perfectly to the actor and vice versa .
i really believe with a film
making like this argentina
is really up to the competition .
