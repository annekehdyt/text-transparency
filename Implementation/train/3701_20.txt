best show since seinfeld .
she is really really funny .
her total self centeredness 
the hulking gay stoner neighbor 
the departure into song or cartoon 
make this the freshest show on tv .
one of the few show i make point of watching .
the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore
( `` oh wait now
that you are close
you do look old '' turns face with finger
and walks away lol ) ,
the cough syrup overdose 
sleeping with god ,
it is all so funny or so stupid
it is just a lot of fun .
the show weak point are her sister and the cop-only
because they are too darn normal ! !
i really can not wait until the next show ,
something i have not felt for any show in a long time .
