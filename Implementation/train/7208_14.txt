nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut 's dark tale .
notle plays howard w. campbell
who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii .
after the war 
he lives anonymously
until competing faction wish to dig up his past .
as with much of vonnegut 's work 
this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those
who use propaganda for their own aim .
nolte is fantastic - self assured
and confident as the younger campbell 
and then oken and haunted as the older man
who is forced to atone for the sin of his past .
