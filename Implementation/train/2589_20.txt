what can you say about this movie ?
it was not terrible ,
but it was not good !
two day earlier i had watched lilly
and that was one of the best gay films i have ever seen .
so this was not the best time
to watch a mediocre gay flick.the story
was silly
and the acting was ok.
it was not bad enough
to turn off ,
but it had some bad moment and some terrible stereotyping .
it was not very well cast either.would i recommend this movie ?
no you would be wasting your time and money .
i do not understand
why movie like these are made and who is funding them .
spend your time watching noah 's arc on logo instead .
i think
this is where this movie was trying to go
but never got there .
