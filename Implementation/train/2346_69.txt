just finished watching the groove tube
which i first saw about 23 year ago
when i was a teenager staying up way past my bedtime watching hbo with my other and his best friend .
we had also watched animal house just
before that so we saw two movie
that starred an snl alumna and had some naked east .
good thing our parent were asleep the whole time !
anyway 
there were lot of weird
and funny thing in this movie
that were eye-opener like the brown 25 sequence of the uranus industry commercial
( `` with the taste of beef stew ''
says
the announcer as what is apparently human excremant comes out of a white tube .
ewww ! )
or the face of the puppet talking about vd
( a scrotum with a small penis with eye glued on ) .
chevy chase and richard belzer made their feature film debut here .
chase is hilarious whether doing a geritan spot with a woman stripping ,
having his hand have sex in a `` let finger do it '' commercial ,
or singing `` four leaf clover '' with co-writer/director ken shapiro drumming his hand on his head .
belzer team with shapiro in `` the dealer '' movie 
and on `` channel one evening news '' with one wild bit having belzer as a black prostitute trying trick on reporter ken
who plays lionel here .
`` lionel 
that sounds like a train
that i am going to ride like a choo-choo ! ''
other outrageous bit include `` the koko show '' with shipiro as a kid clown show host
who ,
after ordering the `` person over ten ''
to leave the room ,
reads request of his viewer like passage of `` fanny hill '' !
or how about the olympic segmant with a german couple making love being announced by two man
( one of them spanish )
as they get explicit
while `` please stand by '' keep interrupting on the screen !
or the animated segmant on `` the dealer ''
which depicts dancing toilet
after shapiro ingested some marijuana !
not everything 's so dirty .
besides the `` four leaf clover '' skit 
at the end there is a highly amusing music segmant with ken lip-syncing his own recording of `` just you ,
just me ''
while dancing with suit and iefcase around the city with occasionally a cop
( co-writer lane sarasohn )
joining in .
so 
in summation this is one weirdly ,
funny movie
that seemed to influence other like film
( tunnelvision 
kentucky fried movie )
and possibly saturday night live
( which made chevy
that show 's first star )
and ,
despite some dated elemants ,
can still amuse today .
p.s .
while i liked hearing curtis mayfield 's `` move on up '' during the gorilla dancing/hitchhiking beginning sequence ,
i did wonder
what the point was with the sequence of the hitchhiker and the woman
who picked him up ,
having them running from the car ,
stripping on the run ,
and then having the naked man get caught by the cop
who stopped on the road .
guess
it is one of those '70 streaking thing ...
