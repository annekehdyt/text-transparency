in light of bad review - or car crash - i feel possessed to get in gear
and make a transmission
to give merit where due ,
and do a service .
i am not sure person have license
to say
it was so bad ,
almost automatically.it is rare for a movie to have suspense .
this movie maintained suspense it is whole length 
for me ,
despite any flaw
that may be .
how many film can say that ?
not even many big one .
because of the simple premise you do not know
if the person will get out of the life-threatening situation ,
which lasts the whole movie .
yeh 
the suspension was tight ,
and over some bump the shock did their work .
it is not just a tv movie ,
but an all-action movie ; there is no point
where it stops 
or deviate 
or becomes talky .
it would be hard to make a film like this ,
always on the road .
only duel 
or speed 
are this that i recall .
the best thing
in them also was the constant tension.acting is not bad :
the judge is as good as ever ,
and the other are .
script is good .
but the jury is out
as to whether it sometimes may be -
or seem to be - a little awry .
what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so .
your first judgment are not always right ,
but i think
the lead actor 's was right
in being in this movie.stunt
are mostly terrific 
especially for a tv movie .
their only failing may be the noticeable 
and again 
apparent 
slow speed .
but we all know
how deceivingly slow grand prix car can look.i liked
that the beginning said ,
`` inspired by a true story . ''
so you are not going to go how much is true ?
you know just the basis is .
the usual `` based on a true story ''
makes me think
it should mostly be true .
but maybe that is my error.how to save them :
good idea of the reviewer
to suggest a tow truck
to lift the back wheels up .
just a few inch would do .
a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph .
odd
that they did not call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic -
to see
if there is a way.i hope
this review has put in reverse
that this film is a disaster .
or at least neutral .
and help it become a runaway success.pic quality is a little soft for a dvd.spoiler :
they would have been winched out
after the baby was ,
but strangely that life-saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation
to fade it out .
i guess we know why .
end of movie .
suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby .
