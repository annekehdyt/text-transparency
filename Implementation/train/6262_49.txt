when deathtrap was first released 
the poster
-- reproduced on the cover of this dvd --
offered a graphic akin to a rubik 's cube .
it is an appropriate image :
originally written for the stage by ira levin ,
who authored such memorable work as rosemary 's baby and the stepford wives ,
the play was one of broadway 's most famous twister 
and under sidney lumet 's direction
it translates to the screen extremely well.deathtrap is one of those film
that it is very difficult to discuss ,
for to do so in any detail
gives away the very plot
for which it is famous .
but the opening premise is extremely clever :
sidney bruhl
( michael caine )
is the famous author of mystery play ,
but these day he seems to have lost his touch .
after a particularly utal opening night 
an old student named clifford anderson
( christopher reeve )
sends him a script for a play
he has written .
it is called `` deathtrap 
''
and sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit .
just the sort of hit
that would revive his career ... indeed ,
a hit
to die for .
and when clifford visits to discuss the play ,
event suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible.like anthony shaffer 's equally twisty sleuth ,
deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen
-- to reach full power
it needs the immediacy
that a live performance offer .
still 
under the expert guidance of director sidney lumet 
it makes a more-than-respectable showing on the screen .
much of this is due to the cast ,
which is remarkably fine .
michael caine gives a truly illiant performance ,
dyan cannon is funny and endearing as sidney 's relentlessly anxious wife ,
and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career .
if you can not see it in a first-rate theatrical production ,
this will more than do until one comes along.gary f. taylor
