... it even beats the nasty `` raw '' .
almost twenty year old is this show
and still i laughed very much
when i was watching it last night .
it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothe
( old school )
and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family .
he was only 22-year old then
and this is a must-see ! 8/10
