kenneth branagh 's `` hamlet '' hits all the mark .
the acting is magnificent ,
the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous ,
the oscar-nominated costume and set are stunning 
and patrick doyle 's score
( also oscar-nominated )
is sensitive and moving .
oh yeah - the screenplay ,
by some guy
named will s. ,
is not too bad either .
film critic ribbed branagh for receiving the film ' fourth oscar nod for `` adapting '' the screenplay ,
but his decision
to use the full text
was a gutsy one .
i can not think of many better way
to make four hour fly by.nearly every decision branagh makes work illiantly :
the use of england 's blenheim palace for exterior 
the edwardian dress ,
and the staging of `` to be or not to be '' in a hall of mirror ,
to name a few .
the casting of hollywood luminary such as robin william 
billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor part can be distracting ,
but that is nitpicking .
the principal cast excel :
derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius ;
kate winslet acutely depicts ophelia 's descent into madness ;
julie christie ings passion to her portrayal of gertrude ;
richard brier is pitch-perfect as the conniving polonius ;
and nichola farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship .
every speech 
every line 
every word is delivered with passion and conviction ;
there is not a wasted moment in the entire film .
the final scene magnify the extent of shakespeare 's tragedy in a way
not possible with theatrical adaptations.branagh 's `` hamlet '' is a bold 
ambitious ,
and ultimately successful attempt
to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeare 's language with equally eloquent imagery .
it is arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed \u0096 strong praise 
but well deserved .
