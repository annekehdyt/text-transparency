i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall ,
but four thing really stand out :
sam raimi 's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy
( ?
) man 
alan arkin 's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner 
and best of all 
the cinematography .
the beautiful golden tone of the exterior scene draws me into the film
like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories.the dialog
and mood feel very natural and believable .
some reviewer criticise the lack of a more `` profound '' script .
to me 
it is exactly that lack
that makes this film work .
the character and their problem seem real
and because of that 
i care about what happens to them.the bottom line is that all the part come together
to create a whole
that feels right .
