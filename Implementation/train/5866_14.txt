i thought
`` the river of souls '' was a very good babylon 5 movie 
with some exceptional performance from martin sheen 
tracy scoggin and ian macshane .
if this were an episode of the series
( without the humour )
it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone story of the series.personally ,
i have always preferred scoggin to christian ,
although granted jms did not write her as well for much of the series
and she did have to endure the byron/telepath plot .
if you take out the smutty humour about the othel and the `` poorer '' actor in those scene ,
then this movie is solid stuff .
probably my third favourite of the four movie ,
but in no mean bad at all .
