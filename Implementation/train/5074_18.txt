i enjoyed it .
in general 
i am not a fan of comedy and comedian ,
but i do like whoopi .
i am also partial to sci/fi fantasy .
and the dinosaur craze .
i read for pleasure ,
but when i am feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead 
i watch tv and movie to escape .
theodore rex enabled me to do so .
that makes it a success in my eye !
i did not even walk away
to do something else
while it was running .
whether or not it was rated as `` good '' or not does not really matter to me .
and no 
i am not a juvenile .
nor am i a moron .
