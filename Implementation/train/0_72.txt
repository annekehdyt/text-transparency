silent night 
deadly night 5 is the very last of the series ,
and like part 4 
it is unrelated to the first three except by title
and the fact
that it is a christmas-themed horror flick.except to the oblivious ,
there is some obvious thing
going on here ...
mickey rooney plays a toymaker
named joe petto
and his creepy son 's name is pino .
ring a bell 
anyone ?
now 
a little boy named derek heard a knock at the door one evening ,
and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him .
even though it said
`` do not open till christmas '' ,
he begins to open it anyway
but is stopped by his dad ,
who scolds him and sends him to bed ,
and opens the gift himself .
inside is a little red ball
that sprouts santa arm and a head ,
and proceed to kill dad .
oop 
maybe he should have left well-enough alone .
of course derek is then traumatized by the incident
since he watched it from the stair ,
but he does not grow up to be some killer santa ,
he just stops talking.there is a mysterious stranger lurking around ,
who seems very interested in the toy
that joe petto makes .
we even see him buying a bunch
when derek 's mom takes him to the store
to find a gift for him
to ing him out of his trauma .
and what exactly is this guy doing ?
well 
we are not sure
but he does seem to be taking these toy apart to see what makes them tick .
he does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him
to pay him in cash the next day
and present him with a `` larry the larvae '' toy for his kid ,
but of course `` larry '' is not a good toy
and gets out of the box in the car and of course 
well 
thing are not pretty.anyway ,
eventually what is going on with joe petto and pino is of course revealed ,
and as with the old story 
pino is not a `` real boy '' .
pino is probably even more agitated and naughty
because he suffers from `` kenitalium ''
( a smooth plastic crotch )
so that could account for his evil way .
and the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too ,
and there is even kind of a happy
ending of sort .
whee.a step up from part 4 
but not much of one .
again 
brian yuzna is involved ,
and screaming mad george ,
so some decent special effect ,
but not enough to make this great .
a few leftover from part 4 are hanging around too 
like clint howard and neith hunter ,
but that does not really make any difference .
anyway 
i now have seeing the whole series out of my system .
now if i could get some of it out of my ain .
4 out of 5 .
