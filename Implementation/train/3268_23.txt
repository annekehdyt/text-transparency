i never much liked the myra movie ,
tho i appreciate
how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time .
certainly miss welch 's costume became an iconic image ,
though i have to wonder if many person
who recognize the image
really saw the film
and know
what it was all about -i rewatched myra on fmc a couple of year ago
and did not think
it had aged any better thru the year .
there is a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic book ,
where it is given proper credit
for putting such big star in what was then an outrageous production .
however 
imho 
the movie is too bitter to be charming 
too silly to be a turn-on ,
and so busy
trying to shock
that it fails to inform 
engage 
or entertain -- -
