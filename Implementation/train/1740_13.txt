the story would never win award ,
but that is not what it is about ...
the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough
to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scene .
who needs a story with fighting like that ?
really 
it is worth watching for that reason alone .
if you can handle the gore ,
of which there is a lot ...
none of it done realistically enough
to be tough
to look at .
i gave it a 7 .
