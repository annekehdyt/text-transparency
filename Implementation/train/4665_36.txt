here are some example of pat robertson dubiously
claimed `` relatively good track record '' on predictionin his widely reported comment from the january 2 edition of the christian broadcasting network 's the 700 club ,
during which he predicted
that there would be `` very serious terrorist attack '' and `` mass killing '' in the united state in the `` second half '' of 2007 
host pat robertson boasted
that he had `` a relatively good track record '' on earlier prediction .
but a review of robertson 's 2006 new year 's prediction undermine
that claim .
he predicted 
for example 
that :
* `` president bush is going to strengthen . ''
wrong* `` the fall election will be inconclusive ,
but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge . ''
wrong* `` the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion .
we will begin withdrawing troop before the end of this year . ''
way wrongfurther ,
as a january 3
associated press article reported ,
robertson has a history
of making dubious prediction :
the oadcaster predicted in january 2004
that president bush would easily win re-election .
bush won 51 % of the vote
that fall ,
beating democratic sen. john kerry of massachusetts .
wrongin 2005 
robertson predicted
that bush would have victory after victory in his second term .
he said
social security reform proposal would be approved wrong yet again !
he claims to speak directly with god ...
if so god has quite the sense of humor
watching pat make a fool
of himself again
and again..
