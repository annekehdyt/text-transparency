10/10 for this film.i am a itish india doctor ,
currently in india .
the word beckham put me off ,
'cos i am a die hard liverpool fan ,
and personally think
that owen is really cool .
since liverpool and man utd are rival ,
i was dead sure
that i would not watch the film.but then i was in delhi
to meet some friend ,
and i had an early morning flight ,
so i thought ,
`` what the heck 
let 's bide time
by watching this film '' ,
'cos it was a late night show.what a moron i was .
i should have seen this film the day
it was released .
i guess
using beckham 's name was to draw audience attraction
( which had back-fired in my case ! ! !
) 
but then i really can not think of a better title for the film.and nagra 
knightley
( drop dead gorgeous ) ,
and rhys-myer did a superb job.if you hate football ,
dislike manchester united
( or england for that matter ) ,
then this is definately the film for you .
in fact 
i am just 29 yr old 
a psychiatrist by profession 
but a kid at heart .
this film has knocked `` star war '' off my no.1 position.surprisingly ,
there are not very many comment on this film by indian-it like me .
i wonder why ? 10/10 for this film .
