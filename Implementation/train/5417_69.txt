this an free adaptation of the novel of clarence mulford ;
fan of the willaim boyd film will probably feel a little at sea here
( and the review here so far reflect that ) .
but i knew of hopalong from the novel first ,
and never cared much for the boyd film
once i got around to them.christopher coppola
has made a wise choice -
he has not made a nostalgic `` western '' ;
instead 
he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call 'americana ' ;
or what older critic once called 'homespun ' .
as the film unraveled 
i found myself more and more reminded of the great `` hallmark theater '' version of mark twain 's `` roughing it '' ,
with jame garner narrating.both these film remind us
that ,
although film about the 'old west ' are probably always to be mythic for american ,
they need not be 'western ' ;
they can very well be just film about what it meant to be american in that time ,
in that place.i never feel pandered to ,
watching this film ;
there is no effort
to shove the boyd-cassidy legacy down our throat 
no irony 
no camp .
consequently 
i get a sense of these character
as having walked - or ridden horseback
- across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred year ago.given
that 
the plainness of the film -
it positively avoids anything
we have come to call `` style '' -
is all to its favor ;
and the plain acting of the performer fits
neatly in with this ; gosh ,
it really does feel
like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing 
just the quirk and good humor - and sudden violence -
that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn .
i was very pleasantly surprised by this film ,
and
if the viewer set aside encultured expectation ,
he or she will find considerable pleasure in it.i would have given this film 9-stars ,
but i will give it a ten
just because most reviewer here have missed the point completely ;
and i urge them to set their memory of boyd aside and give this film another chance.note 1 :
a reviewer complained
that hopalong shoots person dead in this film ,
rather than shooting the gun out of their hand
( ala boyd 's cassidy ) ; first 
cassidy does shoot person dead in the novel ; second ,
if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot person dead - the problem with shooting gun out of person 's hand is that they can always get another gun -
which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film.note 2 :
i admit
that i am jealous of the coppola family ,
that they have the director of `` the godfather '' among them
who can get them all opportunity
to make movie
that i can not ;
but a good movie is a good movie ;
and this is a good movie .
if it is by somebody by the name `` coppola '' 
well ,
that is just is as it is .
america is the land of opportunity
( or was ,
until bush got into office )
-
that is what the great american novel are all about .
