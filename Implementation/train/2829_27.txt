this movie is ridiculous .
anyone saying
the acting is great
and the casting is superb
have never seen even mediocre cinema .
the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 character
you meet .
lame .
i feel
like all the other `` soaring '' comment must have been made by person
associated with the filmmaker .
i was not very impressed by the storyline ,
but just wanted to see some beautiful oregon countryside ,
and there was some decent cinematography
-- but the casting was anything but inspired .
i think
this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion
that something deep in the amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost
and that reviving it is worthwhile 
and possible .
it place joke in the wrong and all-too-obvious place ,
and makes me think
it was written by the state department or something .
back to the drawing board .
to even suggest
that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classic like harold and maude is absolutely retarded ,
and along the same line of begging and pretension and `` joking '' as is rampant in this film .
