audiard made here a very interesting movie .
it begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman ,
in its working universe as a secretary ;
she is ignored 
frustrated ,
rejected ...
hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life :
but the guy is just coming out from jail .
their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively .
characters'description is profund 
goes into detail ...
both start to help each other ;
for she can read on lip ,
which reveals itself to be very useful for him ...
she will progressively evolve ,
far from what she was at first.it is beautifully filmed ;
the whole is very convincing ,
even if it turns into a film noir at the end .
gesture is in particular beautifully
observed in audiard 's filming .
emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar award for her magistral play .
action towards the end of the film
prevent
it from being a simple `` etude de moeurs '' .
it is actually surprisingly entertaining :
8/10 .
