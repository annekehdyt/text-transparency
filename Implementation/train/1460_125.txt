midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice-over of the main character joe buck
( jon voight )
singing in the shower .
he is singing a cowboy song ,
the very thing he strives to be .
joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas
and move it to new york city with the dream of lot of woman 
and even more money .
he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy 
but in a cartoonish fashion 
not even his friend take him seriously .
he begin his journey on the bus to nyc
and we can quickly see
how diluted joe is through his interaction with the other passenger .
this is primarily a story of joe 's realization of the harsh reality of the real world.he starts off as a very na\u00efve southerner thinking
he can make it in nyc just on his good look .
he has no other reason to think otherwise ,
as they proved helpful in the past ;
we learn this from the many flashback
he has .
in the beginning the flashback are filmed in a way
that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical .
they are hazy and the voice sound
as if they are coming from a great distance ,
as they are ,
they are coming out of his past .
however ,
as joe delves deeper
and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc
we see more of his past ,
which is no longer whimsical but gritty 
filmed in black and white with rapid editing
to portray the cruel nature of the past event .
this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted ,
and her being raped .
in one of these flashback we see
a building being torn down ick by ick .
this mirror the way
in which joe himself is falling apart ;
the naivet\u00e9
that he once carried
is falling off of him .
he and ratso
( dustin hoffman )
are living in squalor ,
and barely able to get food to eat ;
joe is realizing
he can not live off of his look ,
that there is a gritty underbelly of new york
that he did not envision .
his subconscious mirror the way
in which his real life is panning out.ratso
is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe 
but in an opposite way ;
ratso is joe 's foil .
joe is a handsome 
strong man
who 
for the most part 
has a good outward appearance .
ratso 
on the other hand 
from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar
we can tell
he is the opposite .
he is short 
dark ,
and always coated with a sheen of sweat .
he understands how the world works ,
that it is unforgiving ,
and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail ;
just as his father did .
they are living in the same world 
the same apartment even ,
but they understand thing on a completely different level.the theme of alienation 
one
that is common of this era ,
is very apparent in this film .
neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture
surrounding them .
joe feel
trapped in texas and move to nyc
where he is still very much an outsider .
ratso ,
living in the cold of nyc ,
wishes to move to sunny florida
where he thinks
he will be able to find a good life .
even though this is his ideal ,
in the fantasy we get from ratso 's perspective ,
it is apparent
that he knows
he will never really fit into society .
in said
fantasy he is turned on by the person
living around him ,
he is yet again an outsider ,
alienated from society.it is not until the end
that the gap between joe and ratso begin to narrow .
joe resort to violence ;
he takes on the mentality of this city
in order to get money to fund a mean of escape for florida for himself and ratso .
on the journey we see joe coming out of a store
not wearing the cowboy clothe
that he is never without in the rest of the film .
he is dressed as someone
who look like they are headed to florida for vacation .
he dresses ratso the same way ;
he tires to make them fit into the new society
they are entering ,
but it is to no avail .
upon ratso 's death on the bus 
their fellow passenger once again look them upon as outsider .
even in this new culture they have entered ,
they can not escape the alienation
they have met at every turn in this film .
despite the ratso 's death 
and joe 's continued alienation 
the film ends with the hope
that joe can take his new knowledge
of how the world works and create a better life
than he would have had as a hustler in nyc .
midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society 
and alienation 
with stellar performance by both voight and hoffman .
