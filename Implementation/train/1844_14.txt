not on the same level as ring
( or ring 2 )
but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless .
i wish
north american horror producer would take a page out of the japanese horror template
and put more 'spookiness ' and less cheap shock in their flick .
lot of good example in this one 
scenes
where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress ,
photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling 
just for a second 
and more .
worth checking out
if you like the genre .
