it felt
like i watched this movie thousand time before.it was absolutely predictable.every time
the story tried to get a bit twisted ,
every time i awaited something interesting to happen ,
i saw nothing but what i expected .
like `` the ead factory opened up another facility ,
because there was not enough ead '' .
in two word :
flat story ,
that has become a clich\u00e9 ,
bad acting ,
bad special effect ...
only the dumb russian cop 
vlad ,
was a bit funny
while punishing around the bad guys.the pile of muscle was so incredibly stupid ,
that it made me laugh at him for a moment .
i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie ... it will not get worse
( because it is not possible ) :
