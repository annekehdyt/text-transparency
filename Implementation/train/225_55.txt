despite its low-key release in this country ,
and its apparent disregard in other country
( the 'r ' rating in the state can not have helped - honestly ,
just because hbc uses the c-word !
) 
this is actually a fine piece of work .
the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it ,
but it is overcome by the playing of the two leads.it is easy to win plaudit
just because you are playing a physical or mental cripple
( daniel day-lewis 
geoffrey rush 
dustin hoffman 
etc .
) 
and helena bonham-carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd ,
but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely .
in fact 
almost all her performance is conducted through her eye
( and what eye ! ) .
this is an intelligent turn from an actress
who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation 
and emerging as a figure of some stature .
award must surely follow 
though not 
ala 
for this fine performance.branagh 
one feels 
has never quite given his best on film
( except possibly 'hamlet ' ,
and there his playing was diluted by the large cast ) .
here 
though 
he tops his other appearance ,
playing to the hilt a self-loathing 
unstable ,
ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety
he has not always displayed ,
and exhibiting both intelligence and depth .
in short ,
we believe him ,
just as much
as we could not believe him as frankenstein 
as the priest in 'the proposition ' 
as the lawyer in 'the gingeread man ' 
even as andrew in 'peter 's friend ' .
this is surely his finest performance yet -
so why could he not produce the good much earlier ? as a film ,
it looks more like a television offering ,
and without its star it probably would not amount to very much .
but it is been a pleasure
to see this pair perform their sock off like this 
and i eagerly await more from them
( though not 'love 's labour 's lost ' ... ) .
8/10 
but branagh and hbc get 10/10 .
