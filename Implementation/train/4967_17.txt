`` whipped '' is one of the most awful film of all time .
it is a mean 
hateful piece of garbage
that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 ,
besides maybe `` the grinch . ''
it is not ,
as person have called it 
an insightful portrait of modern relationship .
that would be a little film
called `` high fidelity . ''
wherea
that movie was honest and sympathetic ,
`` whipped '' is hostile 
cynical 
misanthropic cinematic poison .
avoid this like so many plague ,
unless you want to see how truly bad a `` comedy '' can get .
