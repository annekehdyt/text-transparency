the late 80 's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror film
set in gloomy penitentiary setting .
renny harlin 's superbly gritty and moody `` prison '' got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling ;
it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior `` the chair 
'' john saxon 's enjoyably trashy `` death house 
'' the passable psycho picture `` destroyer 
'' and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium .
your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderhead
lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp alex
( the hugely unappealing nichola celozzi )
go to alcatraz island
to investigate the bizarre circumstance
surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star sammy mitchell
( blandly played by toni basil of `` hey micky '' fame ) .
alex 's other become possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic us civil war cavalry commandant
and goes on the expected killing spree ,
thus forcing wimpy alex to overcome his passivity
and make a stand against this ghoulish specter.although slickly photographed by nichola von sternberg ,
with a few decent gore set piece and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere
( the film was shot on location in the dismal 
rusty 
rundown ruin of alcatraz island ) ,
`` slaughterhouse rock '' nonetheless just does not cut it as a solid 
effective fright feature .
this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck character 
a tiresomely smirky bunch
whose inane comic antic prove to be grating rather than amusing .
the flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matter all the more 
with onetime `` playboy '' playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme hope
marie carlton doing an especially irritating linnea quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo .
dimitri logothetis ' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style ,
but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy 
horrendously sophomoric silliness 
and 
most damagingly 
ted landon 's sloppy 
inconsistent 
overly complicated
and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic
to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible .
in other word 
this stinker sadly succeeds
in making a scan not 90 minute seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail sentence .
