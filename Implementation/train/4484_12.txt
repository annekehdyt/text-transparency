absolutely stunning 
warmth for the head and the heart .
the kind of movie western movie maker are too rushed ,
too frenetic to even attempt .
my kid watched it ,
and they loved it too .
what real person
-- goes to show you how cultural difference
( the japanese setting )
is less important than the human similarity .
go see it ,
whether you like dancing or not .
