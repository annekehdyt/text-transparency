this is the first guinea pig film from japan
and this is the sickest 
in my opinion .
a bunch of guys torture a girl for several day
before finally killing her .
and at this point 
i will say
that these film are not real !
they are faked horror film
which try to be as realistic as possible.the scene
are sickening
but also unrealistic in many case .
for example ,
when they kick the girl in the floor ,
we can clearly see
how they kick and stump the floor near the girl !
and how stupid this looks !
the sound effect are also unrealistic
and do not make sense .
other scene include animal intestine thrown on the girl ,
the girl exposed to loud noise for many hour 
the ripping off of fingernail 
worm placed on the wound in the girl 's body 
the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that .
very sick and mean spirited film
and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significan not .
this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig ,
although it is not as bloody as the next part 
flower of flesh and blood ,
which tries to be as shocking as possible.guinea pig :
devil 's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing
i have seen and the closest thing to snuff there is .
this is still ( of course )
faked s
( n/t )
uff 
the only difference to genuine `` snuff film ''
is that no one dies or hurt for real in this film .
i can not recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive .
they
who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it .
i watched this as a curiosity
( as the other part in the series )
and now i know
how insignifican not trash these are .
they work only in shock level
and that is not too valuable cinematic achievement .
devil 's experiment is perhaps
the sickest film i have seen and mermaid in a manhole
( guinea pig 4 )
is perhaps the most disgusting film i have seen .
so these are pretty extreme in my book ,
but that is all they are .
