i completely disagree with the other comment posted on this movie .
for instance 
the movie is based on the book
and if the writer had a gay character
in it then how could `` hollywood '' just throw in a token gay character in the movie .
and besides there was two gay character
and i thought
they reflected each other great .
one was normal
and the other was more feminine
but it was not over the top .
and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance
and if the other reviewer had the decency
to actual watch the entire film
they would have seen
that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other character .
for instance when she and adam went to look at the car
that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come
out and later in the film you saw
that she too was invincible .
but i guess
if you are too worried about gay character and character
that are flawed then this movie is bad .
but if you are more open-minded and i do not know actually have some inkling of what is good then you will enjoy this film .
