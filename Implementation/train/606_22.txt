this tv film tells
the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friend and family 
but unaware of her mother 's death .
her sister runs the family home ,
but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband .
frannie strongly objects to the idea ,
and vow to keep the family heirloom
as it were ,
by getting a job
and maintaining responsibility.in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love
( as you do ) ,
and it is from this point that i sort of lost interest ... .there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks ,
she can portray a character extremely convincingly
when she puts her mind
to it -
and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous effort like extremity and small sacrificy - a great performance from the legendary charlie 's angel.silk hope is the type of film
that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image ,
and you know
there was a limit to the budget ,
but it is not the worst film ever made .
the positive aspect are there ;
you just have to find them .
