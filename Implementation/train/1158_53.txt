or anyone
who was praying for the sight of al cliver wrestling a naked ,
7ft tall black guy into a full nelson ,
your film has arrived !
film starlet laura crawford
( ursula buchfellner )
is kidnapped by a group
who demand the ransom of $ 6 million
to be delivered to their island hideaway .
what they do not count
on is rugged vietnam vet peter weston
( cliver )
being hired by a film producer
to save the girl .
and what they really did not count on was a local tribe
that likes to offer up young woman to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eye.pretty much the same filming
set up as cannibal ,
this one fares a bit better
when it comes to entertainment value ,
thank mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eye
( franco confirms
they were split ping pong ball on the disc 's interview ) .
franco gets a strong eurocult
supporting cast
including gisela hahn
( contamination )
and werner pochath
( whose death is one of the most head-scratching thing i ever
seen as a guy
who is totally not him
is shown -
in close up -
trying to be him ) .
the film features ton of nudity and the gore
( tempra paint variety )
is there .
the highlight for me was the world 's slowly fistfight between cliver and antonio de cabo in the splashing wave .
sadly 
ol ' jess pads this one out to an astonishing
( and 
at time 
agonizing )
1 hour and 40 minute
when it should have run 80 minute top .
for the most part 
the severin dvd looks pretty nice
but there are some odd ghosting image going on during some of the darker scene .
also 
one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs
( they are an option ,
but only when you listen to the french track ) .
franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film
and has much more pleasant thing to say about buchfellner than his cannibal star saina siani .
