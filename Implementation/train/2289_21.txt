i 
like many horror fan 
have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remake and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 year .
here 
at last 
is an original horror genre movie
that ticks all the right boxes.you want a hot lead actress ,
you want vampire ,
you want cool weapon ,
you want cool vehicle
and you want blood ,
lot of it 
by the bucket load -
you got it.with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham ,
this really is fantastic stuff.despite
it is low budget 
by opting
to use 35 mm stock
and adding quality cg effect to the mix ,
director jame eaves has created something
that feels much bigger.a must for old school horror fan .
