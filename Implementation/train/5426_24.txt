this movie sucked .
it really was a waste of my life .
the acting was atrocious 
the plot completely implausible .
long 
long story short 
these person get `` terrorized '' by this pathetic `` crazed killer '' ,
but completely fail to fight back in any manner .
and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip 
with no gear ,
and show up at a campsite
that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothe and the daughter headphone .
additionally ,
after their boat goes missing ,
they panic
that they are stuck in the wood ,
but then the daughter boyfriend just shows up
and they apparently never consider
that they could just hike out of the wood like
he did to get to them .
like i said 
this movie sucks .
a complete joke .
do not let your girlfriend talk you into watching it .
