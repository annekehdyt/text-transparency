firstly 
this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen .
it incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick 
sexual humour 
and cleverly-thought-up stand-up .
but it goes deeper than that .
the souler opposite is an original love story
( something
we do not see that often )
that gave me hope
that there is love out there ;
that two person
who love each other can work through their adversity ;
and that such a comedic take on life
( something i believe
we all should have )
can be accepted by the person
that really matter .
chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer
that he should have won an oscar .
the film is illiantly written and i hope
we will be seeing more film from everyone
involved in the future .
