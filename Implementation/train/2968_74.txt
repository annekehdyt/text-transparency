you should not take what i am about to say lightly .
i have seen many 
many film
and have reviewed a great deal of them 
in print .
so
when i tell you
that this film has the single funniest scene i
have ever seen in a movie ,
you might want to listen to me .
there is a lot of diversity of opinion
as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny
as it is .
and to those
who just did not get 
well ,
i can not blame them 
too much .
the scene i speak of ,
comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to john candy .
up until that point 
i had found the film dumb ,
confusing and it was beginning to lose me .
when this scene came up 
i laughed so hard 
i peed my pant .
no movie has ever done
that to me before .
when the project began ,
`` going berserk '' was supposed to be the sctv movie .
i remember it being announced .
as time went on ,
the cast was whittled down to john candy 
joe flaherty and eugene levy .
there also must have been a regime change at universal ,
while it was being shot ,
because upon being released ,
it was shown in nearly zero theater .
when watching this a second time ,
i listened to the theme song
( which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is 
in the lyric ) 
relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on .
aside from the aforementioned routine 
`` going berserk '' has many other hilarious scene
to recommend it .
this is almost a 3 stooge flick ,
except it is much funnier .
director david steinberg has razor sharp timing ,
and he must have been laughing all through this .
as for candy ,
who 's basically in charge here ,
he has never been funnier .
with all the plot device and explanatory scene thrown out the window ,
he absolutely runs wild .
flaherty and levy follow him effortlessly .
there is a plot ,
but it is a plot like `` animal house ''
had a plot ,
and yeah 
the script is uneven ,
and a little slow to start .
once you know this 
however ,
you can well appreciate the full sctv style craziness
that transpires .
it is stupid ,
but it is stupid on purpose ,
and you need to remember
that
when you see it .
do see it ,
and discover for yourself ,
if it has the funniest scene of all time in it .
