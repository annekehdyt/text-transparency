this movie has a lot of comedy 
not dark and gordon liu shine in this one .
he displays his comical side
and it was really weird seeing him get beat up .
his training is `` unorthodox ''
and who would 've thought
knot tying could be so deadly ? ?
lot of great stunt and choreography .
very creative ! add johnny wang in the mix
and you have got an awesome final showdown !
do not mess with manchu thug ;
they are ruthless !
