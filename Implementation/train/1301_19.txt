from the critical acclaim 
i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkin .
the story just meandered along
and did not seem to have a point or a plot .
and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl
( mature for her age or no )
would be so blase
about getting the loss of her virginity `` over with . ''
maybe i am too young to relate
( i was four year old in 1976 ) ,
but i did not have any problem connecting with the story of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i was not alive for either of those setting .
the cast is very good
but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them
to engage the audience .
overall 
slum had its moment
but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter top and tube sock ,
i would say
skip this one .
