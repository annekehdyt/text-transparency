slow and nice image changed one another 
with sometimes annoying music
( you know bjork )
in background 
for the first 75 % of the movie .
if you did not have enough sleep ,
that is a good time .
but 
in the last 20 % of the movie director decides to ing idea of re-birth 
re-incarnation or else 
through sandm image :
`` spiritual lover '' are cutting each other body with knife .
for me it was very much disturbing
and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and image of modern japanese mystery .
operator and director are great 
but weird .
did not enjoy it at all .
