this film is a great fun .
i recommend you watch it yourself
and then watch it again with your friend .
i did last night
and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world !
i did feel a little bit strange
watching my friend go through the same roller coaster
as i did the first time .
but they all thanked me
and loved the movie .
you know
it is a great film
if you spend 2 hour
after the film
talking about the movie !
i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri 's level ,
but no where near the same size ring .
he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folk at my old berkeley ca a.a. group
where everyone trusts everyone else .
he would `` sponsor '' only person
who seemed very well to do .
who knew
he would have stolen in excess of 100k
( in 1987
when that was real money )
after being in town for only 1 month .
his victim were very fragile
as they were in their first month or week of being sober .
he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face.the above crime is nothing
compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor .
but i do not want to give anything away.i
just found this one night on a late night movie channel 
'' showtim ''
i think .
this is alway a movie fan greatest experience
to be totally tricked into seeing something
and having your mind blown .
just drag your friend over to see this
and do not tell them a thing .
it is a very entertaining film ,
it moves quickly
and never bore you.this should be a international classic for all time .
i believe
all great movie eventually rise to the top .
time will be very good to this film .
i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet 
in some way
that makes the surprise even better.the director and editor
were fantastic .
they deserved winning the best documentary.just watch this film !
