when this initially aired in 1984 ,
my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder .
i still have that aging tape ,
which i try to watch annually .
it was the year my first child was born ,
and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation ings back fond memory of happy time
-- many hour of which were spent with this film
playing in the background .
i finally oke down this year
and ordered a dvd ,
which prompted me to take a moment
to write this ief reaction to the movie .
charle dicken ' story is captured in outstanding fashion here .
george c. scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge .
the supporting cast is equally spectacular .
this is 
to my mind 
a flawless production .
little detail add much to the enjoyment .
the game `` simile '' scrooge 's nephew and wife play with their party guest is a neat item .
( i have since re-created it with my high school english student as a ief respite from class work ! )
honestly 
i can think of few way
to entertain myself over the holiday i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production ,
which was originally sponsored by ibm .
( incidentally 
it is fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercial ...
which show just how much computer have evolved in 21 year .
amazing how thing have changed ! )
bottom line :
a christmas carol is a timeless story ,
and this rendition is a timeless classic .
enjoy ... and god bless us 
every one !
