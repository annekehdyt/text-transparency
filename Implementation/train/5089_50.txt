i had a lot of expectation from this movie and more so
since it was a yashraj film.jimmy operates a call centre and one day
he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss 
lakhan singh 
english .
the two fall in love and decide to run away
but pooja tell jimmy
that she can not do this
as she owes a debt to lakhan singh ,
who is also known as bhaiyyaji .
but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out
that bhaiyyaji / lakhan singh is a don .
in the meantime 
bhaiyyaji hires a man 
bachchan pandey ,
to track down jimmy and pooja.starring saif ali khan 
kareena kapoor 
anil kapoor and akshaye kumar ,
the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya
and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra .
`` tashan '' has to be one of the worse film
that i have ever watched .
yes !
the scenery is good and kareena kapoor
( and her much publicised weight loss )
looks good .
but plot is extremely thin on story and at time makes no sense from one scene to the other -
hence
why i have said at the beginning
that i had expected more from this film
as it was a yashraj production .
with reference to song 
unfortunately 
there is not one song
that i can remember now.there are moment
where one can laugh
and that is mainly thank to akshaye kumar
and saif could have definitely done better
while kareena kapoor played her part well .
but this can not be said for anil kapoor -
it did not suit him at all as a villain .
lastly 
never mind aditya chopra ,
who in the past has produced and directed good film such as `` mohabbatein 
''
what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie ?
conclusion :
bad movie 
not worth wasting your time
and that is my first and last impression .
