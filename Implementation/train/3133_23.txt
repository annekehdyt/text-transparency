i can not stand most reality show
and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton ,
and sure
it is his company .
but `` you are fired ''
or `` you are hired '' 
for how many season now ?
after watching the show i would not want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think
watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.i would love to hear just one person get up
and say
`` donald i quit and take some of your money
and buy a decent hairdo '' .
i see he is even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe .
i hope he gets hurt
so i do not have to see his pathetic face anymore .
it must be sad to want fame so bad
and have no talent
and make an ass of yourself
trying to buy it .
i would give this show a negative mark
if i could
but it gets a 1
and it does not deserve that .
