there are some movie
you just know
they are going to be bad from frame one .
even if you were totally oblivious of ed wood 's work ,
one look at that commentator from `` plan 9 from outer space ''
and you just know
you are not gon na see the next cinematic masterpiece .
just like that ,
when i saw the first shot of uwe boll masterpiece `` house of dead '' ,
with that guy
sitting at the front of the house
starting his introduction
while trying desperately to sound like
he just arrived from sin city ,
i knew i am in for a helluva ride.so ,
the movie starts like this - first the lead character
says
that everybody else is going to die .
you know ,
to keep you wandering .
then he starts introducing the rest of the character with line like `` karma..think
she is foxy brown ''
or `` alicia..my ex..
we oke up recently.. i
had to study
and she had to fence '' .
no 
i am not kidding.anyway 
this bunch of 20-something
who could not act their way out of a wet paper-bag
are going to the `` rave of the century '' ,
rave in question being a few tent 
a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific .
our gang missed the ferry ,
but thankfully will find a way
to get there ,
the way
being a fisher-boat
ran by kirk
( cpt kirk ?
get it ?
man ,
whoever wrote
this script is a genius )
and his sidekick
who is a bastard child of simpson ' cpt mcallister
and that hook killer
who knows
what you did last summer.to
make the long story short ,
the gang gets to the island ,
finds nobody there except some bloody t-shirt and then decide to run the hell away from there .
no wait 
they do not ,
they actually get all happy
and like cos there is free booze.with
that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odd proceed
to go further downhill .
some guy in rubber suit
start running around ,
there is some screaming and shooting ,
our gang goes to some house
to meet some other gang ,
they go out of the house ,
meet cpt kirk and some police woman
( who between them have about 500 pound of weapon )
and then decide to go back to the house .
somewhere along the line they transform into a s.w.a.t .
team 
enter the matrix 
the rubber-suit guy start multiplying like bacterium and i start to cry
because i actually paid to see this .
to add insult to the injury ,
every few minute there are shot from the video game
this crap is based on
and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few character
when they die.i seriously hate this movie .
it does not even fit in that famed `` so bad it is good '' category .
it is just plain bad .
the script is bad ,
the zombie are awful ,
there is no tension ,
line are bad ,
actor are bad.. the list
just goes on.you will probably want to see this movie
just because of its reputation of being awful .
do not .
there are bad movie
that deserve to be watched .
this is not one of them .
