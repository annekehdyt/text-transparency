i have not followed the episode of `` enterprise '' on cable television .
i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season
and this first episode surprised me .
the adventure of the first enterprise 
captain jonathan archer 
the gorgeous t'pol 
reed 
mayweather 
dr. phlox 
hoshi and trip is excellent 
at least in this pilot .
i have noted in imdb
that this episode is actually divide in two part ,
but on dvd they are just one ,
therefore my review is valid for both .
i did not like the music score theme ,
which i found very annoying ,
but this was an exception in this great show .
my vote is nine.title
