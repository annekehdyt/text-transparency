seriously 
i absolutely love these old movie and their simplicity
but i just watched this for the first time last night
and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time .
was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombie ? ? ?
this movie was so bad
that
after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was .
thankfully i am too anal to turn a movie off
without seeing the entire thing or i would not be able to ag about watching this all the way through in one sitting !
i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life
so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film 's most positive asset ,
it was very short for a full length film .
