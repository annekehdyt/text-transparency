i love it
when they actually do a sport story well .
so many in the past have been so hokey
it was embarrassing to watch .
not this one .
it is just a genuinely nice movie 
an old-fashioned type of story -
and based on a real-life guy
to did exactly
what dennis quaid did in this film .
he plays a high school coach
who is talked into trying out 
late in life athletically-speaking ,
to become a pitcher in professional baseball .
eventually 
he reaches his goal
of making it to the major league ,
even if it was a very ief stint.all
the character in here are nice person ,
the kind you root for 
from quaid to the player on his high school team 
to his little boy
( angus t. jone 
now somewhat of a star on television .
) quaid is believable in playing jim morris
because 
unlike actor in the past in sport film ,
he knows how to throw a baseball .
he looks like a pitcher 
a guy
who could fire it 90-plus mile per hour .
and 
most of this film is true ,
as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentary on the dvd.so ,
if you are looking for a nice 
inspirational true life sport film ,
you can not wrong with this one .
