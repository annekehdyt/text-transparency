there are not many movie around
that have given me a feeling
like stardust did all throughout the course of the film .
as magically fairy-tale-like as the princess bride 
stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000 's as well as the 1990 's .
exciting 
hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable character 
michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro 's especially 
i challenge anyone to watch this movie
without a smile .
from the first ten minute of the film you know perfectly well
how it will end ,
but it is the journey and not the destination
that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.ten star ,
and not a decimal less .
