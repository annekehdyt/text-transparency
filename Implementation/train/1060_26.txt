i have had the chance
to watch several movie in bluray and hd dvd .
this movie stays to it is wonderful action and great story .
although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one
is not it .
not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier .
i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting
which do not always go together .
overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch .
now on the blu ray scale .
in many blu ray movie you either get two thing .
a picture
that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture .
i was disappointed
when i made this my first blu ray movie .
i almost began to think
that this was a blu ray standard .
although after watching other movie i know better .
i do not believe
they spent as much time
as they should have transferring this movie over to hd .
that is generally the problem with some movie .
and for the price of blu ray player and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture .
so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for person
who have either never seen the movie
or have not bought the dvd version .
