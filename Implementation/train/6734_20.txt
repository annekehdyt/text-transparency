the story of peace-loving farmer and townspeople fighting for land 
water 
law and order 
and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interest and their hired gun had been worked over better in earlier
( shane )
and probably later film as well .
there is some good action scene and the general layout of the story ,
excluding a disappointing ending ,
is well executed .
law and order and religion have established root in the town ,
but the old order of cattle drife 
cowboy 
and gunlingers is still around as well .
the clash of the two occur in a nicely staged ambush scene
where the townsman ride right into a trap .
granger 
an ex-gunfighter 
plays the guy
who is shunned by the very townspeople
who need his expertise with a gun .
