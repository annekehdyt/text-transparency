i have to say
that sometimes `` look '' are all that matter ,
just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out
( not about our earth though ,
but he is right anyway )
.and
when it comes to look ,
this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eye are about to see.and then there is the personality of the movie as well 
interesting 
with a captivating narrator voice and narrator story
that will touch your soul
as you watch those superbly filmed images.the movie probably will not affect your lifestyle ,
ruining these beauty ,
but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is.this movie deserves
it is 10 star
as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentary i truly enjoyed .
