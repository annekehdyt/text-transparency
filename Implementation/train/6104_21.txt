trio 's vignette were insightful and quite enjoyable .
it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actor
when they were very young .
the performance and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.observation .
in film it is not necessary
that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era
to be interesting or worthwhile .
`` small morality '' storytelling is quaint
( or coy )
only in the eye of the beholder
-- thankfully .
story content
-- well told --
can overcome it is time 
subject or place.ironically ,
there are quite a few contemporary film today
that have not overcome the convention
or cutting edge more of the present era .
inserting `` small morality '' content
-- occasionally --
might provide a dimension lacking .
