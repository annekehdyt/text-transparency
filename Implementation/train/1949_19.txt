great 
great 
great !
that is all i can say about that movie ,
but imdb want at least four line of text
so i will elaborate .
the cast was great
( jerry o'connel is soooo cute !
) 
the music was great
( the sixty had the best music ever 
imho ) ,
the historical material was interesting ,
and so was the way
they made the actor of the '90 seem
like they were actually there in the '60 .
and most of all - the story of the main character ought tear to my eye ,
and that is the greatness of any drama .
but in one word : great !
