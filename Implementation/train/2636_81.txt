the quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time .
pam dixon anches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospect
and make this work of art a must-see .
academy award winner brenda fricker
( home alone :
lost in new york 
a time
to kill ) ,
ben johnson
( the last picture show 
red dawn ) ,
and adrien brody
( the pianist 
the village )
amplify the atmosphere of the movie ,
drawing in an anxious audience .
however 
the dramatic performance are neutralized by quirky radio oadcaster jay o. sander
( jfk 
the day after tomorrow )
.the story is centralized around a foster child 
up-and-coming actor joseph gordon-levitt
( brick 
the lookout ) .
sidekick milton davis jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend
who never knew his parent .
the two do not have much ,
but what they do have : angel ' baseball ,
and what they are seeking :
identity .
that is when 4-time emmy nominee danny glover
( lethal weapon 
predator 2 )
comes in
to save the day
as frustrated angel manager 
george knox .
in relation 
all character in the story seem to have the same mission :
search within themselves to find out
who they really are.depressed over the fact
that roger
( jgl )
is separated from his father ,
he wishes to god for reunification
if the angel can take the pennant .
odd are astronomical ,
but 3-time emmy winner christopher lloyd
( back to the future 
my favorite martian )
comes in as the omniscient overseer
to work a little magic
( pun ) .
before you know it 
al
( lloyd )
is sitting with roger in the stand 
snacking on cracker jack ,
and causing some of baseball 's biggest boner !
dorothy kingsley and george well '
( dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner )
1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind william dear
( nominated in director guild of america ) .
he includes a touching side story centered around pitcher mel clark ,
played by tony danza
( 4-time golden globe nominee 
emmy nominee ) ,
who in relation to all other cast member is just trying to find his place in a confused anaheim .
clark has been dubbed a wash-up 
a once big-name in cinci ,
but he has something
to prove to manager knox.spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent
to committing adultery in the 18th century .
this one is a diamond in the rough ,
and it will keep you on the edge of the seat
until all come to peace .
did i mention a cameo by matthew mcconaughey
( a time
to kill 
we are marshall )
for all you ladies out there ?
