i watched about 30 minute into this film
before i finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie .
the soundtrack 
the so-called 'plot ' 
and each and every actor .
it is like they all think
they are the main part of the movie and scream `` notice me ! ''
over and over again .
the bad guy has his bad-guy music going on and says sinister bad-guy-like thing ,
just in case you did not quite catch on .
the good guy does ave and noble thing just in case you did not know
he was the good guy .
and oh lord 
the plane scene .
`` my husband is missing !
oh my god !
it is impossible
that he got up to stretch his leg or go to the toilet or anything ,
he must be missing ! ''
( and yes 
i know ,
his clothe were still there ,
but honestly ,
she woke up
and started to panic
before she even had time
to look at the damn seat
he had been in .
) as a religious girl 
i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on.and i want my 30 minute back .
