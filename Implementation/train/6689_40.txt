dietrich bonhoeffer 's writing have had a profound influence on my life as a christian ,
and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie
and finding out more about his life .
word can hardly express my disappointment .
this movie was disjointed ...
it gave no background about his life 
no historical context ,
and nothing about his great writing
( except a ief ,
passing reference to `` the cost of discipleship '' by a colleague at the beginning of the movie . )
instead 
we see him enjoying jazz
( apparently in the state )
and chilling out with his friend before he decides to go back to germany .
apparently to show his human side .
ok 
i am ready for the dramatic part .
the part where he stands up for his faith .
instead of emphasizing that ,
we get a very badly
acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl .
whether or not that actually took place ,
it should not have been a major portion of the movie .
now ... still waiting for the dramatic part ,
or some narration explaining
what his writing were all about ...
or something
to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man .
drum-roll ... ..waiting ... .. ... .waiting ... ..zip .
nada .
this is the kind of movie
that gives `` christian film '' a bad name .
all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie
to follow ,
with some background ... even some voice-over 
or flashback to him preaching from his work ...
some narrative
about who he was and where he had been .
but no ... this is what we got .
hardly fitting for a hero of the faith .
