not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed ,
but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath ,
and what i get is one bloody scene
( the eyeball )
at the tail end of asinine fake slapping 
and spinning in a desk chair 
i end up thinking `` well
that is 43 minute of my life gone forever . ''
i would not considers this or flower of flesh and blood `` movie ''
so much as an exercise of will ;
to see
if you can sit through them .
flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spot to watch .
the devil 's experiment did not .
it was at best 
stupid ,
and at worst ... well ... really stupid .
perhaps my expectation were too high .
i put the dvd thinking `` oh man ,
this is gon na be sick . ''
after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand time ,
i was watching it in fast forward.two kind of person
would be interested in this film .
1 ) person
who seek out f 'd up film
just to see how f 'd up it really is 
or 2 ) horror completest .
i sought this and the other guinea pig film for the latter reason ,
but
even if i fell into the category of the former ,
this film would not float my boat .
as a matter of fact 
i could imagine this film increasing one 's blood lust ...
as in `` would you just kill the b*tch already ! ! ''
so in conclusion 
the only reason
to own this film
is for collection purpose .
if you want carnage
that traditional horror does not provide ,
get trace of death .
sure ,
that sucks too ,
but at least you will get the blood and gut you expect.the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel
they are supposed to .
no artistic merit
that i can comprehend ,
no reason for it is notoriety 
no nothing .
just a lame attempt to be shocking .
