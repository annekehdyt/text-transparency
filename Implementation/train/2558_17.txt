this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise .
i live in minnesota and even i can not believe
they dumped cleveland .
( yes i realize at the time
the real indian were pretty good ,
and the twin had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league ,
but still be consistent . )
anyway i loved the first major league 
liked the second ,
and always looked forward to the third ,
when the indian would finally go all the way to the series .
you can not tell me this was not the plan
after the second film was completed .
what happened ?
anyway
if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor
and do not watch this junk .
