after watching `` the bodyguard '' last night ,
i felt compelled to write a review of it.this could have been a pretty decent movie
had it not been for the awful camera-work .
it was beyond annoying .
the angle were all wrong ,
it was impossible to see anything 
especially during the fight sequence .
the closeup were even horrible.the story
has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard
to anyone willing
to lead him to the top of a drug ring .
he is approached by judy lee ,
who is never quite straight with chiba .
lee 's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought ,
as the mob and another gang of thug are
after her.the story was decent ,
and despite horrible dubbing ,
this could have been a good movie .
given better direction and editing ,
i am
sure
this would have been a classic kung foo movie .
as it is ,
it is more like another cheesy 70 's action movie.note :
the opening sequence has a quote familiar to `` pulp fiction '' fan ,
and then continues to a karate school in time square
that is in no way
related to the rest of the movie.rating :
4/10
