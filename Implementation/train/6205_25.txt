this movie has made me upset !
when i think of cat in the hat .
im thinking of cat in the hat book .
you know 
the one from a few year back
that parent read to thier child .
well 
i though that this movie would be a lot like that !
but much to my suprise was nothing like the book !
insted it is more like young adult humor movie .
in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool
( hoe )
cat talk to it like it is his hoe
( agin adult humor ) .
the naming of his car i all
so though was a little untastful for a kid movie .
under the rating you will find :
mild cude humor and some double-entendre .
i think in short this means adult humor .
i wish i could return this movie !
wal-mart said
they would not because the movie has been opened .
if you are thinking about buying this i suggest
that maybe rent
before you buy .
