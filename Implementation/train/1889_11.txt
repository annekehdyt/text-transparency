i have seen a lot of bad film .
most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film
for what it is .
but this really takes badness to new extremes.it is bland ,
the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere
and takes its time over it .
there are no shock 
no horror 
no suspense 
just a load of guy rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish.a blight on the crappy horror genre ,
avoid at all cost .
