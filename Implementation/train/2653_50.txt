aspect ratio :

sound format :

( 35mm and 70mm release print )
a blind ex-journalist
( karl malden )
overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetic research laboratory
and later team up with a fellow reporter
( jame franciscus )
to investigate a series of murder at the lab ,
unwittingly placing their own loved one at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.rushed into production
following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage
( 1969 ) ,
dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tail as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner 
toplining celeated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton
( 1969 )
- and rising star franciscus
( the valley of gwangi ) .
sadly 
the resulting film -
which the ad claimed was 'nine time more suspenseful ' than `` bird '' -
is a disappointing follow-up 
impeccably photographed and stylishly executed 
but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic role 
and cinematographer enrico menczer
( the dead are alive )
uses the wide cromoscope frame
to convey the hi-tech world
in which argento 's dark-hearted scenario unfold 
but the subplot
involving euro starlet catherine spaak
( the libertine )
as franciscus ' romantic interest amount to little more than unnecessary padding .
highlight include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station
( edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli ) ,
and a nocturnal episode
in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue
inside a mouldering tomb
and fall prey to the killer 's devious machination .
but despite these flash of illiance 
the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next ,
simmering gently
without ever really coming to the boil .
it is no surprise that `` cat '' failed to emulate the runaway success of `` bird ''
when released in 1971 .
