this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot
and is all about action .
what sets it apart from other animation
is how well the human movement are animated .
it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around ,
her movement were done so well .
why do not they use this rotoscopic technique more these day ?
it is quite effective.fire and ice ,
in it is prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed woman ,
was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy way 
her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy .
some may hate this
and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy ,
other
( including plenty of woman )
will adore
it is esthetic quality .
i for sure did not mind !
bakshi just loves animating lushious 
voluptuous babe ,
as can also be seen in cool world ,
and i do not think
he has to apoligize
since it is pretty much animation for adult .
but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child
and i never forgot
it.this one was just special 
so different from the standard disney or anime fare ,
and for that reason alone well worth the watch
since it is possibly bakshi 's finest .
for those
who like animation with lushious woman :
try space adventure coa
as well.i give fire and ice 8/10 .
