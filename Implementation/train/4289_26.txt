this movie was great
and i would like to buy it.the boy goes with his grandfather
to catch a young eagle .
the boy has to feed and care for the eagle
until it is old enough
to be sacrificed for the crop .
the boy saves the eagle from being killed
and runs away from the tribe.the eagle
helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond
the boy scares up .
later the boy shoots a deer
that a bully kid was claiming
because their arrow were marked very close the same .
only until they check the thickness of the red line do
they determine
who actually got the deer .
but this was unfortunate
because it made the other boy even crueler to him ,
and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff
but
when you think
he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was.please
if anyone knows
where i can buy this movie
let me know.i have not seen it for over 30 year 
but still remember part of the movie.deniselacey2000 @ yahoo.com
