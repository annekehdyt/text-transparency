`` holly '' is an issue-driven film ,
but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental .
at its heart is it is a character-driven film ,
which would not be nearly so successful
without the fleshed-out portrayal of patrick
( ron livingston ) ,
the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience 
and holly
( thuy nguyen ) ,
the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young vietnamese girl .
from the viant location and photography to the effective editing 
everything is forthright and well-done .
the contemporary classical score may put some off at first ,
but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint
which is evident throughout .
this film ,
which raises many issue
but provides few clear-cut answer ,
ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many
who share her plight .
kudos to those
who managed to get it made .
