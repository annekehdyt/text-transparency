well 
they say
nymphomania leaf you unsatisfied .
i do not know
if stella jame
( sean young )
qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac ,
but she certainly is in to sexual relation with man .
she is still exploring ,
trying to find `` more datum ''
so she can see what she wants from life and the man in it ,
though it seems like at her age
she should have a pretty good idea by now .
( i can not agree 
however 
with anyone
who says young
is too old for the role .
if she is ,
we should all age so nicely . )
for the most part this film left me cold ,
though it is by no means the worst of its type you will ever see .
and unlike the recent 'eye wide shut 
' at least something happens in this one .
