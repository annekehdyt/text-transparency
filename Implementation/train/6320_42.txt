i watched the pie-lette last night and the word
that comes to mind
is `` original . ''
it is a word
not used much in tv
as they all tend to copy whatever
the other network is doing
and you end up with seven night of crime show 
unfunny comedy ,
and reality crap.the first thing
that hit me like a ick
was the presence of jim dale .
those not familiar with the british `` carry on ... '' series or those
who have not listened to a harry potter book ,
may not be familiar with dale .
i am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distract .
i will have to tune in more ,
but it does give the show a `` harry potter '' atmosphere .
maybe that is a good thing.lee pace
( infamous 
the white countess )
has a gift .
it never explains where he got it ,
but he can ing someone back from the dead for a minute .
he teams with chi mcbride
( `` boston public 
'' roll bounce )
to solve murder using this talent .
everything is fine and funny
until he comes across a childhood love 
anna friel
( goal !
the dream begins 
timeline )
and thing really get complicated .
he can not send her back
and he can never touch her .
boy 
would
that make a relationship difficult.i will be tuning in to see
where this series goes in the expectation
that it will continue to entertain .
