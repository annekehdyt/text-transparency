i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons.but now with season 5 ?
( or is it 6 ? )
thing are getting just plain too tiring.i
used to like the show ,
but its become donald trump own ego fest .
granted its his company you will be working for ,
but come on !
some of the thing says
`` you are fired ''
is just insulting.after watching the show ,
i would not want to work for him .
not because he is arrogant 
pompous or such .
its just
that the show is unrealistic and the way
he handles thing
makes me just squirm .
good entertainment ?
yes 
but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring.. its not team work 
its not personal 
its just business .
watch your back jack .
