i see what the director was trying to do
but he missed the mark .
the main actor was really good
but the editing around his moment takes you out of it .
the camera work 
ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur
which i could forgive
if the direction was more fluent
but it was not .
the sound was a bit off
and that takes you out of the film as well .
i see could see this director
doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off
but do not expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 day later or anything ,
keep your expectation low
and you will get more out of it .
at least it was only an hour and a half .
oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad
if you ask me .
but i am a movie snob so take
that for what that is worth .
