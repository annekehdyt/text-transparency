i first saw this film
when i was about 8 year old on tv in the uk
( where it was called `` laupta :
the flying island '' ) .
i absolutely loved it ,
and was heartoken
when it was repeated a while later and i missed it .
i was enchanted by the story and character 
but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music .
it would have been the original english dubbed version
which i saw -
sometimes erroneously referred to as the `` streamline dub ''
( the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline )
which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.unfortunately i feel
that the release has been partly spoiled by disney .
the voice acting is ok
but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy
that the `` streamline '' dub or the original japanese had ,
and i think
jame van der beek sounds too old
to play the lead .
they have made some pointless alteration ,
such as changing the main character 's name from `` pazu '' to `` patzu '' ,
and added some dialogue .
but worst of all i feel
that they have ruined many scene with intrusive music
- the opening scene of the airship for example was originally silent
but has been spoiled thank to disney 's moronic requirement
that there be music
playing
whenever anyone is not speaking ,
which i find annoying in many disney film.this film still blows away most recent animated film ,
and i can not recommend it highly enough .
the plot is simple yet captivating
and the film shows a flair
which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market 
homogenized animation .
