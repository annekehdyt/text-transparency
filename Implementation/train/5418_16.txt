i saw this film a while back
and it is still at the top of my 'favorite movie ' list .
it is amazingly put together
and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bit
( such as the 'cafe bustelo ' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandson hair )
that person are not seeing
because you will not understand this movie
unless you are hispanic .
this is just one of those film
that is very culturally specific and particular .
please do not bash this film
if you have no prior knowledge
of what foundation it is being built upon .
i completely see what the writer/director was going for ,
and he hit the target perfectly !
this film is highly deserving of a better rating .
