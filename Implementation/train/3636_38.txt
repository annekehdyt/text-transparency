this has to be one the best movie about serial killer
that i have ever seen ,
and this is coming from someone
who absolutely loved silence of the lambs .
hbo has hit the jackpot here .
this film is compelling from the first moment
until the last.this film has so many underlying theme its hard
to tell exactly
what it is about .
it chronicles the decade-long search for the russian serial killer andrea chikatilo .
stephen rea gives a illiantly reserved performance
as the inexperienced forensic expert
who is put in charge of the investigation ,
and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior ,
and the only person in the russian government willing to help him .
both of their performance are subtle masterpiece
-- -rea begin naive and unwilling to compromise ,
while sutherland begin detached and almost amused by the situation .
towards the end 
rea becomes more world-weary and beaten by the system ,
while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic.in any other movie ,
i would have said
that sutherland 's performance stands out above the rest ,
but here even it is rivaled by jeffrey dumann 
as the serial killer himself .
dumann illiantly creates a character here
who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think
we would find
-- -he is a monster ,
but he does not want to be ,
and we get the idea
that he is just as disgusted with what he does
as we are .
he is tortured 
ashamed ,
but vicious as well.if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter ,
( and it is *very* disturbing ) ,
then you should see this movie .
