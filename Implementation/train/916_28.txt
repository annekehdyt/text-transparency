hello .
i am paul raddick 
a.k.a .
panic attack of wtaf 
channel 29 in philadelphia .
let me tell you about this god awful movie
that powered on adam sandler 's film career but was digitized
after a short time.going overboard is about an aspiring comedian
played by sandler
who gets a job on a cruise ship and fail ...
or so i thought .
sandler encounter babe
that like history of the world part 1 and rebound .
the babe were supposed to be engaged 
but 
actually ,
they get executed by sawtooth ,
the meanest cannibal the world has ever known .
adam sandler fared bad in going overboard ,
but fared better in big daddy 
billy madison 
and jen leone 's favorite 
50 first date .
man 
drew barrymore was one hot chick .
spanglish is red hot ,
going overboard are not dooley squat !
end of file .
