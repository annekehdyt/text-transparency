when stanwyck 's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding ,
she retreats to a mountain lodge ,
where she slips
( sort of )
off a cliff
and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan .
morgan falls in love with her 
leading to a definitely one-sided marriage ,
spent on a huge estate in chicago
( which appears to be surrounded by mountain ! ) .
stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez ,
but eventually return to morgan ,
in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.this film has a great cast
( morgan in particular is one of my favorite ) and a great director ,
but the script is meandering
and seems pointless at time .
i was so ready
to enjoy this movie
but i was ultimately disappointed .
still worth watching for the cast ,
and it is good for anyone
who likes 1930s film .
