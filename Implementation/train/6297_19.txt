if you are used
to seeing gaiel byrne in serious role such as tom in miller crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend
you take a look at this film .
even if you are not a fan of gaiel byrne in particular ,
all the actor in this film give really great performance .
if you have got about eleven buck
( that is close to nine quid )
i say
order it online ,
or rent
it from you favorite movie rental place .
guaranteed
to make you laugh ,
whether or not you normally like gangster type movie .
mad dog time/trigger happy is one of those movie
you never forget ,
and find yourself watching over and over .
you will talk
about it so much your friend will be begging to borrow it .
