morgan fairchild is along for theride
as the mayor ... yes ,
she is the mayor.of course ,
you probably did not need a plot sketch
since the entirestory is in the title .
someone
named eric is taking revenge againstperson as a phantom of a mall .
this also means there is nosuspense .
we know
eric is behind this ,
but we still have to seeeste and cute girl go through the motion of a silly investigation.watch as fairchild ,
who
we know
has been in cahoot with themall owner all along ,
pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle ofa crowded party ,
yet no one says a word
as she leads them to heroffice 
and her eventual death .
the fictional town is huge ,
yet nary apoliceman is ever called ,
everyone rely on mall security for order.eric has been hiding
since the mall was built ,
but i am not surewhere .
he seems to live in a basement area ,
but you would thinksome construction worker would have found him .
he also hasfurnished his love pad quite well ,
and found a few outlet 
since hehas electricity .
it might be nicer than your own apartment !
pauly shore fan

take note .

yes ,
stop scanningceleity skin and playgirl ,
this is where you get to see a grainyblack and white shot of pauly 's south shore ,
although no weezil.this is just junk ,
and proof positive
that i am down to renting justabout anything at the video store
to stay in the horror section .

to watch it .
