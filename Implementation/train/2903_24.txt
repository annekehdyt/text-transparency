do not listen to the many acerbic and derisory comment heaped upon this film ... ..simply put ,
as regard ninja movie 
this my friend is about as good
as it gets !
yes it is silly ,
yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious ,
but by gum - it is so much bloody fun !
in fact ,
as is often the case with b-movie ,
the horrendous 'acting '
( which in the case of the movie in question ,
is truly amongst the worst i
have ever had the joy to behold ! )
and ridiculous 'plot ' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold.obviously
the fight scene are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i am pleased to say ,
they are very well choreographed 
especially the final showdown
( during which we witness
that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal law of gravity ... . )
trust me on this ,
if you are a fan of ninja movie
and you have not yet seen sakura killer ,
then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion 
one of the true jewel in the crown of the genre .
