allen goes to the country
( somewhere he hates going in real life )
and has a weekend with his friend -
which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching type
that feature in many of his films.i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedy ,
but here he really falls totally flat on his face .
even the one-liner seem to have deserted him .
the really is no plot
( bar bit and piece of cod shakespeare ) -
but allen seems to use the location
to allow a semi-mystical air ,
which just makes the thing even more witless and half-baked.it just does not work at any level
and is just a giant bore .
the best thing about this film
( apart from the end credit coming up )
is that the bad review seem to get him to wake up and realise
that simply throwing together a slapdash script
and casting your mate in it does not make for entertainment .
