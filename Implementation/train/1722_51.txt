the life of the saint starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy 
quaint street and sunshine .
i was hoping
it would maintain this atmosphere ,
but it gets bogged down in a story
that goes pretty much nowhere.othello work for big 
fat mr. karva 
his crime-boss step-dad
( at least i think
that is what he is supposed to be because it is never really defined ,
but he does drop kittens into deep fat frier ,
so trust me ,
he is a prick )
doing scrappy little errand
while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand-jobs .
one of his colleague is runner 
a black dude
who is always dashing from a to b. until the day
he comes across almost mute homeless child
who grants him his wish
of being able to stop running .
runner dumps the lost boy in othello 's flat ,
where he promptly starts granting more wish .
keen to have some of his own desire fulfilled ,
karva has the boy kidnapped .
but he is not sure of what would really ing him happiness .
is it the innocence of being a child again
or is it another hand-job ?
either way 
i do not want to see the little boy grant
him the second.it just takes age
to get going
and there are load of repetitive scene .
the ending try to be shocking
but since there is hardly any back-story on investment in any of these character
it only serves as a release for the bored audience.writer tony grisoni 
a favourite of terry gilliam 
try to blend in some kind of religious allegory
which ends up being pretentious as all hell 
ironically .
if he gave us something
more accessible or at least had better explanation for the character suddenly acting all weird then
it would have been a more enjoyable film .
as it is ,
we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouth
who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence
when confronted by the mysterious boy .
who 's origin are never revealed .
that is just plain irritating !
aside from sporadic moment of atmosphere and a moody score ,
this film has little to recommend .
