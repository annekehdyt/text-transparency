one scene demonstrates the mentality of `` terminator woman '' pretty well :
karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain 's camp .
karen runs across an armed guard ,
who points his gun at her ,
but after a few second throws it away
and challenges her to a fight .
karen kicks him in the ball ,
picks up the gun
and runs away !
then again ,
when a film is directed by a martial artist
and written /
produced by another member of his family ,
you know
you should not expect too much .
karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on ,
and the film might have turned out better
if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship .
but after about 20 minute they get separated ,
and the film slows to a crawl ,
and even with the occasional fight scene to liven thing up ,
it lacks excitement .
the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat ,
but the fight are intercut in a way
that eaks their flow and diminish their value .
on the positive side 
kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance
to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film !
