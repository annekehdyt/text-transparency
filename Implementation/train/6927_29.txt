ursula andress ' naked body is one of those thing
that make you believe in god .
the other two woman
( especially the one
who plays the maid )
have great body as well .
then why is the higher grade
that i can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3/10 ?
because ,
to get to ursula 's unbelievable body ,
we have to sit through a movie
that is otherwise unfunny and boring
( keep in mind
that i watched the full 101-minute version 
not the 78-minute american one
which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material ) .
in typical italian-comedy tradition 
most of the character are exaggerated caricature
( the army freak 
the `` latin lover '' 
the constant drunk 
the naive maid )
that are not funny ,
simply overacted .
final word :
watch this ,
but keep your finger on the fast-forward button ,
you are gon na need it .
