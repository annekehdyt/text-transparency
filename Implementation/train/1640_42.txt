ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel .
it is too easy .
so i am going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspect of little man .
first 
i am impressed with the special effect .
it really did look like marlon wayan ' head was attached to the body of a little person .
i never doubted it for a minute.secondly ,
i loved some of the unexpected cameos .
david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer ,
and his rendition of `` havin ' my baby '' and `` movin ' on up '' were priceless .
john witherspoon ,
who 
coincidentally ,
played grier 's father in 1992 's boomerang
( if you remember ,
he `` coordinated '' the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket )
now plays vanessa 's father in little man .
so that was fun.beyond that ,
this movie is about as believable as white chick .
how dumb is it
when even the doctor can not tell
that it is a 40-year-old man and not a baby ?
he is got a full set of teeth ! ! !
how is it possible that no one seems to notice
that it is not a baby ?
little man is so bad
that there is a rob schneider cameo .
and please ,
if you are stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie ,
at least do me a favor
and do not ing your child .
this movie is way too sexual for small child
( lot of joke and innuendo about sex ,
going down ,
eating out 
etc .
) ,
and i felt embarrassed for the parent
who ought their kid to the screening i
was forced to endure .
if you insist on seeing an idiotic film ,
as least spare your child the pain and suffering .
