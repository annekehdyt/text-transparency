first let me be honest .
i did not watch all this movie .
i watched the first five minute
and when i realized
that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided
that i may as well fast forward
and see
if it got any more interesting later on ...
it did not .
this film is just a collection of lame attempt
to make a story
which is already uninteresting
and badly told into something
that it would never become :
a decent horror movie .
because i feel
it is important to say
that even a movie with poor special effect can still be good
if it is well made .
this film is not and will only put you into a deep sleep
if you attempt to watch it .
lastly i feel
it is important to say
that i think
this movie is in the publicdomain so
if you feel
that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place
where you will not need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung .
