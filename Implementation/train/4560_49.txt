cut try to be like most post-scream slasher tried to be 
a spoof of the horror genre
that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movie .
now 
i am not bagging 'scream 
'
as i think
'scream ' is a very good horror movie
that does a great job of blending horror and comedy .
cut fails on most level .
it has its moment
but overall it just does not work out ,
not even as a `` so bad it is good '' movie ,
just a below average one.the first five minute or so are ok
and set the story fairly well ,
apart from the fact
that kylie minogue can not really act ,
and ironically she gets her tongue out ,
go figure .
go forward some time and a group of film student want to finish her film off ,
which is apparently cursed .
and ,
as you have probably predicted ,
one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.unoriginal plot ,
poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the element
that follow .
there is plenty of referencing in the film ,
everything from 'scream ' to 'the texas chain saw massacre . '
this is not smart either ,
it feels
as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool
by mentioning other famous horror flick ala scream .
for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity ,
which is a huge negative
when it comes to a slasher
that has not got a whole lot going for it .
really 
i should be supporting this movie
because i am australian and we are not as good
when it comes to horror
( we do have our gem 
though )
but cut is definitely not one of them.however ,
it did keep me watching for the 90 minute or so ,
so that is something good at least .
i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fan ,
who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for ,
but if you are looking for a good movie ,
stay away.2/5
