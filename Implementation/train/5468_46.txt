tobe hooper has made great movie
so i was certain this could not be bad .
i did not read any review
and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film .
at time this made me laugh ,
sometime i almost fell asleep ,
sometime made me almost cry for hooper.i rated this 3/10
because its 1990 `` horror '' -movie and many interesting or funny thing happened there .
throughout the movie i was thinking something
like `` they simply can not add more thing in this movie ... ''
..
but they did.some tell this is some sort of firestarter clone
but truly is not .
it is based on that idea but that all .
this is combination of horror 
comedy 
weird religion/god thing 
funny gore 
simple effect 
drama 
horrible acting 
unbelievable script..and more .
*spoilers* story is :
government try to create ultimate weapon
using nuclear power or something and fail ,
during process child is born for 2 test person .
when mom sing to her child after the birth 
both husband and wife burn
and it is spontaneous combustion .
government bury whole thing
and leaves this child live amongst other person and ...
then after x year this kid is grown up
and realizes he has been born for a reason
and whoa he can burn thing with his ain .
then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explain anything and .. well
when the government realizes `` okay now he can set this fire thing to work ''
they take him to normal hospital
where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man
because they could kill him ,
no they can not shoot him no !
.. and argh 
i guess
that enough to tell ,
i promise there is 100 more weird thing in this movie.well
if you want good laugh watch this one .
gosh .
