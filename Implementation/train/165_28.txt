i have not read this book ,
but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head :
this is so vonnegut .
i have never seen an author 
all of the intelligence and life behind the working of a novel 
translated so well to film .
this movie had the same complexity found in vonnegut 's novel :
the joke were often meaningful and symbolic ,
and the dramatic event and symbol were often also joke.campbell was also a very vonnegut character ,
portrayed perfectly by nick nolte .
he had all of the earmark of a vonnegut `` hero '' :
lack of concern for political boundary 
ironic dark humor
giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress ,
and an unwillingness
to push his version of reality on those around him.overall ,
i was constantly surprised
and impressed
as i watched this movie .
it was the same feeling i had reading `` cat 's cradle 
'' my first vonnegut novel ,
as if the most perfectly oddball thing
that could happen ,
he thought of that ,
and he made it real and important .
yes 
he has nothing but army surplus `` white christmas '' album .
so it goes !
