the good earth is not a great film by any mean ,
it is way to ordinary .
maybe it was different in the 1930 's
but who would want to see the life of a farmer .
it is not very interesting to me .
yes 
luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting
but the film dragged on way too long .
i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act .
in short wang lung
( muni )
a small time farmer
who does not want to be like his own father
turns out exactly like him .
both falling in love with their wife just as they are on their death bed .
the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next .
also this film did not have any good character actor or funny moment ,
it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis .
