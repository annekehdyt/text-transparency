i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movie not available to me in the store .
i chose the souler opposite
because i love christopher meloni ,
and also like small 
often ignored films.this one is such a treat !
meloni has such charm in this part .
it is easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler
( losvu ) .
in this film 
meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer
who is hitting the skid in many way ,
only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected.the relationship
drawn between barry
( meloni )
and tim busfield 's character is realistic and not over done .
i have not seen busfield since 30something ,
and he was fun to watch .
but it was all chris ' film .
i became such a fan girl
all over again.it is a bit slow in the beginning ,
i will admit .
i thought
some of the `` flashback '' could have been edited down .
but overall 
this film will delight you - male or female -
as it has an honest 
refreshing view of relationship today .
