someone mentioned editing .
this is edited badly
and what started out
as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess .
for starter 
let us know
what it is you
are trying to do with these experiment .
why are these person the best choice for the type of experimenting
they are involved in ?
and 
what exactly are they testing ?
apparently there is some grand plan
that some agency is going to exploit .
the acting is pretty bad .
everyone is emoting .
everyone is keeping secret .
they frequently mention
that
if it were not for the money ,
they had hang it up .
there is a deranged minister
who spouts scripture .
on and on .
but 
again 
the biggest hang up is the lack
of laying out a playing field for the actor .
there are some really cheesy element .
those little room and those chaise lounge .
the awful wallpaper
( was it wallpaper ? ) .
it was interesting ,
but did not seem to go anywhere .
