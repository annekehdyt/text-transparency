basically 
a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughter deal with infidelity .
the premise is interesting ,
the acting is good ,
and the music 
although sometimes aupt
and without direction ,
is pretty cool.the problem is the plot .
the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show
( she has a minor role )
and then walks back in to give her something ,
but sees her with another man .
the rest of the movie deal with his angst about this episode 
his visual hallucination and a macho alter-ego
( denis leary 
a former patient of his )
and his fear
in confronting his wife lest
he will have to `` do something about it . ''
i will not tell you the ending ,
but let me say
that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper .
the motivation of the character are missing :
why is she cheating on him ?
he is a dentist 
decent looking 
good father .
the film does not say .
who 's she doing it with ?
do not expect any answer on that either .
why does he want to keep the marriage going
in spite of all this ?
who knows .
what purpose does all the kid vomiting serve ?
where is this film going ?
good performance by campbell scott and hope davis
( and denis leary as comic relief )
are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense
which does not know
if it wants to be american beauty or a family film .
a root canal is more interesting .
avoid it .
