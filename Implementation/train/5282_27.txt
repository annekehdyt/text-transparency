this game is one of the best rpg .
fist 
it is actually more amusing than any other
because of the battle system
( you harm the enemy depending
on how you aim the attack ,
you can transform into dragoon 
the special attack 
the magic ... ) .
the script is very good .
character are all lovely
and you have no long dialog to support ,
as happened in several game of final fintasy series .
i got bored of that dialog about past ,
when you just want to go on with the game 's story .
ambientation is a jewel on this game ,
it combines middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction .
it is remarkable that animation effect are just incredible 
i like them more than other in other modern game
( we can not remember
that legend of the dragoon is 8 year now ) .
then 
map is huge ,
there are all kind of place an enemy .
finally 
music is not the best game muse i have heard ,
but it is perfect for a game like this .
