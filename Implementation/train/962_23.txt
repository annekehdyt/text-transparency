i think i read this someplace :
joe johnston
( director of the film
and also one of the guy
who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star war film ) and one of his producer or something were racking their ain for a title for the movie 
`` rocket boy ''
( i guess )
was lacking something.one day
they were messing with a pc program
that forms word from other word
( ie :
you type in a word or series of word
and it mixes the letter up and forms other word )
i think
the technical term is an `` anagram '' anyway ,
they typed in `` rocket boy ''
and sure enough what comes back is `` october sky '' .
they were shocked to say the least .
the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik .
at first homer jr did not like the idea ,
but he warmed up
to it after the `` movie poster paperback novel '' came out
and took off .
