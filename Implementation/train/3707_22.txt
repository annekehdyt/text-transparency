the great caruso displays the unique talent of mario lanza .
he shows great acting capacity
and is in top form as a lyrical singer 
paired with dorothy kirsten 
soprano of the metropolitan opera .
indeed 
i dare to say
that he performs some song better than caruso
( check a'vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini ) .
the mgm art and music department also did a good job .
this movie could be perfect ,
were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth ;
we see
that she is trying her best ,
dressed in the fifty style in scene
just before 1920 - unforgivable .
lanza deserved a better leading lady ,
and blyth should stick to less demanding production .
also notice
that ms. kirsten sing most of the opera duet of the film with lanza ,
giving the wrong notion
that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .
