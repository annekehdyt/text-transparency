this film was rather a disappointment .
after the very slow 
very intense
( and quite gory )
beginning the film begins to lose it .
too much plot leaves too little time for explanation ,
and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about .
the character remain shallow 
the story is not convincing at all ,
most of it is d\u00e9ja v\u00f9 stuff
without hint of parody ,
and there are some very cheesy part ... like ,
the young cop has to do dig up a body .
of course it is night
and it rains
and he has to do it alone ... yawn !
or the manifestation of the evil
being `` nazis '' plus `` genetic manipulation '' ... wow ,
that is really original .
there are some nice bit 
though 
like the fistfight scene 
mountain view and some
( running ) gags ,
but
( though reno and vincent cassel do what they can )
that is definitely not worth it .
( 3/10 )
