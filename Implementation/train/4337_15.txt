two warring shop worker in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweetheart
as they correspond under box-number alias .
within this simple idea and an everyday setting 
lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit 
drama 
poignancy and irony
that never lets up .
stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotion and tension ,
and the rest of the well-developed character have their own sub-plot and in-joke .
although wrongly eclipsed by stewart 's big film of 39/40
( destry 
philadelphia story 
mr smith )
this is easily on a par
and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlty unseen in the other film .
