this is a bad b movie masquerading as a mockumentary .
the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character .
that completely destroyed any `` documentary feel ''
that they may have wanted to create.the fact
that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of it is problem .
the film is not funny .
the film is not sexy .
the film does not have anything insightful to say about the porn business .
it is not even particularly salacious .
while there is simulated sex ,
the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated film.someday ,
someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry .
this is not it .
