john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie .
i felt
like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film .
anna farris was par for the course 
not good 
but not horrible
( plus she is cute ) .
dianne keaton should have known better .
jeff daniel was the only saving grace in this movie
( even though it was poor judgement on his part as well ) .
all in all 
i would avoid this at all cost .
i am just glad i did not pay to see it !
john heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of ' the dorky kid 
'
unless he does some serious work on his acting chop .
