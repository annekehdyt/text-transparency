this is a movie
that i can watch over and over
and never ever get tired of it ,
it has lot 's of laugh 
gun 
action 
crime 

good one liner 
and a decent plot 
with an over the top 
donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain .
tia carerra looks as hot
as she ever did
and can act too ,
thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character `` max '' a dea agent diane is the fbi agent ,
played by carerra ,
and john lithgow from frazier on tv ,
plays the bad guy 

`` livingston '' .
the plot center around max and diane trying to capture livingston
while they fight
and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agency ,
throw into the mix the assassain sutherland ,
who pretty much has all the good one liner ,
this is the perfect crime caper ,
there is the usual love story 
,
but played very differently
than you would think by carerra and griffith .
you also have the russian mafia 
italian mafia ,
and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix 
,
the film is shot in boston 
,
where you have some great shot ,
and local 

great photography and music in this film ,
this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy 
,
it has everything that one could ever want .
check out sutherland 's toilet in a particular scene 

very unusual .
this film is a riot
and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me .
