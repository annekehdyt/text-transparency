i am not usually a fan of strictly romantic movie
but heard this was good .
i was stunned .
easily the most romantic thing i have ever seen in my life .
stunning .
brilliant 
sweet 
funny and full of heart .
the chemistry is flawless
as is the writing and directing.ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural
and sweet together you really think
they are a couple .
the movie grabs you right away
and does not let go .
you can not look away nor can you stop
listening to them .
even the little moment just melt your heart .
this has jumped into the rank of one of my favourite ever .
a masterpiece .
