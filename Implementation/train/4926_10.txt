as i was watching this film on video last night ,
i kept getting these tingle
that told me this one will endure .
i have a feeling
i will be watching this again
and again for year to come.it is got all the timeless quality
you could ask for in a story/film .
and even though some cultural reference are obscure for me ,
a western viewer 
at the core this is a universal tale .
