this movie was a littttle confusing at first .
i usually like gina phillip ,
but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie ,
that one also not one her good movie .
jeeper creeper was way better .
anyway 
faye dunaway was good .
she totally creeped me out and at the end ,
that was crazy .
it was about jennifer cassi
( phillip )
who comes to her twin sister funeral .
she stays at a house
that her sister owns and her grandmother
( dunaway )
lives at with an aunt
named emma .
mary ellen
( dunaway )
is kinda sacrificing her relation
to stay alive
and as long as she wants to live ,
she can not die .
even if jennifer tries to kill her ,
which she tries .
raven have a weird part in it .
when the relation go to sleep ,
the raven eat there organ ,
so they can not go to sleep .
but they do .
basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die
and her relation will be buried ,
but not dead 
b/c they have to suffer forever
so mary ellen can stay alive .
yeah 
i hope this helps .
if it does not 
sorry .
love ya .
