for the knowledgeable beatle fan 
the main value in this movie is to just sit back
and pick out the flaw 
inaccuracy ,
combined event 
omitted event ,
wildly exaggerated event ,
omitted person 
timeline error 
mis-attribute quote 
incorrect clothing 
out of place song ,
and
( shame shame )
incorrect instrument and other boner i just can not think of right now .
the flaw come fast
and furious so you will have to be on your toes.i did not give this a `` 1 '' primarily due the fact
that it is filmed in liverpool and the actor
( the band rain )
give it their all
( the lennon character is credible
and does a good job ) .
also 
the song `` cry for a shadow '' is heard at one point
and that count for something.so 

,
watch it for fun ,
but please do not take it as historically accurate .
