what was franco zeffirelli thinking ?
was hollywood responsible for this travesty ,
or can i take comfort in the idea
that someone
who did not speak english as a first language
just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte 's classic ?
i do not think
i can improve on a comment i read below ,
so i will just paraphrase it :
`` jane eyre is a great great book ,
the screenwriter should read it sometime . ''
it is true that this movie 's two lead were sadly miscast .
but pity the actor ,
because the screenwriter left out all of the best scene .
the dialog
that makes you understand
the jane and rochester have a meeting of mind and a shared sense of fun ...
deleted from the script .
the marriage proposal 
the fortune teller ... gone .
the allusion 
half joking 
half sincerely felt ,
to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair ...
eliminated.it is unfortunate
that zeffirelli felt the need
to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane 's interaction with the river family .
but it is unforgivable
that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love story
ever written.do
yourself a favor
and go find the 1983
( ? )
mini series with timothy dalton .
