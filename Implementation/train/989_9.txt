a strange mix of traditional-80 
smartassy 
chevy chase-type 
`` every-ten-lines-you-get-a-funny-one '' farce and sickie black comedy .
mildly amusing in spot 
but utterly tasteless .
there is a skiing sequence
that includes the fakest-looking back-projection since `` on her majesty 's secret service '' .
