had some lovely poetic bit
but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution .
how do these person get through film school ?
who gives them money
to make this crap ?
could have been so much more 
fine lead actor ,
and i always like fairuza balk ,
but come on ,
the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacan notly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired ,
and it sure does not make for good film .
the director needs to go away and live life for a good long
while and not come back to the camera
until
they really have something to say .
this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making ,
just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery
and hope hope hope like hell
that poetry emerge .
that can work ,
if the director actually has any kind of vision ,
or has a ain
that knows
when it is in the presence of potential ,
but here it is just space filler 
of no consequence .
i felt the lazy
ending coming moment
before it hit ,
and was yelling
`` you lazy bastard '' at the screen
when the credit popped up .
