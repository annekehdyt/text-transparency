i was quite a fan of the series as a child
and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoon
that made a difference in the early 80s
compared to previous animated series
( heidi 
barbapapa 
il etait une fois l'homme ... ,
most of which i love ) .
i find
that other similar japanese cartoon of this kind released later can not match mazinger z ,
as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.that very thing ,
the novelty 
may be one of the best feature of mazinger z. another good point is its inventiveness 
with so many extravagant monster 
strange device and bizarre character ;
actually 
we were eager to see each new installment
to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us !
