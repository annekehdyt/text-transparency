george p. cosmatos ' `` rambo :
first blood part ii '' is pure wish-fulfillment .
the united state clearly did not win the war in vietnam .
they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable
and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldier .
the only bad guy were the leader of the nation ,
who made this war happen .
the character of rambo is perfect to notice this .
he is extremely patriotic 
bemoan
that us-american did not appreciate and celeate the achievement of the single soldier ,
but has nothing but distrust for leading officer and politician .
like every film
that defends the war
( e.g .
`` we were soldier '' )
also this one avoids the need
to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia .
and for that matter also the reason for every single us-american soldier
that was there .
instead 
rambo gets to take revenge for the wound of a whole nation .
it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memory 
rather than suppressing them .
`` do we get to win this time ? ''
yes 
you do .
