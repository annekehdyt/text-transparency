i saw this film
when it first came out in 1978 ,
when i was a sophomore in high school .
i took a date
to see it .
i did not `` get any 
'' needless to say ,
because the film was so bad !
joan river ' career never tanked as badly as it deserved
after making this awful 
unfunny crap .
in fact 
unfunny is not a severe enough term :
this film is anti-funny !
you walk out feeling like any laughter
that might have occurred
was beaten out of you
before it could happen .
this is not worth watching out of curiosity 
or out of any sense
of it being `` so-bad-it is-good . ''
not even the gang at mst3k could have made this worth watching !
the fact
that billy crystal 's career survived this early suicide
attempt is a miracle .
