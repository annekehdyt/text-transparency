thank to the bbc for this show .
i used to suffer from an inferiority complex ,
i hated leaving the house ,
talking to new person and i had an overwhelming sense
that person hated me .
however
after watching one episode of 4 non blonde my fortune
started to change .
after episode 2 i started applying for new job ,
wearing fashionable clothe and i actually felt talented .
when the series had finished i was running the sale department at work 
banging a plethora of woman and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local .
if you ever have a confidence crisis
and do not know
where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd
it is only 99p .
