it is hard to say
what was the worst thing about this show :
the bad acting 
poor acoustic of different portion 
bad cgi 
improper set for the period 
the poor script .
it would have been nice
if the script followed the original tale a bit closer
-- there is enough tension and good material in beowulf
to provide a great deal of good material 
and a better story line ,
than the scriptwriter could come up with.and
why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow
that fires explosive bolt ?
i see
that this movie was made in `` only '' 21 day .
it shows in the lack of quality .
i am beginning to think
this is general
( poor ) attitude
taken by sci-fi channel
( and other )
when it comes to making movie out of classic tale in the past few years.what a waste !
