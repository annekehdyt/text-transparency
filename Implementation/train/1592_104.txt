this is one of those horror flick
where twenty-something fool around with the dark art around a camp fire ,
getting into a heap of trouble
for doing so .
a portal was opened containing a world of demon
known as the kelippoth of the sitra achra by a man
whose daughter 
summer ,
gets kidnapped by something ,
taken into it .
summer is trained by a mysterious group
whose identity are never revealed to battle the demon monster .
this is a portion of the plot
which lends itself to scrutiny .
anyway 
three wannabee witch ,
who went to high school together 
renea 
the most enthusiastic 
serious practitioner in the dark art 
and her lesbian cohort 
jasmine and marlene
( ..it is more or less a passing fad with them 
though.. )
join up with buddy 
jason and ricky 
on a trip in the wilderness
where summer vanished from her home ten year ago .
opening the portal through a spoken text
written in an ancient book ,
a demon is set free 
as is summer 
now a warrior babe
whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skill
that have been needed to ward off monster in the other world.low budget
contains a loopy ,
but ambitious story ,
restraining it into a confined setting .
these young adult spend a lot of time
running around in the wood hoping
not to be fodder for a beast .
as can be the case in these movie ,
the demon stands on the sideline
while the story develops as summer attempt
to remember
how everything came to pass ,
while befriending jason
who wishes to help her restore the lost time .
the action is shot mostly in the dark ,
making any violence hard to decipher .
brigitte kingsley
( and the rest of the female cast for that matter ) ,
is some mighty nice eye candy ,
dressed scan notily clad as a female conan 
a gorgeous body
we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment
she appears until the closing of the movie .
some lesbianism
( ..some kissing and fondling )
and nudity spice thing up nicely ,
and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it is so preposterous
that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.might be of interest for co-starring world wrestling entertainment 's `` captain courageous '' christian
( real name 
jason reso )
as one of the group 
spoofing his alter ego 
as a chicken 
quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig .
landy cannon is likable as unlikely hero 
jason 
a lovestruck 
naive young man
whose ex-fianc\u00e9 
jasmine
( vanessa jame )
is now bi-sexual and in love with marlene
( ..jasmine 's cruelty is in toying with jason 's feeling by hiding her affair with marlene from his knowledge ) ,
while ricky and renea attempt to steer him away from this idea
that he can rekindle a dead flame
that gone out ,
never to ignite again .
the kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit ,
i guess to refrain from showing
how ludicrous/laughable it looks
if presented in full .
the lesbian antic of jasmine and marlene
( haley shannon )
is mostly tame 
their love making ,
once alone in the wood up against a tree ,
is toned down
and also lighted using the blackness of night .
my rating is a bit favorable toward it ,
almost solely because of kingsley 
for purely superficial reason 
rather than the plot or film-making .
the movie aims to please
and is marketed to the boy
( and girl
who love hot woman ) .
i think ,
though 
for the most part 
the humor falls a bit flat .
