the bad news is it is still really dreadful .
i gave it a 2
because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny.it is supposed to be better than `` mulva 
zombie ass kicker '' ,
and progress should be rewarded .
or maybe i was drinking heavily
when i watched it and felt generous .
whatever 
`` 2 '' it is.maybe the best thing
about this movie is that it is over pretty quick .
it takes element from most of kill bill i and ii 's key theme and fight scene ,
hack them up ,
dumbs them way down 
dirties up the dialog ,
and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.you would best smoke a lot of something powerful
if you want to enjoy this one .
and get this dvd back to the video store on time !
you will really hate yourself
if you have to pay a late fee .
