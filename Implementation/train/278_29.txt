this movie has always been my favorit disney movie .
then on 11/21/01 i saw the 30th aniversy of this movie dvd .
wow i remembered
why i loved this movie .
the dvd is so great ,
it has an extra 30 min
that the original did not have .
i did not know this
when i first started watching .
the movie made ever so much more since .
the music
they cut out should
have been left in .
you have not seen this movie
until you have seen the full 131 min version .
a lot of person say
that the music is forgettable .
i remember every song in this movie by heart ,
every song has it is own charm
by it is self ,
and comes together as a hole .
i remember
when i was younger i had the `` eglantine '' song stuck in my head for day at a time .
as well as `` briny sea ''
( that song was meant for marry poppen
but was cut out of the film )
please watch the new uncut 30th aniversy movie and re-vote for this movie .
the 10
that it really is .
