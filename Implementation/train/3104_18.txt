just saw this movie version of frank loesser 's guy and doll for the third time with my mother
who had never seen this before .
she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voice of jean simmon and marlon brando .
and she thought
the havana sequences where simmon and brando dance up a storm were excellent .
those were pretty impressive to me too
and were usually the highlight of the film .
directed by joseph l. mankiewicz 
this movie
which originated as a story by damon runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non-musical scene at first
but pulls you in after a while .
the other story with frank sinatra and vivian blaine was not as compelling to me
but still had their charm especially during the `` sue me '' number .
also loved stubby kaye 's `` sit down ,
you are rocking the boat '' number and the performance of sheldon leonard and b. s. pully .
with a theatrical look throughout 
guy and doll is not a great film musical
but certainly a very good one .
