i found this movie boring 
monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried 
shallow `` upbeat '' ending
that did not ring true to the overall story .
following these character through a weekend of awful event ,
unfriendly attitude and bad news just is not my idea of a watchable ,
interesting movie and i got very tired of its `` one note '' theme
and could not wait for it to end
-- in fact i almost stopped about halfway through .
the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering ,
and the character were for the most part depressing and unpleasant ,
though the acting was good .
a small movie with small ambition and small appeal
-- sorry ,
but it just did not make it with me 
and i love good 
small film !
this one just did not jell ,
though i kept watching it hoping and trusting
that it would .
i was disappointed ,
especially after two local reviewer put it on their `` year 's 10 best '' list .
i would strongly recommend watching `` the house of sand ''
instead
-- now there is a good 
small film !
