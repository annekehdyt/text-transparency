spoiler ! ! !
this movie is based on the concept
of what if ?
of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question .
the main character goes through a bad day 
like many of us ,
and asks this question .
chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction .
the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game .
this event sets into motion one 's destiny ;
just like ashton in `` the butterfly effect ''
except mr. destiny uses comedy over drama .
the result make a fresh 
somewhat original movie .
if one 's philosophical are in tune with `` the butterfly effect ''
one will likely enjoy mr. destiny .
i give it a 7/10 .
amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie 3 time ,
and finally watched the ending on tbs .
