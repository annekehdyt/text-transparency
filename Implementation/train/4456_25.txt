one :
richard pryor and jackie gleason 
two great comic turned into sap for a atty kid .
they have both sold themselves out in this one 
worse than pryor 's character .
two : horrible 
overly sentimental script
that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched .
three :
choice of a black actor as the toy ; the racial subtext of this is unbearable ,
as its never addressed .
there is no message here ,
pryor 's part could have been played by any comedic actor .
four :
that kid ... i wish
i could go back in time
and prevent him from ever acting ...
that would mean movie like this one and kid co. might not have been made ...
and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power .
so if you want to watch a couple of great comic defile
themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick ,
go ahead .
if you want to see them in something good ,
see pryor 's old standup act and gleason in something better 
like the honeymooner .
