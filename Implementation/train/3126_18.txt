my wife and i just finished watching b\u00fbsu aka the booth .
she fell asleep during some part of the movie .
i really wish
i had taken a snooze with her ,
but the unfortunate fact is that the main character 's voice is so loud and grating
that it was impossible for me to sleep .
when our protagonist speaks ,
it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke .
he also has no redeeming quality .
i was hoping
he had get hit by a bus five minute into the film.do not get me wrong 
i love asian horror cinema ,
but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scene
that really make no damned sense at all .
if you want some good asian cinema ,
check out a tale of two sister or into the mirror .
avoid the booth like the plague ,
especially if you suffer from frequent migraine .
