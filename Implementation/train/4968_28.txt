i like chris rock ,
but i feel
he is wasted in this film .
the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine ,
but the filmmaker followed the plot of that turkey too closely .
when eddie murphy remade dr. doolittle and the nutty professor ,
he re-did them totally
-- so they became murphy film/vehicle 
not just tepid remake .
that is why they were successful .
if chris had done the same ,
this could have been a much better film .
the few laugh
that come are
when he is doing his standup routine
-- so he might as well have done a concert film .
it also would have been much funnier
if the white man
whose body
he inhabits
was a truck driver or hillbilly .
so why does hollywood keep making junk like this ?
because person go to see it
-- because they like chris rock .
so give chris a decent script
and give us better movie !
do not remake film
that were not that good in the first place !
