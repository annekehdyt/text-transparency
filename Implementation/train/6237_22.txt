writing something
genuine and true is challenging .
knowing how to shoot it
and putting it together
without making it trivial is even better .
ishai setton 's movie is one of those
where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty .
i have been touched by `` the big bad swim ''
and from now on 
i will promote it as far as i can .
it is just a shame
that i can not have something to show to my friend
( you know 
such as a dvd ? ? ?
) ,
because talking is good ...
but giving something to see
is better .
everyone can not go to festival
to discover pearl like that and this movie 's really worth to be put out there !
a big thank you to the staff of this master piece ,
and i am waiting for it to be distributed .
