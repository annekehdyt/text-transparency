`` hatred of a minute '' is arguably one of the better film
to come out of michigan in recent year .
not to say
that it is a illiant film by any mean ,
but it is definitely worth a watch .
`` hatred '' chronicles the sordid adventure of eric seaver
( played by director kallio ) ,
a formerly abused child now grown up ,
and starting to listen to his evil side .
`` hatred '' is very nice visually .
the shot are creative ,
and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at .
this film actually has an element of production value to it ,
unlike other recent michigan releases like `` dark tomorrow '' and `` biker zombie . ''
subtle dolly shot and stylized shot composition show good use of this film 's $ 350,000 budget .
however 
`` hatred '' stumble in the same place
that so many other local film do ,
and that is in the story and character department .
essentially 
thing just kind-of happen .
eric seaver does not evolve at all .
basically 
he is always been crazy ,
it is just that person are starting to notice .
the film just wander along its merry way with very little development .
also 
the ending is very aupt .
however- since this is a horror film ,
since when do we care about plot ?
we just want to see person die ,
and `` hatred '' certainly delivers .
as the body count mounted ,
person in the theater started cheering `` kill her !
kill em ' all ! ''
when person scream back at the screen ,
it is always fun .
that is the place where `` hatred '' succeeds .
it is fun .
and in the end 
that is all
that really matter .
