the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man 
but with violence and some nudity .
i know
this film is a bit crummy
but i found
it impossible not to kind of like it.the acting and script
are not the best .
but the effect are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $ 50 -
the title character takes quite a while to actually melt
but when he does it is reasonably impressive ;
we also have one inventive death scene
involving electrocution .
of note too is the music ,
it is insane - a cheese-tastic medley of nonsense.notable highlight :
* marvel at the slow-motion nurse
who jumps through a pane of glass
for absolutely no reason whatsoever .
* be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head .
* beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid .
called steve .
* be astonished
when our hero takes a eak from hunting the melting lunatic
to have a bowl of soup
and complain about insufficient cracker in the kitchen.this film is just too 70 's for me to hate it .
it is tacky and trashy
but i thought
it was a lot of fun .
you could do a lot worse .
