the movie actually has a fairly good story ,
but gets bogged down in several key place .
it is almost as if the director threw the movie together
without taking the time
to make some essential cut in the film .
dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role ...
but something is clearly missing from several key scenes.thi 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie .
and probably would have been a much better
film had it not had the feel
as if it was thrown together .
