it is fitting on a musical sunday
to get your heart a pumping ,
and no one can do that better than little richard .
the man could sing the drawer off the lady and defined rock and roll.look to leon to provide a definitive characterization ,
as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptation and jackie wilson in mr. rock 'n ' roll :
the alan freed story.this was a fascinating biopic
as we saw little richard struggle with his father 
with his church and with himself over just who he was .
he won the battle
and there is no one else
that has his voice or his style .
