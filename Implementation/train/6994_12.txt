when i rented this i was hoping for what `` reign of fire '' did not deliver :
a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.instead i got a standard `` monster hunt stupid person in remote building '' flick 
with bad script 
bad music 
bad effect 
bad plot 
bad acting .
bad 
bad 
bad.only reason
why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movie .
in theory ... ..
