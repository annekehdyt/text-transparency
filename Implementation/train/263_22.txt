a lot of the problem many person
have with this movie
is that they seem to think
that the story should have been more entertaining
( ignoring
it is based on a true story )
or ranting against a film
that glorifies che
( which it really does not ) .
this film is very close to jon anderson 's definitive bio on che
and gets the story right .
soderburgh does an excellent job
of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle
that was che
is bolivian adventure .
you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewildermant of the bolvian peasant to che is revolutionary idea or of the difficulty
that his man faced with hunger and the terrain .
sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there
but that was how it happened .
so do not go into this movie
expecting a rambo shoot em up 
its a true story !
