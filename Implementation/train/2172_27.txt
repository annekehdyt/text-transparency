i was very moved by the story
and
because i am going through something similar with my own parent ,
i really connected .
it is so easy to forget
that someone whose body is failing was once viant and passionate .
and then there is the mistake
they made
and have to live with .
i loved ellen burstyn 's performance
and who is christine horne ?
she is fantastic !
a real find .
there is probably the most erotic scene i have ever seen in a film ,
yet nothing was shown -
it was just so beautifully done .
overall the look
and feel of the film was stunning 
a real emotional journey .
cole hauser is very very good in this picture ,
he humanizes a man spiraling downward .
i liked the way
the filmmaker approached this woman 's life ,
never sentimental 
never too much - just enough
to hook us in ,
but not enough to bog down .
