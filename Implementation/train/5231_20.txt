first of all
that i would like to say
is that edison chen is extremely hot
and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd !
this is probably one of the most original movie i
have seen so far ;
shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian .
the cambodian
( edison aka pang )
goes around killing person to survive himself ;
has done it throughout his entire life .
sam lee 's
( wai )
duty is to capture the cambodian for good .
there are ton of violent action
but has a good story to it .
the movie shows the struggle between those two character ;
they both beat each other like angry dog .
go and watch ppl ... strongly suggessted ! ! !
( go hk film )
