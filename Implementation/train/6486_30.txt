this movie was made-for-tv ,
so taking that into account ,
i am not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film .
the script is sub-par ,
but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spot ,
whether it means to be or not .
the acting is mostly over-the-top ,
but that is true for many lower-budget movie.the aspect of this movie
that i really hated 
though ,
was that 90-95 % of it is shot on film ,
but in random place 
there will be 5-10 second
where the footage is shot on video .
you can tell
because there is less contrast ,
the color are less vivid ,
and the footage is clearly 30 frame per second instead of film 's 24 frame per second .
i am not sure
if maybe these scene had to be shot later
and at that time they did not have the money
to shoot on film
( i assume this is why 
anyway ) ,
but it is disorienting
and really makes the film look shoddier
than it had to look.anyway ,
i have definitely seen worse movie ,
but i definitely would not say
that i enjoyed this movie and i can not recommend that anyone see it .
