this film was not nearly as much of a chore
as i expected it to be .
there are a few second of illiance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore ufo conspiracy paranoia-fest .
most of the acting is mediocre 
but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pause .
a photographer and a model witness some strange going-on in the wood and soon fall victim to these same going-on .
flying saucer are spotted ,
more person disappear -
but is it the alien or our own government 's ultra-secret group of cover-up guy ?
soon enough 
a reporter and a `` ufologist ''
( apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director )
are drawn into this unraveling fiasco
and become the target of the ultra-secret agent
who are as menacing
as they are improbable and witless .
then the fun really begins.the movie 
predictably ,
makes about as much sense as the average ufo conspiracy theory ,
but should be commended for taking itself so seriously .
the camera work is ok for a low-budget film ,
the pacing is pretty good ,
the script is silly and absurd ,
and there are continuity issue
which are fun
to look out for .
what are the few second of illiance i mentioned ?
honestly 
i can not say much you
without writing a spoiler .
suffice to say
that the end of the film is 
at least 
worth fast-forwarding
to if you can not take the middle .
