so far after week two of `` the lone of beauty '' i am a little disappointed.some of the acting is good ,
as long as we
except that it is only drama.i am unsure how person can feel
that this fictional drama is `` factual '' coverage of the `` thatcher '' year -
it is okay as drama ,
but i feel
the award winning book is still much better.i wonder
if the bbc will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the year
that follow with `` thing can only get better ''
finishing with 2006 and the fact
that we are still waiting !
with that promise from a government
that is full of sleaze .
