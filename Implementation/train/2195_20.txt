i saw `` fever pitch '' sort of by accident ;
it was playing on the airplane going over to europe .
it actually was not half bad .
ben
( jimmy fallon )
is the world 's # 1 red sox fan 
but his relationship with lindsay meek
( drew barrymore )
may strain that .
the movie is a fairly interesting look
at how world event can affect people ' relationship .
it is especially eye-opening now
that the red sox have ended their 80-odd-year losing streak .
i guess
that these sort of thing happen all the time
and we just do not tend to notice them .
not too bad.another movie
portraying an unusual relation to baseball
is 2000 's `` frequency '' .
check them both out .
