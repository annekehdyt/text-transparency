i can not understand what it is that fan of the genre did not like about this film .
it was truly a lot of fun .
the special effect were wonderful .
i generally agree with review and with imdb voter 
but not this time .
i waited
until it came to home video
which i felt was another reason
that i would not enjoy the film .
i believe
special effect film need to be seen on the big screen ,
but again this was not the case .
to me the film begs comparison to two film
that were released around the same time .
blair witch and the mummy .
both film
that i thought were terrible .
blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time .
the mummy made gobs of money
and it was pure dreck .
person liked it for it is special effect .
film like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development ,
they are more like funhouse ride .
well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting 's e-ticket .
