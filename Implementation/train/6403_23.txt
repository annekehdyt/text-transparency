this is one of my two or three favorite stooge short ,
and undoubtedly christine mcintyre 's best performance with the trio .
she is good in a number of other short ,
but here she is absolutely illiant .
her singing is not funny at all ,
in fact it is downright beautiful ,
but the plot is constructed in such a way
that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it .
we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three time ,
but it never gets old ,
partly because we do not tire of her voice ,
and partly because it blends so well with the stooge ' antic .
the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle 's role in the marx brother ' `` a night at the opera 
''
but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in `` opera 
''
and mcintyre
( perhaps more in other performance than here )
exhibited a comedic talent of her own
that carlisle never did .
the stooge ' buffoonery 
mcintyre 's singing 
and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 star .
