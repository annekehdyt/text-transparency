this is one of the worst film ever .
i like cheesy movie but this is simply awful .
where are the image in the film
that are on the box ?
i think
more money was spent on the dvd box illustration than on the entire film .
why would a company release a dvd
that the cover is so misleading ?
i feel
like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box .
as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research
and made a list
prior to visiting my local video rental store .
i have no one to blame except myself .
i want my money and time back .
do not watch this movie .
even if curiosity is motivating you 
stick cocktail umella in your eye instead .
it will be much more enjoyable .
you have been warned !
