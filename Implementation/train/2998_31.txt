jafar panahi 's comedy-drama `` offside '' portrays some woman
trying to enter a tehran sport arena from which woman
are banned .
the official reason :
lot of foul language ,
and the soccer player have their leg showing .
but of course 
it is really a case of sexism .
so 
most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the woman try
to ask the man serious question
about why woman are banned from the stadium ,
and one woman even comes up with her own scheme
to defy the man.as i understand ,
all of jafar panahi 's movie
( this one included )
are banned in iran .
the real tragedy is that the cia 's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the utal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse
to use his narrow interpretation of the koran
to establish a chauvinistic society ,
and that george w. bush 's current policy toward iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse
to act the cowboy
and tighten censorship.above all ,
this is a neat look at person coming up with way
to challenge the system .
not a great movie ,
but worth seeing .
considering
that all jafar panahi 's movie are banned ,
i wonder
how he is able to even make them .
