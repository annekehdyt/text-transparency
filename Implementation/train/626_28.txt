i have a lot of time for all the columbo film ,
but this one in particular was extremely well written ,
and the solution at the end very effective .
however 
my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film 
between columbo and the murderer
( i apologise
if i have not remembered every detail of this exactly ) .
it is the most striking image of columbo i
have seen :
the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard
where the victim was murdered ,
and into the room beyond ,
which is lit up by daylight .
columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair
facing the doorway
( and us ) ,
contemplating the cupboard ,
and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light .
there is no sound .
the camera slowly moves out of the room
and up toward him .
he is deep in meditation ,
puffing gently on a cigar 
swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upward
as he thinks .
then the dialogue starts .
superb .
