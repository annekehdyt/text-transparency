director sam fuller has something of a cult following 
particularly in europe .
yet the bulk of his film are more than forgettable .
he did however direct one really terrific movie in `` pickup on south street '' .
made pretty early on in his career ,
the movie
that followed were vastly inferior.from the first to the last frame ,
`` pickup '' work on all level .
it is filmed with flawless fluidity 
boasting fine performance all round .
richard widmark and thelma ritter both player with a fine record of top notch performance ,
are at their peak .
widmark ,
who was no stranger at playing villain ,
while truly mean to the core ,
still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity
which makes his character fascinating as well
as making jean peter character 's falling for him all the more credible.fuller holds no punch in this genuinely tough movie .
there is a scene
in which jean peter get roughed up by widmark .
it is truly shocking in its reality .
this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography.less self conscious
than many film noir 's of the period this remains a great example of the genre .
