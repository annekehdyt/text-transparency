almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china .
there are no fancy set 
explosion or glamorous person
-- only fine writing 
acting and direction
( hollywood ,
take note !
) .an estranged son return home
when he believes
his father is dying .
he is surprised to see
that dad look fine
and is going about running the family business as usual .
in fact 
he notices
that his father and his retarded other have really forged a close and caring relationship
and it soon becomes obvious
that he is out of the loop !
dad is very traditional
and this visiting son is from the big city
and does not really see the value of the old bathhouse .
how their relationship change
and where the plot goes from there
is exceptional
and believable.i was happy to see
that not every chinese movie is an action picture
( such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger ,
hidden dragon ) ,
as i do not particularly care for these frenetic film .
the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful example of good chinese film about person !
