big splashy film of the broadway music .
nathan
( frank sinatra )
loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap game .
blonde loving adelaide
( vivian blaine )
wants to marry him
if he gives up crap .
he decides on one last game
when sky masterson
( marlon brando !
) ,
who bets big ,
is in town .
he bets sky
that he can not get mission worker sarah brown
( jean simmon )
to go with him to havana .
that may sound like a strange plot summary
but so is the movie !
this is a real mixed bag
-- there is some wonderful stuff here .
the song are all good
and the dancing is incredible .
the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end .
also brando is really quite good here
-- it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing
but he pulls it off .
i have to admit seeing big 
bulky brando
pulling off some difficult dance move
was a lot of fun !
also sinatra is pretty good
and blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend .
her song and dance number are definite highlight here.now for the bad part
-- jean simmon is a wonderful actress
but she is stuck with a drab colorless role
and can not do much with it .
the movie is far too long at 150 minute
-- the scene between brando and simmon really drag
and should have been shortened .
also most of the character speak in very precise english
-- contraction are never used .
maybe it is trying to be amusing coming out of the mouth of gangster
but i found it jarring
and it kept throwing me out of the movie.it is worth catching for the song and dance
but the over length of it does get to you after a while .
i give it a 7 .
