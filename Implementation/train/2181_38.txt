this movie is ridiculous !
that is exactly what i like about this piece of `` guilty pleasure '' .
it is easy to condemn this movie
for not including pat priest and butch patrick 
the original marilyn and eddie .
but look at the year
and do the math .
pat priest and butch patrick had long outgrown their part !
time does that to young star .
yvonne de carlo ,
who re-prised her role as lili ,
was pushing the big 6-0
( even though she still looked good
and was still the perfect `` lili '' )
.it is a shame
that yvonne de carlo was not given a larger part .
still 
it was good to see fred gwynne and al lewis in the role
that made them so famous !
during the 2 season
that the munster was on prime time ,
it was the gwynne/lewis chemistry
that made the series such a success .
the rest of the cast were supporting cast member ,
not to say
that they were not needed .
they were !
the tv series would not had survived as long
as it did
without them .
given the choice between butch patrick or happy derman
( the original `` eddie '' ) ,
the choice was too easy .
yvonne de carlo was also the better choice
over joan marshall.though this movie does not measure up to the original tv series ,
it still measures up nicely
and is one of the better `` reunuin '' tv special
that plagued the boob-tube during the late 1970s/early 1980s . '
