this is definitely one of the best movie i
have ever seen
-- it has everything --
a genuinely touching screenplay 
fine actor
that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch ,
an actually elegant romance
( it is a shame
that
that kind of romance just does not seem to exist anymore ) ,
lovely song and lyric
( especially the final song ) ,
an artistic score 
and costume and set
that make you want to live in them .
the ending was only a disappointment
in that i was expecting a spectacular film
to have a illiant end
-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movie out there .
definitely check this movie out
-- over and over again .
there are many detail
you miss the first time
that deserve a second look .
