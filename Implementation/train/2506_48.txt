being a slasher film aficionado ,
i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie
that passes over my retina ,
which sometime does more harm than good to my ain ,
i will say .
while channel surfing the other night ,
sleepaway camp ii happened to cross path with me .
of course 
i wanted to check it out ,
as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise ,
but have never actually seen any of them
( for shame 
i know ) .
i will note
that
since i have not seen the original ,
my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously ,
because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise 's own design.now i am
assuming
that the franchise of sleepaway camp is 
in itself 
a joke on itself .
hell 
even the name comes off as an intentional joke .
sleep away camp ?
it is good fun .
i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value ,
but that is about as far as i can go .
the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday
the 13th look
like thespian doing a rendition of macbeth .
campy requires bad acting ,
but come on .
pamela springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job
of killing off my interest
than she did killing off the entire cast .
as far as comedy goes ,
there were a few time
where i chuckled ,
but it was few and far between.ultimately ,
sac ii is pretty boring ,
and i really did want to sleep away the camp .
the death are so obviously staged and fake
that you can barely appreciate them .
if you are looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp ,
i recommend club dread .
if your channel surfing takes you across this one ,
check and see what else is on .
