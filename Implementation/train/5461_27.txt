during the first 3 season fairly odd parent was as tasty as hard candy 
ight and sweet and addictive .
now it is as tasty as pepto-bismol .
and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you will need after viewing the more recent episode ,
where all the sweetness has been replaced by insult and violence
resulting in no laughs .
cosmo 
once one of the more endearing nick character 
has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin
that the cast of family guy would not even want to know .
timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad
that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of
( and given timmy 's snottiness ,
that would take a lot of beating ) .
and poor wanda ... a real charmer
who 's become the victim of her husband and godchild ,
she is now labeled a `` nag '' for caring about the well-being of other .
plus cosmo 's stupidity causes pain to everyone else
but he is never punished for it ,
nor does he learn any lesson .
which pretty much sums up butch hartman 's attitude toward kid :
they are crude 
vulgar and not too ight .
thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled 
along with butch hartman 's darling 
danny phantom .
at least butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo .
