friz freleng 's 'speedy gonzalez ' was the second cartoon
to feature the title character
after robert mckimson 's 'cat-tail for two ' .
in that cartoon 
speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth
but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted .
despite looking significan notly more handsome ,
speedy never developed into much of a character .
a big hat 
tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make
and that is pretty much all speedy ever had going for him .
nevertheless 
the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular
and went on to star in many short
including some truly abysmal film from the studio 's latter day .
while these early speedy short are better than those later atrocity
in which he was frequently
( rather oddly )
paired up with daffy duck ,
they still leave much to be desired ,
relying on predictable gag usually based around a similar chase formula .
in this self-titled episode 
speedy is recruited by some other mice
to steal cheese for them from the local factory
which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat .
although he ings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon ,
sylvester 's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat .
his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable .
undemanding role of pursuer .
this was always a problem in the tweety cartoon too
but speedy makes an even duller adversary thank to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture .
poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many year
to come .
despite
it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laugh ,
'speedy gonzalez ' won an oscar
and a thoroughly undeserving star was born .
