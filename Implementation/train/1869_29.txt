primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody
who watches this needs to realise
that this is a low budget b movie
and it knows it.a bunch of terrorist high-jack a lorry
and kill an entire army doing so 
they believe it to hold uranium 
but no ... .. it contains two dino 's with a taste for human flesh ... then a crack team ,
who might as well be called delta force
get called in.ok ,
this are not jurassic park ,
and yes the dino 's are never clearly seen
because it is obviously a guy in a costume
that is not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur -
only slightly less terrifying ,
but come on guy this had about 1 % of jurassic park 's budget
and as such does what it can.does this deserve to be in the bottom 100 ? ... .hell no ! ! !
i think
the nearly half of voter
who give this a 1 -
are being way way overly harsh ,
it is much closer to a 4 ...
it is actually a lot better than a whole host of other movie not in the bottom 100 ,
and has a similar production value to a sci-fi channel production .
( again movie
which get a overly harsh time from critic here on imdb )
the acting is as expected in a b movie
although none of the actor take it that seriously ,
neither does the scriptall in all it is an enjoyable b movie -
not for film snobs** out of *****
