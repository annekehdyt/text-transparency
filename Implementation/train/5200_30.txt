i stumbled upon this movie on cable
and was totally hooked .
the story of a group of surfer
who ride the big wave ,
wave
that are monstrously huge ,
wave
that would make any rational person run away in terror
is a one
that manages to be spectacular
and make you understand
why person spend their life chasing wave .
there is nothing special about the film ,
other
than it ings together some very interesting person
who are are in love with what
they do
and lets them talk .
sure there are scene of them surfing ,
but what makes this movie so special is the person .
here are a bunch of guy
who are so enthusiastic about what they do
that it crosses over to the person watching .
half way into this movie you will want to go off
and learn to surf as well .
few documentary have ever managed to covey the passion
that these person have and its the film ability
to make us feel
it that makes this a great film .
see it .
