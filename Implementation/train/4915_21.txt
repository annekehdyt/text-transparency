when i was very young 
on a local tv station ,
they would show kung fu movie of all kind on saturdays.i saw lot of kung fu movie on weekends.i remember lot of them.i saw great flick like crippled master 
blind fist of bruce 
kung fu zombie 
shaolin drunken monk 
rage of the master 
tattoe dragon 
and ... five deadly venoms.i remember
the day clearly.me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king.we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.we
ran in the house
and jumped onto the couch ,
turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.the usual intro of many kung fu movie clip in the background with the word kung fu saturday over it.then
under that was the title of the film.it said
five deadly venoms.then the movie began.i bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.i loved this movie the minute
it came on.my favorite character
was the toad venom.the plot was hard to follow at that age
but that was not what lured me ...
it was the fighting.the fight were so ... amazing.i moaned every time
a commercial
came on and soon the 2 hour of the best movie i have ever seen ended .
