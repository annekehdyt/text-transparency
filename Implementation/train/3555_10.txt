i was 15 year old
when this movie premiered on the television .
being raised in texas ,
i understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there .
this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart and i remembered
it fondly through the past 12 year .
i recently got to see it for the 2nd 
3rd and 4th time thanks the the love channel .
i still cry
because the movie reaches in and touch my inner confused teenager .
