usually i am a bit of a fan of the bad eighty and early ninety film
featuring now has been ...
but this film is so incredibly terrible
that it was a real endurance test
to sit through .
guy dressing up as girl has been done to death -
but never so pathetically .
corey haim 's performance was abysmal as usual ,
nicole eggert was not much better .
this has no redeeming quality ,
even if you are a number # 1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away !
