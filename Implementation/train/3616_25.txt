i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting .
the writing was top-notch .
jame arness is a great actor
and he showed it here .
brian keith was too old
to be davy crockett ,
and can anyone really play davy but fess parker ?
another great actor in this move was raul julia ,
who gave depth to santa anna 
a vain and complex person
who led mexico through turbulent times.while some may think
the movie was slow-paced ,
it captured the battle as it unfolded ,
lot of tedium
followed by a couple hour of horrific terror.what
impressed me most about this movie
is that it made you think about a cause
and how some person are willing to die for what they believe in .
in this day and age
when nobody stands for anything ,
i found it refreshing to think
that there was a time
when person died for freedom ,
no matter how you may feel about the politic of the time .
