neil simon has quite a body of work ,
but it is the odd couple
that carried him to fame .
this film really works .
jack lemmon and walter matthaw have a great chemistry .
the supporting cast for this film is stellar
as well.it is about 2 man living together
who are from opposite planet .
the script istles with humor from this situation .
this had been done in some form previously .
this is the one
that ings
it all together in a very good package.simon
has done some other decent work ,
but this one is really his best work
which made the rest of his work possible .
it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this .
