most of the episode on season 1 are awful..there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limit ,
as they program actually had decent story line .
most of amazing story are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent
or buy the twilight zone series ...
i have heard
season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the dvd 's they cut out the ray walston part
which further diminishes this compilation .
the one cool thing is to see actor and actress
when they were younger in 1985 ... most of the story line are very predictable
though and the series could of been better with twist
and turns
that left you wondering ...
