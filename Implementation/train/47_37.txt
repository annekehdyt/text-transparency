i know
the film snobs are snorting .
but if you are looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b-movie jungle ,
try `` jake speed '' .a little thin at time ,
but its one-liner and the location more then make up for this .
john hurt
( god love him ) ,
seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver .
the nemesis of crawford 
jake speed .
he adds a dimension to the film
that only a pro like hurt could provide .
crawford and dennis christopher
( jake sidekick )
are a good team ,
although you do wonder why
they both put up with each other.however ,
together both crawford and christopher portray a team
that is just so much fun that ,
if you can get over yourself for a moment ,
you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situation and the inherent suspense
they provide.the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress
that is more concerned about the motive of her rescuer then her tormentor.i have yet to find a movie
that is as much fun
without getting preachy 
or bogging down the movie
by trying too hard .
not every movie has to be the latest `` citizen kane '' .
and trust me 
well was an original .
so lets remember
that sometime 
movie are for fun.not social commentary
or attempting to sway an audience politically .
but just for the sheer fun of being alive
and living in a time
when our hero 's live in a celluloid dimension .
