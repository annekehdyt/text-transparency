it is very simple to qualify that movie :
`` a pure masterpiece '' .
this opinion is formulated for the following reason :
the performance of the actor 
they seem to be citizen of that epoch 
1100 b.c .
they personalize perfectly the character .
a second reason is that the poetry
expressed by homere in his poem
is well given by the production .
among other the narration
made by the chorus
give a particular atmosphere
that makes us party of the artistic rendition .
third reason :
the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect 
in mediterranean region ,
where the action of the poem occurred .
and most of all 
the emotion is on the rendezvous .
i repeat my appreciation :
`` a pure masterpiece '' .
