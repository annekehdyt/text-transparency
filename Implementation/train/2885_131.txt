there is an interesting discussion in this movie .
is being a moral person good enough ,
or do you need something more ?
the movie preaches
that
without the guidance of god ,
being a morally good person
is not enough .
there is a line early in the movie ,
`` you and i can look at a person
who is morally good ,
but both know he is going to go to hell .
`` while i am not a christian ,
the discussion about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating ,
but not in the way
the movie intended .
i left the movie with a stronger feeling
that being morally good *is* enough .
the argument and discussion presented were heavily biased ,
so much so
that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance .
fanaticism can be a powerful thing ,
especially when inferenced in the mind of the ignorant and uneducated .
as george carlin 's character in dogma said :
`` hook em
while they are young '' .the basic premise
is a very interesting one also .
a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book
that says
that morality
without god is ok ,
as long as the morality is meaningful .
do you only tell a child not to steal ?
or do you tell him not to steal
because god tell you not to ?
( not bothering inging up
that telling the child
not to steal because 
well ,
how would he feel
if it was his marble
that were stolen ?
) the author 
carlisle 
wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book
( to spread the world ) .
however 
it needs unanimous consent ,
and one of the scholar opposes it .
he ings up 
in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality 's sake vs god 's word argument .
to prove his point ,
he produces a time machine
( put in the movie solely to make the plot work ,
which i am fine with ) 
and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality
without god will lead us.as should be obvious ,
he has his opinion ,
and is changed by what he sees ,
and has reversed himself by the time of his return
( for he does return ,
that is not really a spoiler ,
this is a bible movie after all )
.as for the movie as a movie itself ,
it is pretty slow and pretty poorly acted .
something
that was *not* needed in this movie ,
is that it produces two `` bad guy ''
who want to try to figure out
who carlisle is ,
even tho he has not hurt anyone ,
committed a crime 
or anything .
what is wrong with the movie just showing carlisle 's opinion ,
showing his view of this `` sinful world '' ,
and returning him with a new viewpoint ?
also 
there a few point in the movie
which affirm to me
that i am happy i
am not a christian 
or at least someone
who says
`` it is god or nothing '' .
three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me.. first ,
when the two `` bad guy '' corner carlisle right
before he jumps ,
carlisle does his *only* truly despicable act..
he fakes like his time-jump is the coming of jesus ,
and makes it so the `` bad guy ''
( who are also christian btw 
oddly enough ) ,
think
they just missed the rapture .
secondly 
after carlisle return 
he finds a boy
in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing
( but not mentioning god ,
kid kept the marble
and ran away ) ,
and tell him this time
that stealing is wrong
because god commands it .
like the carlin quote above ,
scaring kid into religion
is a faux-pas in my book.and lastly 
the epilogue .
another scare tactic .
carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go ,
and he says
he does not know.. the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future
( starts at 2100 ) ,
and it fails.. he keeps decrementing the year by 10 ,
and trying again 
and by the fade-out 
he is at like 2030 or so .
throughout the movie 
carlise mention
that he felt the end of the world coming ,
because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god.. scare tactic
have been in use for thousand of year..
you would think in these enlightened time ,
the church would have enlightened
as well.i am glad i saw this movie .
while i was fairly certain
before that being morally good was enough ,
now i know it for a fact .
worth watching
if you are not a christian ,
to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folk in this movie .
