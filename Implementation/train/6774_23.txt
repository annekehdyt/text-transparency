`` the haunted world of edward d. wood 
jr. '' is the definitive documentary on the life of the man
who ought us such movie as `` glen or glenda '' 
`` bride of the monster '' 
and 
of course 
`` plan 9 from outer space '' .
this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentary 
such as `` look back in angora '' and `` the plan 9 companion '' 
failed .
it rounds up his surviving entourage ,
many of whom have passed away since filming ,
and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work .
nostalgic in the fact
that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood 
sentimental in its treatment of the director
( down to the haunting music ) ,
this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone
who loves the director
who so failed in his day .
the entire two hour of the film lovingly and retrospectively piece together ed 's life and untimely death for the viewer .
best watched at 3 am
while wearing an angora sweater .
