here is a horror version of priscilla :
queen of the desert
( they wish ! )
starring melinda/mindy
( return of the living dead 3 )
clarke as candy 
a desert dweller
who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend johnny
( jason durr ) .
he ends up in a south-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic chief screw
( an overacting robert englund in a toupee ) .
she and her beloved pet poodle end up in hiding at a gas station convent
until they are transformed by a newly fallen meteor .
the dog turn into obnoxious drag queen `` bitch ''
and candy develops a very long ,
talking ,
killing forked tongue
she can not control .
thug
looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskull
add extra complications.first off ,
clarke is fantastic
and makes what there is to make of this movie .
you watch her
and see someone very funny during the slapstick scene ,
very convincing during the horror scene and very sexy in various wig and disguise ,
including an eye-popping ,
skin tight latex bodysuit ...
and wonder
how come
this actress is not a huge star .
it is too bad
the rest of this cult attempt does not live up to her promise.blame director/scripter sciamma ,
who thinks
the outlandish premise alone is enough
to sustain laugh ...
but his vulgar gag ,
annoying supporting character and stupid dialogue
are no substitute for a real sense of humor .
another nail in the coffin ;
the film looks cheap ,
lot of garish color and set are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locale .
luckily for sciamma
that clarke is in his film ,
because she alone keeps you watching .
