having looked at some of the other comment here ,
i have a main complaint with this presentation .
the two primary character are attractive in their own way
- the beautiful `` victim 
'' and the handsome 
obviously extremely `` off-center 
'' blue-collar protagonist
( if just short of `` totally-deranged '' )
- take turns beating the hell out of each other ,
sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario.this is all right 
and this is 
of course 
mainly a `` turning-the-tables '' story .
however 
my referenced complaint is that i believe
the director got caught-up in his desire to display farrah 's well-known and obvious physical attribute .
beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe ,
and with a number of scene
displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect -
while immensely pleasing to the eye ,
these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.her roommates i am certain give performance as written and directed - however 
their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing 
do not ring true
-- based upon farrah 's previous experience with this guy 
the obvious evidence of his
having come to their premise with only the worst of intention ,
and that she would have absolutely no ground
to be exaggerating
what has occurred.but this is a film and story 
compelling as much in spite of ,
as because of 
the director 's work .
