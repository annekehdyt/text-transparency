an archaeologist
( casper van dien )
stumbles accidentally upon an ancient 
40 foot mummy 
well preserved underground in the nevada desert .
they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish translator
to assist
in figuring out the history of it .
the mummy 
as explained at the beginning 
is the son of a fallen angel
and is one of several giant
that apparently existed in `` those day '' .
in order to save his son from a devastating flood
which was predicted to kill everything ,
he mummifies his son 
burying him with several servant for century - planning to awaken him year from then .
in our present 
the fallen angel still walk the earth
and the mummy is resurrected
and a ritual is expected to take place .
most of the movie is slow ,
having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy 
air-punching fight .
the mummy is decent looking
but is not shown nearly enough .
it should have had more to do with that
but it dragged on a great deal so ... eh .
do not bother .
