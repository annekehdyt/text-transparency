watched this on dvd in original language with english sub .
either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog does not make much of story
and give any character development .
there are quite a few hk star in this
but the movie does not need their presence
to make it better or worse .
it is just bad .
the ight and colorful scene
done in cg
are attractive for the sheer color and illiance
but it can get overwhelming before long .
if anything this makes me think of a child 's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg 
fight scene 
and crap plot .
i am certain i grasped what took place in the film
but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy .
