this is really terrible.the only redeeming feature about this movie
is
that the next time person ask me what is the worst vampire movie i
have ever watched ,
i would have a suitable reply.i think
it is filmed on 35 mm
so it is already tacky like hell .
i would not have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboy
( probably connected to the movie )
had claimed
that this was the best movie since the matrix .
let me debunk
the myth and lies.there is nothing good in the movie .
everything yell tacky .
the actress is ugly .
the fight choreography is the worst i
have ever seen .
the fight scene are unbelievably amateurish .
imagine a girl flailing her arm around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kick
which would not hurt a kitten .
obviously 
the director just pulled person off the street
to give them role in the movie.i know
the director did not have much budget for the movie
but still better movie have been made on smaller budget before .
unforgivable .
