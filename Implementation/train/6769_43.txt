i happened to watch this movie
by chance some day ago
while flipping channel .
my expectation were not very high
but it was an interesting movie.in 'a guy thing ' 
jason lee plays paul 
a straight-laced 
seattle-based fellow
who is about to marry his fianc\u00e9e karen
( selma blair )
and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle-class domesticity .
we first meet paul at his bachelor party ,
where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activity his
( surprisingly few )
buddy encourage ,
in case he is a bit naughty
and gets into hot bother with his soon
to be trouble and strife .
of course 
the next thing paul knows ,
it is the morning after the night before ,
he is in bed with a naked hula dancer ,
and his mother-in-law phone to inform him
that karen is on her way over .
oh 
and the hula dancer is karen 's cousin becky
( julia stile )
.from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune 
as paul scrabble from misadventure to misadventure ,
trying to cover up
what he is done whilst
keeping up the appearance
of being a dutiful 
family-oriented good guy ,
who 's super-excited about his forthcoming nuptial .
his effort
to ensure karen remains
none the wiser about any potential wrong-doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun-loving becky ,
forcing him to question
whether he really wants the life
that seems to have been mapped out for him .
the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance .
definitely worth a watch .
