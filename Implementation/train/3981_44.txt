this is a review of 'freddy mercury the untold story 
' theatrical release 
chicago int .
film festival 
2007 one of the phoniest 
uninspired and most tedious biographical documentary i have seen .
if the film i saw in a movie theater
was originally released on tv ,
i would plead with its producer
and distributor to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature .
even as a made-for-tv documentary 
the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewee
sitting in front of flower arrangement in hotel room and the pompous ,
pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial .
the only redeeming aspect of this `` the untold story of freddy mercury ''
-- or 
uhm 
was it `` the untold story of princess diana '' are the original concert 
video and tv footage --
unaidged freddy mercury and queen .
testimonial interview with irrelevant eye witness with insight 
such as :
`` he was a free spirit 
''
( really.. i thought
freddy mercury was a company man ... )
belittle those freddy testimonial ,
by brian may or montserrat caballe
that shed new and affectionate light into mercury 's complex life and character .
and ... what up with the harry potter-like boarding school segment ?
how did the interview with the first girl-crush
( `` ...
who now works in a travel agency '' )
and member of freddy 's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury ?
vital milestone of his personal life 
his sexuality 
his artistic style and growth 
queen 
the band remain unexplored .
these filmmaker do not ask a single 
provocative question ,
nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject ,
instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comment about an enigmatic and illiant rock legend ,
who does not deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparent can doze off to on a sunday night .
