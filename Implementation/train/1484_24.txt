firstly 
i am not easily scared by ... anything except for my few phobia ,
but this movie is absolutely horrific .
this is not appropriate for child at all !
i had my mouth open the whole time
it just shocked
me i. could not believe
how gory it was for a child 's movie ,
bunny being utally murdered !
it is just unnecessary to be so horrifying
and be rated g. i recommend being over 8 to see this .
but do not get me wrong ,
it was probably a good movie
if i was not scarred mentally as a child .
i can not believe
a parent would allow a 
let 's say 
4 year old child to watch this .
it is just to intense and complicated ,
not to forget gory 
for young kid .
i am wayy over 4
and i was shocked by the violence .
i do not recommend
