wow i loved this movie !
it is about normal life in a small village .
about hypocrisy and honesty 
love and surrender .
great !
it is about thing everybody encounters in life .
you have to do thing with passion .
but some person will not appreciate your passion
and will try to stop you .
there are person
who find the opinion of other and 'what will the neighbor think ' more important than to follow their heart .
do not let anybody 's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dream and passion .
i loved the fact
that the actor were all really normal person ,
it could have been my family .
no big beauty ,
but all person you fall in love with during the movie .
