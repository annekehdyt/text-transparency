you can not deny
that we have an affinity for speed .
that is why movie like fast and the furious 
dhoom ,
rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audience 
especially local one .
we live on a tiny island ,
and i can not fathom why 
for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system 
most of us want to get into debt
by owning a set of wheel
which come with 100 % tax
when they reach our shore ,
and the myriad of taxe and bill
to pay
when operating one .
not only that 
the high end sport car were once quipped by a prominent politician up north
that
they will never reach fourth gear ,
lest they reach the sea.and
these movie are relatively easy to make .
hot wheel and hot chick always go down well together in targeting the required demographic .
for once 
those plunging neckline
exposing uncanny buxom and short skirt accentuating legs two meter long ,
can not compete with the attention
given to those beautiful curf
that exotic car possess in movie such as these .
of course there are amongst us
( ahem )
those
that go for the sexist portrayal of woman as mere sexual object
( otherwise explain
why motor shows come with truckload of model ,
and movie such as these can not do without a leggy model in a frame ) 
however 
they do not warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sigh
whenever the four wheeler come on screen ,
even when they do exactly nothing
and have their gear into park .
the guy
sitting beside me ,
i swear he wet his pant every time his dream car
( s )
appear ,
and creamed his pant even more when he hears those growling engine moans.so there
we have it ,
the fan boy
who turned up in drove just to watch which of the latest cool car get featured in the movie .
with the fast and the furious franchise 
the japanese model like the evos and the skyline take centerstage ,
as does the gt .
here 
the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification ,
that
even i am impressed ,
alongside the latest model like the ferrari enzos 
porshe carerra gts 
koenigsegg ccxs 
and every car out there
that has wing for door .
but seriously 
my heart goes out to the car each time
they are mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment .
i mean 
this are perfectly fine 
high performance model
that are at the apex of motoring ,
but yet because whoever financed the movie had million to blow ,
they do so
because they can ,
there is no story in redline ,
just excuses to put together a movie full of beauty ( the car that is ) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible 
and with the usual shot of pedal
( always the accelerator ,
mind you ,
tapping the ake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy ,
and earn you no respect ) ,
steering wheel 
gear shift
( always shifting up and not down ) ,
all these
while having the actor
make pretend
that they are the baddest ass with an engine ,
snarling and giving each other dirty look .
not a very tall order for an actor ,
and that is why we get the most woeful performance ever 
with line
that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.the heroine
( yes ,
it made a statement that girl can drive )
natasha
( a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin )
is one of those million dollar find - a girl with model look
who do not mind getting down on four and immersed in oil ,
who has racing pedigree within her ,
and perform with a rock band singing song with lyric
that are just plain laughable
( every line had to do with car ,
and
when singing about love ,
just had to string those innuendo like shifting gear shaft 
luican not and going for ride ) .
introduced against her wish
to illegal racing by a gangsta
called infamous
( eddie griffin ) ,
she gets drawn into family squabble
involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran ,
and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle .
everything else ,
well like i said ,
just serves as an excuse for the movie
to go from race to race.and
it is almost always the same ,
as there is very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race car ,
especially when you know
the race is rigged
( for narrative reason )
and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line .
while fast and furious had quite charismatic actor ,
and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker 
sun kang 
and of course 
the star
it
created - vin diesel ,
redline had none ,
just pretty faces with lot of air unfortunately .
it look like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go ,
with a very insipid opening sequence
where it is one man 
one car 
and a 105 minute race against time
to get to vegas.if not for the car ,
then this movie seriously is a piece of junk 
with bad acting 
bad line and bad action .
strictly for the car fan 
or those
who like their movie with countless of bevy beauty
who pimp their body
without any speaking line .
