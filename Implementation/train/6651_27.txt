`` return of the jedi '' is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right ,
and that is a shame ,
because the last chronological installment in the star war saga is a shining example of epic storytelling .
it manages to wrap up all story line of the previous movie in one grand finale ,
and does so very convincingly.yes ,
there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bear
that arguably served to oaden the star war demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit .
but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga ,
where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader ,
the most recognizable villain in movie history.return of the jedi did so many thing right
that person tend to overlook :
it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline
( which went from slightly implausible in the `` empire strike back '' to very convincing here ) ,
an exciting opening at jabba 's palace 
a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor 
luke finally coming into his own 
the resolution of solo and leia 's romance 
and the extremely powerful final moment on the endor moon.ye ,
there are slight annoyance .
but they are the annoyance of a generation of moviegoer
who 've had time
to nitpick every single scene .
it is still a magical
and moving piece of cinema
that also serves as a great final chapter .
it is not a 'good ' movie -
it is fantastic !
