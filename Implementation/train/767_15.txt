this is one of my favorite mr. motos ,
and i have seen them all .
as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr. moto .
lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator ,
the usual comic relief is quite funny here ,
and there are lot of suspect on whom to cast an eye .
it is fast paced
and fun.the archaeologist does not have quite the same flair as thomas beck 
the usual second lead in these programmer ,
but he is adequate .
stepin fetchit is on board ,
and
while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his line are funny ,
not demeaning to his intelligence ,
and he actually saves the day in his ief time on screen .
