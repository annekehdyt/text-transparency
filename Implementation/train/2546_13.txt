i had not seen this movie since the late '80
and decided to pick up the vhs version of it .
the plot is very slow ,
and the actor almost seem robotic in this eakdance flick .
the music 
hip hop/freestyle artist and the eakdancing scene are what make this movie special .
the eakdancing is actually better in this movie than in `` breakin ' '' ,
but i have to say
that `` breakin ' 1and2 '' carry the energy and excitement to the screen a lot better .
it is a movie i will keep in my liary ,
but it is not a movie
that i can watch over and over again ,
just once in a blue moon .
