now i had the pleasure of first viewing contaminated man
when it premiered on tv back in december of 2000.an infectious disease expert
( william hurt )
looses his family
when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them .
now some year later he is now in russia or someplace .
i am not sure
where exactly ,
all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area .
anyway ,
because of budget cutback at an infectious disease laboratory ,
they are forced to lay off most of their worker .
one of them 
a disgruntled security guard named joseph muller
( played peter weller ,
best known for his role as the indestructible robocop )
goes in there and demand
that they give him his job back .
he needs this job
because he is divorced
and he needs it to pay child support .
so he goes in there 
a fight eaks out ,
and some thing get knocked over 
dangerous thing .
it is soon discovered
that muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen .
in fact it is so deadly ,
one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of second .
soon word gets out and the disease expert
( hurt )
is called in to investigate
and he later teamed up with an american reporter .
now muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son
and will stop at nothing
even if he has to infect the entire russian population.now
as i said
before this film is a lot like falling down .
we have a disturbed person
( weller here 
michael douglas in falling down )
who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal
even if they have to kill a few person in the process .
next we have a hero-type person
( hurt here ,
robert duvall in falling down )
who is both sympathetic
and determined to stop the antagonist.contaminated man
is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances.8/10
