a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son
who died of kidney cancer .
so he thinks :
why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark .
well 
who would not ?
it is a little hard to cope with the fact
that the hammerhead shark
that is killing everybody
is constantly being called `` paul '' .
also 
william forsythe is cast as a macgyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility .
on the other hand there are a few hot chick
who make you actually look at the screen
while shark paul bites another one to death .
as a matter of fact i find bad b-movie quite amusing .
but for my taste it would have been a much better movie
if it was made for say 1000000 buck less .
then it might have been fun .
