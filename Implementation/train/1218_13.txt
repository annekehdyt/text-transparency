to be honest ,
this film is another in a series of huge disappointment ... most of these so-called `` master of horror '' film are only horrifying in term of their sub-par effect and laughable story line ... aside from ron perlman ,
everyone else in this film can not act to save their life ...
the gunshot sounded like someone was playing bop-it under the boom mike or something ,
and looked completely unrealistic ... overall 
this film is about as scary as home alone ...
the only good master are cigarette burn 
jennifer ,
and maybe pelt ... i do not know
how these director can sleep at night
knowing
that they have ruined the very genre
that some of them used to actually understand ...
