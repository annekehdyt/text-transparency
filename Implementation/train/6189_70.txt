there is a story
( possibly apocryphal )
about an exchange between bruce willi and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkey .
gilliam
( allegedly )
produced a long list
( think about the aircraft one from the fifth element )
and handed it to butch bruce .
it was entitled `` thing bruce willi does
when he acts '' .
it ended with a simple message
saying :
`` please do not do any of the above in my movie ''
.there is a fact about this movie
( definitely true ) .
gilliam did not have a hand in the writing.i
would contend
that these two factor played a huge role
in creating the extraordinary
( if not commercial )
success
that is the twelve monkey.visually ,
the twelve monkey is all
that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film .
it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general
( but magnificent ) strangeness .
gilliam delight in wrong-footing his audience .
although the ending of the twelve monkey will surprise no one
who has sat through the first real ,
gilliam borrow heavily from kafka in the clockwork 
bureaucratic relentless movement of the character towards their fate .
it is this journey ,
and the character development they undergo ,
which unsettles.i love gilliam film
( brazil 
in particular ) .
but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness .
he seems to have so many idea ,
and so much enthusiasm ,
that his film almost invariably end up as a tangled mess
( brazil 
in particular ) .
i still maintain
that brazil is gilliam 's tour de force ,
but there is no denying
that the twelve monkey 's is a eath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department .
style 
substance and form seem to merge in a way
not usually seen from the ex-python.whatever the truth of the rumour above ,
gilliam also manages to get a first rate
( and very atypical )
performance out of the bald one .
bruce is excellent in this film ,
as are all the cast ,
particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - brad pitt.it is been over a decade
since this film was released .
when i watched it again ,
i realised
that it had not really aged .
i had changed 
of course .
and this made me look at the film with fresh eye .
this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film
that 
partly at least 
is about reflection in mirror 
altered perspective and the absurd one-way journey through time
that we all make .
a first rate film .
8/10 .
