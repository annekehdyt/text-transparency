a truly 
truly dire canadian-german co-production ,
the ever-wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress
whose teenage daughter redefines the term `` problem child ''
- a few uear prior to the `` action ''
the child murdered her father ,
and mum took the fall for the offspring .
now she is moved up to the northwest us
to start over ,
but her child still has a problem in that she is devoted to her mother .
so devoted in fact that she kills anyone
who might be seen as a threat to their bond.unfortunately mandy schaeffer
( as the daughter )
murders more than person -
she delivers such a terrible performance
that she also wipes out the movie 
though the incoherent script 
useless direction and appalling music
( check out the saxophone the first time
she displays her bikini-clad bod )
do not help any ;
we are supposed to find her sexy and scary ,
but she fails on both count .
almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing
( not to mention the fact
that arquette and schaeffer do not really convince as mother and daughter ) ,
all condolence to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow ,
both of whom are worthy of far more than this 
and both of whom
( particularly rosanna )
are the only sane reason for anyone
to sit through this farrago.one of the production company
is called quality international film - not since the three-hour `` love 
lies and murder ''
( from two short production )
has there been such a `` you must be joking '' credit .
