wow .
if you think
that a film can not fatigue in some way ,
then you have not seen dog bite dog .
this film pulls no punch ,
and it does not shy away from showing very disturbing image at all .
much like salo 
this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit .
it is gritty 
dark 
depressing and hopeless ,
but it is also one of the best film
to ever come out of hong kong.the script is much more of the same ,
but do not go on thinking
it is incredibly clich\u00e9d .
it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game 
against a professional and emotionless hit-man .
while the script offers nothing new on the surface ,
it does provide a lot of question about the dark side of humanity .
is violence really that necessary ?
do we become more or less human
when we abuse a 5 year old child ,
without pity ,
without remorse ?
in turn 
we human act no less than rabid dog
when we are blinded by anger ,
this is a sad truth .
it is a topic that the director illiantly explores ,
without limiting himself at all .
besides the cat and mouse chase ,
the script also develops two separate story line for the main character .
one is about love ,
and the other is about redemption .
even if the script is not that new ,
it is still wonderfully written
and it keeps you glued to the seat at all time .
the acting is really ,
really good .
edison chen as the hit-man is incredible ;
he proves
that he is not just any pretty face .
he is ruthless 
vile and beyond likable .
sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding .
the supporting cast 
in short 
is excellent .
the music is also worth mentioning .
very somber score by ben cheung ,
with some effective light hearted song played at key dark moment in the film .
the cinematography by yuen man is also really good.overall ,
this catiii film is highly recommended .
very well paced 
incredibly acted 
marvelously scored
and just really good at the end of it all .
however ,
as many have pointed out ,
this is not a movie for everyone .
if you dislike strong violence
then you should stay away from this one .
if you do not like
seeing heavy negativity in film
then this is not for you too .
in the end 
a powerhouse film 
8/10 .
