i pity person
calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan ' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood !
comeon guys..this movie is a thriller
without thrill..come out of your ulagam
and just watch some high class thriller like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs.technically good but style over substance kamal does not look like a police officer ,
there is no thrill whatsoever dragging
and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life
if u skip watching this movie.kamal at his best
is the best in tollywood
