paris 
je t'aime
( 2006 )
is a film
made up of 18 segment .
you can do the math
-- 18 segment in 120 minute means each director had seven minute
to tell her or his story .
the movie is based on the premise
that you can 
indeed ,
tell a story in that short amount of time .
the premise works .
almost all of the segment are powerful 
complete 
and satisfying .
each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience ,
and almost every director draws forth outstanding performance from a cast of great and near-great actors.there were so many powerful portrayal in this film
that it is hard to pick one or two favorite .
probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment `` place des victoire 
''
gena rowlands as an aging beauty in `` quartier latin 
'' catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment `` loin du 16\u00e8me '' and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier
who has learned to speak french
so she can visit paris
( `` 14\u00e8me arrondissement '' segment ) .
special mention must be given to gulliver hecq 
probably the meanest little boy
to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station
( segment `` tuilery '' )
.this is an outstanding movie .
my wife and i decided to rent it in a few month
so we can catch some of the subtle point
we surely missed .
however 
paris is photographed so beautifully
that i would suggest
that you try to see it on a large screen .
in any case 
do not miss it !
