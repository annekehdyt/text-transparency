honestly 
this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
partly ,
because it takes itself so seriously ,
as opposed to regular light hearted trash ,
this movie wants you to be emotionally involved ,
to feel for the character 
and to care about the alleged conspiracy .
none of this ever even comes close to happening .
****mild spoilers******there are 3 main reason
why this movie is so terrible :
1 . )
incoherent and totally non-sensical plot .
2 . )
annoying style-over-substance `` mtv '' camerawork .
3 . )
moronic character and plot hole.allow me to elaborate.1 . )
apparently ,
when this movie was being made ,
they could not decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracy 
the stigmatum 
or possession .
so 
guess what ?
they combined them !
an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person ,
who then makes her exhibit the stigmatum so as to expose a church conspiracy .
how a regular person is able to transcend death
and possess another human
being through his rosary
is never explained ,
nor even talked about .
now ,
instead of just saying
what he wants to say ,
he gives her the stigmatum .
why ?
why not just spit it out ?
instead 
we get treated to scene of screaming thing in harsh voice ,
carving cryptic message on car ,
and writing message on wall .
apparently this priest was also a violent guy ,
because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the character ,
while talking in that cliched 
harsh 
`` possessed '' voice
that we all have heard countless time .
this also starts to tie into my second complaint ,
because whenever the young lady gets the stigmatum ,
she also defies the law of gravity by floating into the air ,
and tossing everything and everybody around her
as if they were in an earthquake ?
why does this happen ?
who knows ! ? !
my guess is that the director thought
it looked `` cool '' .2 . )
this movie contains dozen of shot 
in slow motion 
of course 
of bird showing up out of nowhere and flying off 
and most annoyingly 
of water dripping .
this woman 's apartment is constantly dripping water !
constantly !
logically 
the place would probably fall apart with this many hole .
to sum up this complaint 
towards the end ,
and for absolutely no reason 
the camera cuts to shot of water dripping 
in slow motion 
in reverse ! !
why ! ? !
i have no idea !
it has no relevance to anything ,
and once again 
i am betting
it is because the director thought
it looked `` cool '' .3 . )
one of the main character says
he became a priest
to explain away hole in science .
this does not make sense to me .
i would think
that going to church would be enough ,
but no 
he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest .
i just do not buy it .
secondly 
there are lot of plot hole ,
a few of which i will elaborate on below .
for starter ,
when she first gets the stigmatum ,
the scene ends with her laying unconscious 
bleeding .
next 
she is in the hospital .
who called the ambulance ?
another one is towards the end ,
when the previously mentioned `` scientific priest '' character is talking to the spirit
who is possessing the girl .
he says ,
`` take me as your messenger ! ''
not a word for word quote ,
but you get the idea .
his response ?
`` you have no faith ,
only doubt ! ''
so ,
because of this ,
he possesses an aetheist !
an aetheist has no faith 
far less then any scientific priest !
and then 
there is the fact
that the object of this movie 's conspiracy 
this lost gospel
( of st. thomas ,
i believe )
is available at local bookstore .
the character are willing to kill to supress this document ,
but you could walk down to a bookstore
and buy it .
maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history ,
where it is not wide known ,
but the movie never tries to tell us this 
or to even hint
that this is an alternate happening
of that document 's uncovering.in closing ,
this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree .
it is my arch-nemesis ,
which i feel the need
to insult every chance i get .
i loathe it .
final grade :
