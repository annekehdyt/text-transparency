tv version of `` twister '' springs a few leak
but manages to remain watchable .
my sister bought this at a wal-mart a few year back
when it was released ,
i saw it back then
and thought
it was okay .
later `` twister '' with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out
( or was it before ?
i think
it was '97 )
and did a better job overall .
but `` twister '' was more silly fun ;
this is realistic with a message .
it all depends on what you want from a movie with twister :
twister 
or a low-budget character study ? john schneider and devon sawa
( he is the reason
my sister bought it )
star 
and devon sawa ,
who went on to `` wild america 
''
`` final destination '' and `` slacker '' got his big eak here .
so in a way 
i was one of the first person
to see him really take off .
i do not know
if it is an honor or a shame ,
i have not seen
how he acts in recent film .
`` night of the twister '' all depends on personal taste ,
like i said ,
it all depends on what you want from a movie with twister :
twister 
or a low-budget character study .
`` night of the twister '' has the latter .
so you decide.i give it a 2.5/5 ... -
