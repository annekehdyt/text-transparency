wow 
i hated this movie .
the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film ,
and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough
to handle the topic ,
but the script -
if there even *was* a script -
is a mess .
this is less a movie than a random slide show
that goes nowhere .
i would say
it goes nowhere fast ,
except that it is actually the longest 81 minute you will ever sit through .
as i have mentioned ,
the lead actor is good .
so is faruza baulk
( sp ?
) 
as his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother .
the film maker have a lot
to answer for here ,
because this is a mess .
a real shame ,
because i really wanted to like this movie ,
but it is basically out-take from a movie
that never got made .
skip this one - it was not even worth the $ 6 i shelled out for pay-per-view .
