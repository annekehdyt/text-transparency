i noticed this movie was getting trashed well
before it hit the theater and i too did not have high hope for it .
i figured
it was another `` you got served '' type of movie with some nice dance move and horrid acting .
i was at the theater
and deciding between this
and meet the spartan
and picked this .
to my surprise
the acting was not bad at all
and the movie was actually pretty good .
the fact
that it has a lower rating
than you got served
is absolutely ridiculous .
instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matin\u00e9e showing of this movie
so you do not spend too much .
i think
you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it .
when it comes to dance movie this
is certainly one of the better one with far superior acting than many of the other one .
go see the movie
and judge for yourself .
hopefully the rating will rise
after it comes out on dvd and more person check
the movie out instead of judging
it based on comment
before the movie released.edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating .
over 1000 person have given it a rating of 9 
a bit too high
but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous vote of 1 .
