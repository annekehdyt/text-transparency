diego armando maradona was ,
and still remains as the best football player ,
the game has offered .
not just an athlete 
but an artist .
this documetary
if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memory of every football fan around the world .
because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal ,
which he scored against my own country
( england ) .
there is absolutely no point of diminishing this star .
although i do not undersand spanish ,
i can appreciate the argentine narrator .
he actually cries of happiness ,
and can barely express his emotion ...
.. anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend ,
but reader ... ..you have to watch this to know what i mean .
