of all the british imperialist movie like four feather 
charge of the light brigade for example 
this movie stands out as the cream of the crop .
it reflects a time
when `` the sun never set on the british empire . ''
get over it .
i will not go into why
because so many other have expressed the many reason
that makes this film great .
i have visited the alabama hill
and have photographed the pass
through which the british marched
and it remains
as it was ,
unchanged by time and encroachmant by man and vandal .
and even though i know it is coming ,
seeing din lying dead on a stretcher
and when these line are read `` yes 
din !
din !
din ! you lazarushian-leather gunga din !
though i have belted you and flayed you 
by the livin ' gawd
that made you ,
you are a better man than i am 
gunga din '' i still 
at 54 year of age 
get misty eyed and anyone
who says
they do not is a liar .
the range of emotion within it is the mark of a great movie .
like the ending of another great film 
of mouse and man .
