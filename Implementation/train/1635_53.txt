... they bothered making this movie ?
anyone ?
i did not think
so.if you are looking for a coming-of-age movie 
go rent summer of '42 .
this is no summer of '42.when your big star are nolte and sarsgaard ,
and sarsgaard gets more screen time ,
that is your first warning sign
and 
of course 
for such an `` artsy '' movie 
there is plenty of cursing and skin flung around ,
just to make it look `` artsy '' .sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting 
cardboard character 
punctuated by moment
that were supposed to be intense .
the intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder.miller is most famous for her looks
and what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie .
pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her .
she misrepresented
an actual pittsburgh native.foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style .
wow !
was this his first role after high school graduation ? so ,
we have this weird triangle .
foster has a crush on miller ,
but is with his boss/girlfriend .
he can not take miller to bed ,
and will not take his boss to bed .
so 
he hangs with sarsgaard and miller ,
and watch them get it on.then ,
after one of sarsgaard 's pseudo-intense moment 
foster and miller get it on 
a scene
that we are `` treated '' to in every sloppy 
moaning detail .
finally 
just to round it all out ,
foster and sarsgaard get it on 
with foster in the miller role .
now i know
how 2 guy get it on
( as if that was ever anything i needed to know )
.after all that ,
all
that is left
is the tragic ending for one character and the retrospective view of the remaining 2.
it gets me right in the pit of my stomach .
oh 
wait !
that was the pepperoni pizza i just had.i would like back the time this movie
took out of my life 
please .
