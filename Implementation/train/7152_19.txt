who not only listens to belushi 's `` story '' ,
but has a `` cure '' for all of belushi 's middle class problem :
a magic potion to ing about an avalanche of change in belushi 's life.flashback show a 15 year old horribly ashamed
of causing his high school baseball team 's championship defeat .
belushi goes on with his `` pitiful life '' 
seemingly happy ,
but always wondering `` what if ... '' for what seems to be several day ,
belushi experiences a `` different '' life 
one of enormous success
