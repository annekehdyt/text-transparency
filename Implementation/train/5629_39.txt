yes 
i loved this movie
when i was a kid .
when i was growing up i saw this movie so many time
that my dad had to buy another vhs copy
because the old copy had worn out.my family
received a vhs copy of this movie
when we purchased a new vhs system .
at first 
my mom was not sure
that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old
but because we had just bought a new vhs system
she let me watch it.like i said ,
this movie is every little boys dream the movie
contains a terrific setting 
big muscled barbarian 
beautiful topless woman ,
big bad monster and joke you will only get
when you get older .
so 
a couple of day ago i inserted the video
and watched the movie again after a long time .
at first 
i was bored ,
then started thinking about how much i loved this movie
when i was kid ,
and continued watching .
yeah 
the experience was not as great
as i remembered the acting is pretty bad ,
the storyline is pretty bad ,
the joke were not funny anymore ,
but the woman were still pretty .
yes 
i have grown up .
even though the movie experience has changed for me ,
i still think
it is worth 7 star .
for the good old time you know
