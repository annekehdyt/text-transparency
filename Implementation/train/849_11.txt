a solid 
if unremarkable film .
matthau 
as einstein 
was wonderful .
my favorite part 
and the only thing
that would make me go out of my way to see this again ,
was the wonderful scene with the physicist playing badmitton ,
i loved the sweater and the conversation
while they waited for robbin to retrieve the birdie .
