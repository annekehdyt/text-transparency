the 1960 's were a time of change and awakening for most person .
social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as person spoke-out about their view .
racial tension 
politic 
the vietnam war 
sexual promiscuity 
and drug use were all part of the daily faic 
and the daily news .
this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspect into an entertaining movie ,
and largely succeeded.in this film 
two family are followed :
one white 
one black .
during the first half of the film 
the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggle .
unfortunately 
the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family .
admittedly 
there are more character in this family ,
and the story line are intermingled ,
but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspect of this century.on the whole ,
the acting is well done
and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage
to give a documentary feel to the movie .
the movie is a work of fiction ,
but clip of well-known historical figure are used
to set the time-line.i enjoyed the movie
but the situation were predictable
and the storyline was one-sided .
