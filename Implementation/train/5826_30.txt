spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow
which then takes revenge on everyone.this movie
really annoyed me .
it has a great looking monster ,
has some good low budget effect ,
some atmosphere
but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad .
half way in i started to fast forward
and then step through the chapter on the dvd.the problem with this movie are many .
first off the cast looks about thirty
and yet they are suppose to be in high school .
you do not believe anything from the get go as a result .
the scarecrow ,
while looking great is not much beyond that .
he says
stupid one liner and move in a manner more
designed to be funny then scary .
is this a comedy or a horror movie ?
its a problem
that goes beyond the one liner to much of the dialog and set up .
it seems more send up of every clich\u00e9 than heartfelt horror film .
i some how expect
that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind 
horror fan
who want to mock the genre rather than emace it.despite the good
looking monster this
is a film
to avoid .
even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five buck ,
you are paying too much.avoid .
