trust me 
this is one let down movie
that you want to avoid
and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan .
the frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a great film .
the first part of this movie does an exceptional job
of setting up the character and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he is paid to protect .
the trailer to this movie all mention
that she is kidnapped .
so 
i am giving nothing away
when i say
that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess
after she is kidnapped .
whatever the director was trying to accomplish ,
all he succeeds
in doing is making the audience literally nauseous .
rapid 
frantic and choppy cut follow for the next half-hour as creasy track down the perpetrator .
these cut are so unnatural and nauseating
that all they do is to jolt you out of the story .
i am sure the director thought
that this unsettling way
to present the story signified a change in creasy 's character and signified
that a different movie was to follow .
well 
he was right .
the movie
that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap .
the result of which is a depressing ending
that ruins even the quality first forty minute of the movie .
