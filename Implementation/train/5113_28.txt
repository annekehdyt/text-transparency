spoiler many different comedy series nowaday have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence .
in an early episode of cartoon `` family guy ''
the griffin family find
their home is an independent nation to the united state of america and the story progresses from there .
way back in 1949 however 
the ealing studio produced a wonderful little film along the same idea.after a child 's prank ,
the resident of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure .
at the inquest it becomes clear
that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy .
withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain 
the resident of the small street experience the joys and the problem
with being an independent state.based at a time
when rationing was still in operation ,
this story is illiantly told and equally inspiring .
featuring performance by stanley holloway 
betty warren 
philip stainton and a young charle hawtrey ,
the film is well stocked with some of the finest actor of their generation .
these actor are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking line .
feeling remarkably fresh ,
despite being over 50 year old ,
the story never feels awkward
and always keeps
the audience entertained.ealing studio was one of the finest exporter of british film ever in existence .
with film like `` passport to pimlico '' it is not difficult to see why .
amusing from start to finish ,
the story is always fun
and always worth watching .
