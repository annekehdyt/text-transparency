you have to admire brad syke
even if you do not particularly want to 
a man
who churns out budget horror
after budget horror to less than enthusiastic reception .
but keeps on doing it all the same .
even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood film is given grudgingly and i am as guilty of this as anyone .
brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix 
a neat idea 
a kooky character 
whatever ,
but
without the fund
to take it further than base level ,
he relies on the audience
to cut him some slack
and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be .
joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to syke
that he can sense
that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film .
coming to a multiplex near you 
in a parallel universe 
somewhere .
