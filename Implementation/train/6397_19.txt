there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this `` film '' .
the original said
it all and still holds up .
either read the book or do some research about the story ,
and you will realize
this remake is ludicrous .
eric robert as perry smith ?
his sister could have done a better job !
having been to holcomb and edgerton ,
ks
where the story takes place ,
the set and location looked nothing like kansas .
the original is riveting ,
from the location filming to the use of the actual participant 
weapon and victim belonging .
unforgettable performance by scott wilson and robert blake .
soundtrack by quincy jone and cinematography by conrad hall ...
the original is available on dvd in widescreen now .
let this turkey die a quick death .
