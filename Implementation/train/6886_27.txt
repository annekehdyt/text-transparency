being from canada ,
i can not say
whether this film is original in the context of danish cinema - unfortunately ,
we 
here 
do not get to see many danish film in a year !
i also can not comment on clausen 's acting in the context of his other role -
i personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man 
this jorgen !
as for the actor
who played kenneth -
why would his participation in a tv show rule him out
as an actor - are not we over such elitist attitude ?
international viewer unaware of his big brother participation will find him a fair actor.in
spite of the movie 's fault
( the writing could have been subtler in some instance ) ,
i do subscribe to what one could call the 'message ' of the film - namely art 's essential role in everyday life 
art as healing force .
art ,
as nietzsche said ,
sanctifies the lie
( 'kunst heiligt die luege ' )
- it is a holy lie :
the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense - a theatrical 
not religious 
wedding 
celeating love and life as play ...
