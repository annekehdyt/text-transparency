dick clement and ian la frenai have a solid hit rate
as far as their tv work is concerned .
however 
their film work has been much more chequered
( 2008 's the bank job was fine ,
the previous year 's across the universe decidedly weak 
for instance )
.still crazy 
fortunately 
is a solid success .
it has a great story 
excellent performance 
a lot of humour 
fabulous music and 
above everything else 
real heart.i savour `` moment '' ,
and this film has one of them -
just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance ... hugely enjoyable .
