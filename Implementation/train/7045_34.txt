`` soylent green '' is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movie of the 70 's
and still very persuasive even by today 's standard .
although flawed and a little dated 
the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise
( typical for that time )
still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking .
this film 's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flick
because of its strong cast and some intense sequence
that i personally consider classic .
the new york of 2022 is a depressing place
to be alive 
with over-population 
unemployment 
an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product .
the only form of food available is synthetic
and distributed by the soylent company .
charlton heston
( in a great shape )
plays a cop
investigating the murder of one of soylent 's most eminent executive
and he stumbles upon scandal and dark secret ...
the script is a little over-sentimental at time
and the climax does not really come as a big surprise ,
still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny .
the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macae moment in 70 's cinema .
edward g. robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role
and there is a great
( but too modest )
supportive role for joseph cotton
( `` baron blood '' ,
`` the abominable dr. phibe '' ) .
this is science-fiction in my book :
a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity !
no fancy space-ship with hairy monster attacking our planet .
