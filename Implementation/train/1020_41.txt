this show is possibly the biggest 
ugliest 
most generic steam
pile i have seen in child 's programming
that is actually become successful .
the lead character 
johnny ,
while i understand
he is supposed to represent an ordinary kid ,
is not likable or even tolerable .
the joke are lame 
overdone
( i.e .
the `` whoa !
did not see that coming '' gag .
come on ,
that was not even funny the first time .
it is not even cute )
and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration .
and lastly ... it is just plain ugly to look at .
while kid are not especially critical of artistic talent ,
they still prefer eye candy .
i can not stand watching the show ,
because in a way ,
the art style is just ... gross .
hideous 
in fact .
just plain crummy .
i just can not stand that this is getting so much airtime .
while i understand
that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i should not be getting my hope up on it coming back ...
i really miss the old cartoon .
bring back dexter 's laboratory 
the powerpuff girl ... anything but this crap .
i guess
it is just wishful thinking though.simply put ,
i advise you do not waste your time on this show .
i believe
that truly good cartoon are able to be enjoyed by the big kid 
too .
and this does not cut it .
