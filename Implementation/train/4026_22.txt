actually 
this is a lie ,
shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie .
i bought it on dvd about 3 year ago .
did not bug 's life also do that ?
i think
it was at disneyworld in that tree ,
so i am saying
before they go and use that as there logo .
also 
shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studio .
they should still consider it as a movie ,
because it appeared in a `` theater ''
and you could buy it for dvd .
the movie was cute ,
at least the little flye were .
i liked iq .
i agree with animaster ,
they did a god job out
of making a movie out of something
that is just a out-and-back adventure .
i recommend it to family and kid .
