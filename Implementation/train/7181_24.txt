this is indeed a funny show ,
done in a creepy sort of way ,
much like a tim burton film .
it is worth a look ,
as it is far more creative than most of the show this season .
best of all 
it is not a `` reality '' show .
i am wondering
why the viewing public is so ready to accept show like that
( which lack creativity )
and ignore wonderful show like this
that actually have a creative bent.while some decry the premise ,
i think
it is really unusual .
much more enjoyable than `` ghost whisperer '' and `` medium '' .
i think
it is the funniest thing on the tube
since `` my name is earl '' .oh ,
and the narration and music are wonderful .
if you enjoy show
that are a bit off the beaten path ,
i would recommend it .
it is not as strange as twin peaks was ,
but it is got a serious kink to it .
