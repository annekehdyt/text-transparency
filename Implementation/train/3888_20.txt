about three minute into this thing i started fast-forwarding 
pausing only during the nudity
( why is it that bad movie always include such good looking woman ? ) .
in ten minute i was done ,
and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store .
the person
who write these movie
should be sanctioned by the mpaa .
come on writer -
the bad guy always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy 's remote control !
that is the way
its been done since the day of the ottoman empire !
also ,
to add insult to injury ,
the `` twist '' at the end was so formulaic ,
that it could have come from any action movie
written in the past 25 year .
burt reynold was fine ,
but he should concentrate on real movie.this movie is just a waste of time - run away !
run away !
