i saw this film about twenty year ago on the late show .
i still vividly remember the film 
especially the performance of robert taylor .
i always thought
taylor was underrated as an actor as most critic saw him as solid 
almost dull leading man type ,
and woman simply loved to watch his film
because of his look .
this film 
however 
proved what an interesting actor he could be .
he did not get enough role like this during his long career .
this is his best performance .
he is totally believable in a truly villainous role .
from what i have read ,
he was a very hardworking
and easy going guy in real life
and never fought enough for these kind of role .
he basically would just do what mgm gave him .
this film proves
that he could have handled more diverse and difficult role .
the other thing i
remember about this film
is how annoying lloyd nolan 's character was .
nolan was a great actor ,
but this character really aggravated me .
the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these year .
this film is definitely worth a look .
