as the one-line summary says ,
two movie have left such a remark on me
when i walked out of the theater .
the one was `` stir of echo '' with kevin bacon ,
and the second was `` vanilla sky '' .its one of those movie
that you sit deep in the theater seat
and stop thinking about anyone around you ,
stop wondering
what the end of the movie will be
and just leave the movie swift you
where it wants ... walking out of the cinema was a bit weird ,
like that feeling you get
when you are sick
and can not think of anything .
one of those movie
that you become one with the guy ,
and feel
that nothing else moves around you
than the thing in the movie.one thing is certain .
the actor are awesome ,
the sound track is excellent ,
and everything in the movie is 9+.surely one of the best movie i ever saw ,
and the movie
that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world .
