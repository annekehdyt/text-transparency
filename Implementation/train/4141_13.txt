this is 2009 and this way
underrated gem has lost nothing of the power
it had 31 year ago .
it connects a pretty wide variety of different character and story
without appearing to be cluttered.clothe and music might have changed over time ,
but in the end this is a story
that will never lose its up-to-dateness .
and especially this movie does the job pretty well .
of course it is cheesy at time ,
but very touching as well.jodie foster 's performance is striking ,
and it shows
that she is really a natural born actress
who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.do not miss this one .
