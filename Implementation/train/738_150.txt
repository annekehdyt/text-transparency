watching john cassavete film ,
opening night 
i was reminded of something
that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience
in being a creator of art or acting .
he referred to an example of 
say ,
if he ran over a dog
while on his way to act in a play
that it would not be the end of his life
but that it would affect him ,
and that ,
without a doubt ,
he would have to ing that experience with him on stage
even if it was a light comedy .
`` otherwise 
''
as he said ,
`` what am i doing ? ''
i could not help but think of his word
when watching gena rowland 's character 
myrtle gordon ,
who for almost a whole week
or so goes through a very similar scenario .
there is more to this in cassavete ' film 
of course ,
since it is about how the theater works around a star actress ,
what emotion and human nature mean
when looking at playing a character ,
and how one lives
when all one has
( like myrtle gordon )
is the theater.near the beginning of the film ,
after exiting a performance 
myrtle is signing autographs
and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle .
it is a touching little moment ,
but it does not last
as she has to get in the car
( pouring rain and all ) .
she then watches in horror as the girl ,
who stood right next to the car
as it drove off ,
gets hit by another car in an auto accident .
she is not sure really what happened ,
but then finds out the next day
that in fact the girl did die from the hit .
from then on she is sort of stunned by this even after she thinks
it is out of her system .
at first this shows in small way ,
like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor
( played by cassavete )
and can not seem to stand being hit -
she blames it on the lack of depth in the character
( the writer :
`` what do you think
the play lacks ? ''
`` hope 
''
says myrtle )
- but then nancy starts to show up to her 
an apparition
that to myrtle is all to real ,
until she is suddenly gone.cassavete 
as in the past film 
is after a search for what it means to have emotion ,
to really feel about something
and feel it 
or the lack thereof ,
and how it affects other around the person .
this is not exactly new ground for rowland ,
who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence
( in that case
because of alcohol ) ,
nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara ,
who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie .
but the actor express everything essential to their character in every scene ;
cassavete does not tell them how to get from a to b in a scene ,
and he does not need to .
there is a mood in a cassavete film
that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work .
you know myrtle 
for example 
should be content somehow ,
even if it is not with the plot .
but she is haunted ,
and is unsatisfied with her character 's lack of depth and the tone of the play
( `` aging ,
who goes to see that ? ''
she asks the playwright ) ,
and it starts to affect those around her too.the question soon becomes though not what is the usual .
a conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'will
she be able to go on stage ,
will the show go on ? '
this is not important for cassavete ,
even if it is there ,
as is the question 'will
she be alright ? '
perhaps going through such a grueling play
as `` the second woman '' could help her work out her personal demon and her losing her grip on reality
( seeing sara and attacking her in front of total stranger ,
who wonder
what the hell is going on ) ?
or will the play 's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her ?
the depths rowland makes with her character are intense and harrowing ,
and that
it is expected does not mean it is any duller than woman under the influence- if anything ,
it is just as good
as that film at being honest about a person in this profession ,
and consequently the other performance are just as true 
from gazarra to nancy
played by a subtle laura johnson .
cassavete answer to his own posed question are not easy.one of the real thrill of opening night ,
along with seeing great actor performing an amazing script ,
is to see cassavete take on the theater the way
he does .
we see the play performed-
and it is apparently a real play-
and we only know
slightly what it is about .
when we see the actor on the stage performing it ,
we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on ( relationship scuffling and affair and the occasional slap and domestic violence )
and the improvisation of the actor .
i wondered
watching
how much really was improvised ,
how much cassavete allowed for the other actor to do in the scene
where myrtle starts to go loopy or 
in the climax 
is completely smashed .
he is on the stage 
too ,
so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand
and let what would happen
happen.it is funny 
startling 
chilling 
and edge-of-your-seat stuff 
some of the best theater-on-film scene ever put in a movie ,
and we see the line between actor on stage 
actor on film 
actor with actor 
blur together wonderfully .
opening night is a potent drama
that is full of frank talk about death and madness 
reality and fiction ,
where the love is between person ,
and really 
finally 
what does 'acting ' mean ?
