as part of our late 1950s vocabulary 
we well knew the ponderosa 
little joe 
hoss 
ben cartwright 
etc .
on that great show `` bonanza .
`` it came saturday night
and everyone was glued to the television set .
this was a real show
depicting family value .
there may have been a weekly crisis ,
but it was the strong family atmosphere
that pulled everyone together.lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family .
his word depicted wisdom .
we often were left to wonder
that ben cartwright 
a widower 
must have been the best of husband to that poor wife of his who had died .
he reared wonderful sons.naturally ,
we all wondered
why pernell robert left the show .
the show was a gold mine and robert surrendered load of money
when he departed .
his career never took off
as he was associated as a cartwright son .
he should have tried to get back into the series .
he certainly lost a bonanza
by dropping out .
