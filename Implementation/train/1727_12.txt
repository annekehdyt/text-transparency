this is the only david zucker movie
that does not spoof anything the first of its kind .
the funniest movie of 98 with night at the roxbury right behind
but i did not think
there is something about mary was funny so
that does not count except for the frank and bean thing
he he .
do not listen to the critic especially roger ebert
he does not know
solid entertainment just look at his reviews.anyway see
it you wont
be dissapionted
