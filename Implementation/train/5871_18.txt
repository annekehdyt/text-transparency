this movie is phoniness incarnate 
a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale .
the fakeness of the accent as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pant are just staggering .
yank 
although the real scotland may be just as colourful ,
if you ever go
there do not expect to be given much of a the chance
to `` dance out '' controversy with the local .
also 
do not attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing.there are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scene ,
but the plot is far too cheesy and linear ,
and the dialogue is often too weak .
i also doubt
whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century scottish village in the boondock rather than gay new york city .
maybe it was not such a big sacrifice
for that priest to have left brigadoon ,
maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a christopher streed day-parade in scotland would look like on lsd .
other than that i would only recommend it to hollywood muscial completist .
