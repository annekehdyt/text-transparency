as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9
( mbb bo 105 )
flight scene in this movie .
one of the few disappointment was the ews 39 jammer pod 
in this case an inert rb 75
( maverick )
missile painted black with the letter `` ews 39 '' in white along the side .
real jammer pod definitely do not look like that ,
at least not the one i have seen.but apart from that ,
it is an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending
( the last minute ) .
anyone interested in seeing various swedish military unit ,
including the now-legendary ssg ,
on film should see this one .
