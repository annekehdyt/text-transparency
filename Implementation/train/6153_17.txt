`` ambushed '' is no ordinary action flick .
it is much to bad to be ordinary .
one man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing .
the other man fires one round and fells the man with the greater fire power
without so much as a nick from the hail of lead raining down on him .
guess
which one is the good guy .
duh .
such is `` ambushed '' through and through .
not a good action flick 
not a good drama 
not a good movie ,
`` ambushed '' fail on all level
with it is cast of b-movie veteran mechanically going through the motion almost
as though they know
they are making a real loser .
not recommended for anyone .
