simply terrible !
why would not you use actual actor ?
look 
this has to stop !
stop using non-actor !
if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low-budget film ...
please for the love of god use real actor !
most will work for free ... take advantage of that !
now back to my comment ... anyway ,
the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and was not funny on any level .
as for the quality ... in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what ?
it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his .
well 
i assume
the only audience for this film are person with a gore fetish ...
and it was not even good gore .
