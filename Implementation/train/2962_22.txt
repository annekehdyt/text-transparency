i had no idea
what this film was about or even knew
that it existed until about 1 month ago
when i stumbled upon
when i was searching for other film
that stared dominic monaghan .
i thought
this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper
and what his/her mind may be going through in the hour
that they spend awake
when the rest of the world around them is asleep ,
it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom ... ... .i believe
that even though this film you can not buy anywhere
( well i have never seen it anywhere )
you must see it
if you ever get the chance
because it will really make you think about those person around us
that can not sleep
and have to suffer night
after night of not been able to sleep
or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall
it was an interesting film of good substance .
