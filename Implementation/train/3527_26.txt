monoa woman turns the table on a would-be rapist
when he mounts an assault in her home ,
and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police ,
in which case he could be released and attack her again.exploitation fan
who might be expecting another rough 'n ' ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman
( 1978 )
will almost certainly be disappointed by extremity .
true 
farrah fawcett 's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assault
before gaining the upper hand on her attacker
( a suitably slimy jame russo ) ,
but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m. young take these unpleasant scene only so far
before unveiling the dilemma
which informs the moral core of this production .
would their final solution hold up in a court of law ?
maybe ...
based on a stage play
which reportedly left its actor battered and uised after every performance ,
the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative
and rely instead on a confined setting for the main action .
acing and technical credit are fine ,
though fawcett 's overly subdued performance will not play effectively to viewer
who might be relying on her
to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation .
