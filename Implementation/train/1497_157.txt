timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king .
timon decide to go back before the beginning ,
to when the story really began .
so they go back .
way back .
back even before simba was born .
back to timon 's old home
which was mile away from pride rock .
a clan of meerkat burrowed underground
to hide from hyena .
the worst digger in the clan was a pompous ,
self-centered meerkat named timon .
his mother took pity on him
but uncle max just shook his head .
mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty ;
timon had dream of a bigger
and better place out there somewhere .
just then 
hyena shenzi 
bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max .
that did it .
the other meerkat just wanted timon to go away
while timon took it upon himself to leave .
so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off .
he did not get very far
before he started getting homeick .
just then he met rafiki ,
who taught him to look beyond what he sees .
timon had no clue
what that meant so
he continued on and met a warthog named pumbaa ,
who was all alone due to a flatulence problem .
timon and pumbaa join up then ,
but timon declared them acquaintance 
rather than friend .
they soon arrive at pride rock
where all the zeas 
antelopes 
wildebeest 
rhinoceros 
giraffe 's 
elephant and many other plain animal had gathered .
what was going on ?
timon did not care .
they pressed on .
timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock
lifting into the air something
he could not see .
just then all the animal took a bow .
was this
to honor the birth of the new king ?
no 
pumbaa had passed gas
and the animal were bowing to cover their nose ;
timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new home ,
but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyena or a large stampede of wildebeest !
pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream .
when they reach land ,
timon decide to give up .
but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise .
it was beautiful :
tree and water fall as far
as the eye could see .
timon named the place after a strange phrase
he learned from rafiki :
hakuna matata .
timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzard one afternoon
when they suddenly run into simba .
they take him under their wing and become father figure .
they teach him the art of bug eating and belching contest .
pretty soon 
a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest .
simba won ,
leaving timon deathly ill. then one day ,
simba 's childhood friend nala arrived .
timon and pumbaa just knew
she had eak up the friendhip .
suddenly 
simba runs away .
nala and pumbaa race after him 
but not timon .
he chose to stay at `` hakuna matata '' by himself ,
until rafiki `` talked '' some sense into him ,
so he joins his friend at pride rock .
timon 's mother and uncle max arrive then .
while simba battle scar ,
mother and max dig a large hole
to trap hyena shenzi 
bonzai and ed in .
it worked .
scar is soon flung down the same hole
where he is devoured by the hyena .
then all is well .
mother 
uncle max and the rest of the meerkat go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise
that is hakuna matata .
back to the present 
timon and pumbaa finish the movie
when suddenly mother ,
uncle max 
simba and rafiki want to watch it again .
so do mickey mouse 
donald duck 
goofy 
snow white 
the seven dwarf 
dumbo 
peter pan 
the lost boy 
mad hatter 
march hare 
genie 
aladdin 
and jasmine .
well 
i must say
that the lion king 1 1/2 was not as good
as i had hoped .
it was too ridiculous and silly .
the original lion king was a masterpiece .
it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in .
this one was just silly
and made a mockery of it .
i swear 
sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed .
they are overplayed to the point of no longer
being funny 
just annoying .
the original voice cast is back :
nathan lane as timon 
ernie sabella as pumbaa 
matthew broddrick as adult simba 
whoopi goldberg as shenzi 
cheech marin as bonzai 
jim cumming as ed 
robert guillame as rafiki .
new to the cast are julie kavner of tv 's
( too )
long running series the simpson as timon 's mom and jerry stiller as uncle max .
so anyway 
this movie is not the lion king iii ,
and it is not ii
because there already is a ii .
it takes place right
after part i and part ii is a way away .
hence 
it is 1 1/2 .
in conclusion 
i do not recommend this to die hard lion king fan
because it is far too ridiculous and frivilous .
however the kid will love it so i recommend it to them .
i hope this will also be the last lion king movie .
two is enough .
`` the lion king 1 1/2 '' .
what we have come to expect from disney sequel makers.-
