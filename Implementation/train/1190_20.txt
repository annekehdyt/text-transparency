director samuel fuller concocts a illiant visual set-up :
cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman 's purse ;
it turns out
she is a courier for the communist ,
and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police .
the film noir formula is all its glory
-- before the ingredient became clich\u00e9s --
including waterfront locale 
floozy 
saxophone on the soundtrack 
and one hell of a climactic fistfight .
performance by richard widmark and jean peter are right on target ,
and the smart 
sharp script is quite colorful .
fabulous thelma ritter received an oscar nomination for knockout
supporting role as a `` professional stoolie '' .
exciting 
atmospheric 
tough as nail .
