i would not say
this is a *bad* movie .
unfortunately for me 
i get the feeling
that the more you know about fencing ,
the worse it gets simply due to the fact
that it becomes totally unrealistic .
i have been fencing
since i was 14 year old ,
and this movie portrays it very poorly .
f. murray aaham is good
( and appears to have some fencing background ) ,
but most of the other actor
-- especially the student --
just seem to be lost .
