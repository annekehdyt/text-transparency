this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,
except that `` party on the left is now party on the right . ''
like the original 
this movie rails against a federal government
which oversteps its bound with regard to personal liberty .
it is a warning
of how tenuous our political liberty are in an era of an over-zealous 
and over-powerful federal government .
kowalski serve as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,
where the us government 
with the cooperation of the mainstream medium 
threw around word like `` white supremacist '' and `` right wing extremist as well as trumped-up drug charge
to aidge the most fundamental of its ' citizen right 
with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .
that message is so non-pc ,
i am stunned
that this film could be made - at least
not without inging the federal government via the ir down on the maker
like they did to juanita broderick 
katherine prudhomme 
the western journalism center 
and countless other
who dared to speak out .
`` live free or die '' is the motto on jason priestly 's hat
as he illiantly portrays `` the voice 
''
and that sums up the dangerous
( to some )
message of this film .
