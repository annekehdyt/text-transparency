come on ! ! !
they did that on purpose ! !
two of my current fave on tv
( meloni from `` oz '' and `` l and o-svu '' and janel from `` west wing '' )
hook up for a nice little sleeper/character study .
plot 's nothing fancy ,
but the acting is right on the mark .
tim busfield shows up for some neat bit .
worth a look .
