the single worst film i have ever seen in a theater .
i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 ,
and it blew my mind
that this film was accepted to a festival .
it was an interesting premise ,
and seemed like it could go somewhere ,
but just fell apart every time
it tried to do anything .
first of all ,
if you are going to do a musical ,
find someone with musical talent .
the music consisted of cheesy piano
playing
that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room
they were filming .
the lyric were terribly written ,
and
when they were not obvious rhyme ,
they were groan-inducing rhyme
that showed
how far they were stretching
to try to make this movie work .
and you would think
you would find person
who could sing
when making a musical 
right ?
not in this case .
luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time ,
but when they did sing it made me cringe .
especially when they attempted to sing in harmony .
and that just addresses the music .
some of the acting was pretty good ,
but a lot of the dialog was terrible 
as well as most of the scene .
they obviously did not have enough coverage on the scene ,
or they just had a bad editor ,
because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choice
while cutting the film .
at least the director was willing to admit
that no one wanted the script
until they added the hook
of making it a musical .
i hope
the investor make sure
someone can write music
before making the same mistake again .
