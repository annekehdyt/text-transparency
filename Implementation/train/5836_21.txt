i went to see this film yesterday
and although i did not have high hope for this film ,
i was still bitterly disappointed !
i actually can not believe i spent 96 minute of my life watching this film ...
it was that bad ! ! !
the storyline was disgraceful
and the acting was terrible
( even though it had big name such as uma thurman in it ) .
this film heavily relied on its special effect ...
but they personally had no effect on me .
i honestly
wished id never watched it
and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film .
it is a total waste of money
and you will only end up
being disappointed afterward .
my advice is to save your money ,
go shopping 
treat yourself ,
just do not go
and see this film ... you will live to regret it lol !
