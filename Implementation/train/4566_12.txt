the alarmist is so abysmally scripted
that you have think to yourself why on earth
did an up
and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it .
it has to be one of the weakest plot i
have ever seen
and without any humour at all ,
it borders on the ink of tedious .
it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion
which appears to only happen
because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner .
stay away ! .
