kid found as a baby in the garbage
and raised at a martial art academy has a knack for sinking basket .
with the help of the man
who found him
he gets in to college
and is promoted to the championship
as he searches for his real parent .
infinitely better in piece action comedy is a real mess as a whole .
it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer ,
but the comedy is scatter shot ,
its focus wander more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso .
i kept asking `` what am i watching '' .
i watched it from start to finish
and i still do not know what the hell happened .
its a shame
since there are some great action scene ,
some amusing joke and the occasional moment 
but nothing ,
none of it ever comes together ,
i would take a pass .
