this is one of the few movie
released about a `` what if '' type of situation
that made me think .
it was amazing to hear them speak to each other 
and reminisce about all the wonderful
( and not so wonderful )
thing
that happened between them .
i actually think
that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie imply ,
and they actually made peace with each other .
those are good memory for every fan to hang onto ,
and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish .
what an amazing movie this was .
the comedic aspect of the movie were wonderful .
to think
that they were together to patch thing up between them in such a way
is a comforting thought to person
who wish
they had a chance
to clear the air with someone
they did not get to .
to see john as such a caring ,
laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash
that was spoken about him ...
