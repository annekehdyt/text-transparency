somehow they summed up the 60 's 
ten year
that radically changed our country 
in four hour .
and what a painful four hour it was .
they trivilized the major event and happening
and they `` claimed ''
it was about two family yet
you barely saw the african-american family .
if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash .
what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family
you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many way ,
but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country .
and the second family was such a non-factor .
they devoted maybe five or six scene total to this family .
that poor son ... please nbc 
do not make any movie about any other era ... .leave
that to pbs and the history channel
