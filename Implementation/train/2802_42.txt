the statistic in this movie were well researched .
there is no doubt about it !
al gore certainly presents his case very well
and it is no wonder
that this movie got the praise
that it got .
al gore is certainly quite an actor .
he sounds so concerned .
but action speak louder than word !
throughout this movie 
there are political tidbit
and reference to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.jimmy carter ,
unlike al gore 
is a man of integrity
who not only talks the talk ,
but walks the walk as well .
when carter thought
we needed
to conserve energy ,
he turned down the thermostat in the white house
and got warm by wearing a sweater.al gore
tells us
that we have to conserve energy
and claim
that we are creating global warming
while he travels around in his own private jet .
how much energy does his jet use
and how much more pollution does his jet create ?
how much energy does it take to heat gore 's swimming pool behind his mansion ?
it would be nice if we could conserve electricity
by using smaller appliance
and making it a point
to turn off anything
that is not being used .
but if we did ,
the power company would react to a 50 % reduction of energy
by calling it a `` 50 % loss in revenue '' and recouping their loss
by raising the rate by 50 % .
so `` just turning it off '' would not be a very good idea.this movie is a veiled appeal
to allow big goivernment to take control of everything 
in the name of saving planet earth ,
that is .
