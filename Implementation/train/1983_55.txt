the first film ever made .
worker streaming from a factory 
some cycling 
most walking ,
moving right or left .
along with mely 
the lumiere are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with mely begin narrative fiction 
cinema 
fantasy 
artifice 
spectacle ; with the lumiere pure 
unadorned 
observation .
the truth .
there are many intellectual
who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.but consider this short again .
there is nothing 'objective ' about it .
the film is full of action
- a static ,
inhuman scene burst into life 
activity ,
and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured 
decentred from the back
to right or left
( but never 
of course 
the front ,
where the camera is ) .
and yet the camera stands stock still ,
contains the energy 
the possible subversion 
subordinates it to its will .
the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention ,
but it will be used for conservative purpose -
to map out the world ,
edit it ,
restrict it ,
limit it.worse is the historical reality of the film .
these factory worker are lumiere employee .
the boss are spying on their worker 
the unseen eye
regarding his faceless minion .
the film therefore describes two type of imprisonment .
behind the gate 
the worker are confined in their workplace .
the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom 
escape ,
but they face another wall ,
the fourth wall 
further confining them .
the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance 
an image of unseen 
all-seeing authority entrapping its servant .
a frightening 
all too prophetic movie .
