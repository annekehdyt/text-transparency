i will never forget this film or the event
that lead up to jonetown in guyana .
it just seems so tragic but needs
to be told .
power boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev .
jim jone from obscurity until total madness .
it would have won him an academy award easily
if it was released in the movie theater .
it is the kind of mini-series
you will not forget .
you will not forget the image of the cult 's utality 
control ,
and obsessiveness of it is leader .
his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world
to destroy what he considered to be paradise .
the mass suicide is horrifying 
almost unreal to anybody 's imagination
as to why so many person
( 900+ )
went willingly or resisted jone ' order .
they do not make mini series like these anymore
where we are left with out mouth open and hungry to know what happened to the other .
