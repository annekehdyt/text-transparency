i do not watch much television
and came across this show .
reality show ?
i sure hope
this is not for real .
if i was a man
and had such a nag
and was married to someone so snotty ,
it would be ground for divorce .
i think
she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person
they love .
that is one thing
that is wrong with our world now ,
so many person in bad relationship ,
selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another .
it is self sacrificing and not something
that should be on merritt .
that does not give one a very good feeling ,
to watch what should be in private counseling .
if his personality on the show is for real ,
then he deserves someone much better
that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him
for who he is .
is this show a reality
or made up for rating ? ? ? ?
i really would like to know .
sincerely 
gb
