despite the overwhelming cult
following for this sad `` documentary 
''
i must admit to having cordially loathed the film
which struck our party
as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative .
that said ,
after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it ,
one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hand .
one suspects
that those many of us
who actively suffered through the film
may have had any campy delight its crueler fan
enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion
that too many of us - or those
we know -
are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad woman depicted
who live in and contribute to a squalor
they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.the film leaves the viewer desperately wondering
how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and 
unlike the musical 
offers no cautionary clue or explanation 
only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight .
this soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version
( hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable )
all the more remarkable .
act ii is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely ,
setting the sad inmate ' plight to music ,
raises the human tragedy to art .
even more important 
this act is preceded by a fine act i
where we meet the woman
before their decent into mutually enabled madness ,
and are offered hint
how their isolated purgatory came about .
in short 
everything which the film is lacking.to the filmmaker ' credit
( or their successor ) ,
the excellent criterion dvd release includes out-take and bonus material
that partially redeem the main film -
behind the scene photographs 
interview and commentary -
filling in some of the blank spot
the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression .
they can not make the amateurish film itself satisfying ,
but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible .
ultimately though 
it is only the remarkable stage piece
inspired by and drawn from it by book writer doug wright 
composer scott frankel and lyricist michael korie
which raises the rating of the original grey garden above a single
( generous )
star .
