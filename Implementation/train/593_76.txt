this film opened to poor showing in the first few week .
then meena kumari died and it just ought the crowds rolling in .
song on all india radio 
especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time ,
despite recognising their beauty !
yes 
it did take all those year
to make .
this was because the marriage was a very unhappy
one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty
finding the money
to make the film ;
looking at the sumptous set and costume 
not surprising ! !
not only does meena kumari age and fall ill
but listen carefully to lata 's voice .
inhi logon ne has her 50 's younger voice
while song
that were re-recorded like chalo dildar chalo
show clear development .
i only wish
someone would find the ghulam mohammad song
that were not included in the film ,
because of changing fashion
that called for fewer though slightly song
and publish them .
lata in a recent interview
( 2007 )
rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composer
she had ever worked with 
apart from madan mohan
( a great personal friend ) .
notice also that you hardly see the actor at all in the chalo dildar song 
very unusual .
there is only a ief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance
and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari .
kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the star and moon .
any other film 
this song would have had close-up of both of them.as for this being the finest film ever ,
i would beg to differ .
it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema 
in no particular order 
film like barsaat
( old ) ,
devdas
( older version ) 
bandini 
do bigha zameen 
garam hava 
dastak 
guddi 
aan 
pyasa 
kagaz ke phool 
sahib bibi aur ghulam 
kabuliwallah 
abhimaan 
guide 
sujatha 
bombay ka babu 
daag 
parineeta
( old ) ,
umrao jaan 
etc .
etc .
and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful score from barsat ki raat to naya daur 
teesri manzil 
mahal 
aag 
jugnu 
anand 
mera naam joker :
the list is really endless !
so enjoy pakeezah
but do not miss out on any of the above ...
