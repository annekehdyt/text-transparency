this police procedural is no worse than many other of its era and better than quite a few .
obviously it is following in the step of `` dragnet '' and `` naked city ''
but emerges as an enjoyable programmer .
the best thing
about it is the unadorned look
it provides into a world
now long gone ... the lower class new york of the late 40's/early 50 's .
here it is in all its seedy glory 
from the old-school tattoo parlor to the cheap hotel to the greasy spoon .
these old police film are like travelogue to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody
who dislikes the sanitized ,
soulless cityscape of today.also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts scientific aspect
of solving the crime ... in this case ,
the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car .
our main hero 
detective tobin and corrigan 
do the footwork ,
but without the tedious and painstaking effort of the `` lab boy '' ,
they had get nowhere .
although the technology is not in the same league ,
the cop here use the dogged persistence of a c.s.i .
investigator to track down their man.the way
some reviewer have written about this movie ,
you think
it would have been directed by ed wood
and acted by extra from his movie .
what bosh !
i enjoyed john mile
as the gangly ex-marine turned cop tobin ...
he had a happy-go-lucky ,
easy-going approach to the role
that is a welcome change from the usual stone-faced histrionic of most movie cop of the period .
patricia barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend
who helps solve the crime .
walter kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective corrigan .
i rather liked the chemistry of these two
and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic `` dragnet '' approach.the mystery itself is not too deep
and the final chase and shoot-out certainly will not rank amongst the classic of crime cinema ,
but during it is ief running time 
`` the tattooed stranger '' more than held my interest .
