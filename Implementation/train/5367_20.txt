dick tracy is easily the best comic book
based movie
made to date .
the movie has the same feel as the comic book ,
staying true to the color scheme .
the batman series has climbed 
fallen 
climbed and fallen again .
dick tracy has true staying power as something
that both adult and child can enjoy .
the good guy triumph over evil ,
without blood and gore to get the point across .
al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy caprice and madonna is memorable as breathless .
but the best job by far is warren beatty
who just epitomizes dick tracy
just as he did with clyde barrow .
i can not wait
until it comes out on dvd on april 2 
2002 ,
my tape is wearing thin .
