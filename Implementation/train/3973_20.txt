i can not believe
that this movie was ever created .
i think
at point the director is trying to make it an artistic piece
but this just makes it worse .
the zombie look like they applied too much eye makeup .
the zombie are only in the movie for a few minute .
finally 
there are maybe five or six zombie total 
definitely not a nation .
the best part of the movie ,
if there is one is definitely the credit
because the painful experience was finally finished .
again to reiterate other user comment ,
the voodoo priestess are strange
and do not make much sense in the whole movie .
also 
there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl
that just does not make sense at all .
it is never explained .
