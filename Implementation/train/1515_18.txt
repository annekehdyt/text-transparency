at a panel discussion
that i attended
after viewing this film ,
the filmmaker stated
that one should look at this not as a movie
but a provoker of thought .
well 
the only thought
that were provoked from me were of the time wasted
watching the movie .
the gimmick of the film
( documentary style 
futuristic setting )
served as distraction of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate .
this film illustrates the problem
when person try to use film
as a platform for their political view - usually a very boring movie
that preaches to the choir .
