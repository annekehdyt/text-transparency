it is often only after year pass
that we can look back and see those star
who are truly star .
as that french film critic ,
whose name escapes me ,
said :
`` there is no garbo .
there is no dietrich .
there is only louise brook '' ;
and there is 
thank heaven !
louise brook !
this is the third of her european masterpiece .
but it is also an exceptional film for being one 
if not the 
first french talkie ,
for following a script
written by famed ren\u00e9 clair ,
for reportedly being finished
( the direction ,
that is ) by georg pabst ,
and for incorporating the voice of edith piaf before she was well known !
so much talent
working on and in a film ,
how could not it turn out to be a masterpiece ? !
and that is what this film is .
it is a shame louise brook was blackballed by hollywood
when she came back to the state
-- so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside !
in the film ,
in addition to getting to watch louise brook in action ,
it is great to see picture of paris ca .
1930 and to hear piaf 's young voice .
i never get tired of this film !
