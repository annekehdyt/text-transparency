it appears even the director does not like this film ,
but for me i think
he is being a bit harsh on himself.sure
it is not perfect ,
but there are some atmospheric shot ,
and the story is good enough
to keep you interested throughout.it is shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village
which adds to the atmosphere
as well.if you like horror film shot in england ,
give it a go.i have just seen a trailer for this director latest film 'the devil 's chair '
which looks quite amazing.there are not enough english horror film for me ,
so any
that come along deserve our attention ,
and this one is not as bad
as you may think
