now 
it would be some sort of clich\u00e9
if i began with the bit about the title ,
so i will wait on that .
first 
this movie made me wonder
why kid do stupid thing like wander around in labs and eak bottle .
then i realized it ,
this is a movie with a message ,
that message is beat kid
and thing like this will not happen .
thing like what you ask ?
thing like a giant insectish monster growing up
and causing a bit of mayhem
before dying in the typical `` kill the monster indirectly '' fashion .
now ,
as promised ... blue monkey ... has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind .
now it snot like i was cheated or anything .
the picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front
chasing some screaming nurse .
that kinda happened but i wanted apes !
having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few night
before
( half drunk on cask and creame 's andy mind you )
i was in the mood for more monkey hijack 80 's style .
not so much .
if you like snow boarding apes or blue thing
this movie is not for you .
if you like bug and good reason
to hit kid 
rent this .
