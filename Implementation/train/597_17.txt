arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire
and is attracted to person 'below him ' in social standing -
he pays for a hooker in the opening scene
and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter.he drink quite a lot too ,
and sometimes he is driving
while drinking 
too ,
which of course is not funny 
ever .
the movie is great
but behind the comedy is some reality 
too .
john gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen
and created a character for the age .
talk about deserving an oscar .
moore and minnelli have their moment ,
but its gielgud as `` hobson '' you will remember the most .
