i was willing to go with the original _cruel intentions._
it went along with the plot
and stayed true to the character of one of my favorite story .
however 
this movie was 
in my opinion 
a crummy rehash
with essentially the same story line and no clear character choice .
i did not honestly care what happened to any of them .
the strongest part of the original story
( les liason 
not ci )
is the character and their interaction 
not the event themselves .
i was not clear until i read the imdb
that this movie was meant to be a prequel ,
especially since the title includes a number `` 2 
''
i expected a sequel ,
but then determined
that it must be a companion piece .
over all 
i must say
that this movie read ,
to me at least 
like a soft porn version of les liason .
i was not impressed .
