grey garden is a world unto itself .
edith and little edie live in near total isolation ,
eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their
( apparently )
shared bedroom .
cat loll about while mother edith insult her daughter 's elocution .
this is a tennessee williams play come to life
and should inspire screenwriter and playwright ,
as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 % real.the situation in the house reminds me
exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade
( other than that they were poor and clean ) .
they would bicker all day ,
grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past
while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunity with man 
work ,
and self-expression.this film is a must-see for anyone
writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind .
it is sad and voyeuristic ,
but the filmmaker did an amazing job
getting the edy comfortable enough
to expose themselves so recklessly .
it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special
considering the context
-- remnant of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .
