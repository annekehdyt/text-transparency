this story about three woman is a very sensitive study about :
muri\u00ebl
( charlotte van den eynde )
the youngest 
laura
( els dotterman )
who is about 37 and martha
( frieda pittor )
the oldest who is the mother of muri\u00ebl .
they live together in the same building .
they have different expectation of life .
the vital laura wants a child .
muri\u00ebl comes from a village
and wants to change her life in brussel .
martha dream about her youth
when she was a young girl .
in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instance an accident -
which could dramatize this story .
as time goes on ,
you discover
that the director doroth\u00e9e van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three woman and nothing more .
this movie is disappointing
because you expect the woman
to learn from their experience
which is not the case ,
so one is left with a feeling of emptiness .
