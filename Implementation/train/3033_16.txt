after all these year i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making .
the interview with the many participant from all country set this apart from any other project .
it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian
( ken burn ? )
take on this topic and try to gather information from veteran
before they are all gone .
with modern technology
to improve old archival footage and lot of information
that has been unearthed since 1974
when the world at war was produced ,
an updated version of this series would be welcome .
the history channel has made some fine show dealing with many aspect of wwii
but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original .
if you are interested in this era
do not miss this series .
it is required viewing .
