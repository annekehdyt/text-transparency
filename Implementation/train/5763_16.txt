the class is a comedy series
that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates.i like the idea of the show .
that is why it saddens me that the class is not funny ,
even though it has the obvious potential .
it is not enough corky 
just dorky .
( haha . )
this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch line .
also some actor have difficulty with timing.most inventively written character are the twin kat and lina warbler
( lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh )
but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show .
on the other hand
the character i
find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used-to-be- couple duncan and nicole.what bother me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent
( even though by a non-respectable character 
but anyway ) .
