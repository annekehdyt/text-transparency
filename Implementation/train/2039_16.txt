this is movie is very touching .
i do not care what person
say about this movie ,
this is a very good movie .
the performance by amitabh bachchan 's role has the dying
father is great ,
because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur .
the supporting role of shefali shetty
who played the role of sumitra thakur
was magnificent .
priyanka chopra was good in her small role
she had in the movie .
ragpal yadav as the ain-dead servant and boman irani
as the show-off father-in law have a very good connection
and the comedy scene 's were hilarious .
the direction is very good .
