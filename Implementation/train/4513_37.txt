`` the last hard man '' is a typical western for the 70 's .
most of them seem to be inspired by sam peckinpah .
also this one ,
but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil
and this can be obviously shown in many scene .
imo the beginning is very good .
in a certain way mclaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness .
in the third part there are some illogical flaw
and i complain a bit about charlton heston .
he has to play an old ex-lawman
named sam burgade
but he is in a fantastic physical shape .
i never got the feeling
that he really has problem to climb on a horse or on a rock .
for me he did not looks very motivated
as he usual do in most of his epic movie .
same goes to the beautiful barbara hershey
who is playing the sheriff 's daughter .
maybe both had trouble with the director
or were unhappy with their role .
hershey and coburn are not showing their best
but they are still good .
if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam burgade ?
also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role .
on the other hand there is jame coburn as outlaw zach provo .
coburn is a really great villain in this one .
he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness .
his role and his acting is the best of the movie.landscape and shootout are terrific .
the shooting scene are bloody
and the violence looks realistic .
zach provo and his gang had some gory and violent scene .
what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie .
i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar .
overall it is an entertaining western flick .
not a great movie but above the average
because of a great coburn 
a very good beginning and some gory and violent scene .
