as usual 
i went to watch this movie for a.r.rahman .
otherwise 
the film is no good .
rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film
is it would be successful .
but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure .
after this he delivered a hit with chandramukhi .
i am eagerly
waiting for his forth coming shivaji.i have read the other user 's comment on rajni .
i found it interesting
as the user is from tn too .
rajni is one actor
who acts ,
i think 
from his heart not from his mind .
he is not a method actor like kamal hasan .
i think
we need to appreciate rajni for his strong going at his age.any way ,
i need to fill 10 line for this comment ...
so wish u good luck rajni ... ... ... ..
