zero day leads you to think ,
even re-think why two boys/young man would do what
they did -
commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmate .
it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode
of being for two human
who have decided to withdraw from common civility
in order
to define their own/mutual world via coupled destruction.it
is not a perfect movie
but given what money/time the filmmaker and actor had -
it is a remarkable product .
in term of explaining the motive and action of the two young suicide/murderer
it is better than 'elephant ' - in term of being a film
that gets under our 'rationalistic ' skin
it is a far ,
far better film than almost anything
you are likely to see .
flawed but honest with a terrible honesty .
