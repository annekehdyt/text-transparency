as in amelie 
recent french film seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant ,
centered on a female finding her one true love .
in this case 
desperation leads to a convict ,
which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype .
clever and surprising story in many way ,
except that the female is there to support the male.for those of us
that do not speak french ,
the subtitle are a little quick 
but not unreasonable.the soundtrack ,
as seems to be increasingly the case with european film 
is great and in perfect sync with the film 's variation .
nothing seems forced .
visually 
it reminds me of various urban horror movie .
there is a wes craven in chicago feel to it .
