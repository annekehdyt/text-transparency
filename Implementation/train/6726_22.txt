this was a really cool movie .
it just goes to prove
that you do not need silly litle thing like continuity and script
to make a movie .
it traverses continent in second ,
person get shot
and nothing happen to them ,
sword set on fire 
samuari fight on sinking galleon ,
david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy
and john rhys davy is just the dude .
i enjoyed this movie
but i like s**t movie 
this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie
that just kicks ass .
if you like battlefield earth you will love this film 
its swashbuckling 
its fast 
its silly 
its samuaraitastic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
! it also looks as if
it was made in 1972
