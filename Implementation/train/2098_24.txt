i have never understood the appeal of garbo .
she always comes across in her film
as stuck up 
not all that alluring ,
and that annoying voice
that could have drowned out the tuba section .
she was also a very limited actress ,
like glorium swanson far better off left in the silent era .
in this her last film 
her performance is very average and even unassured .
she tries hard
but it all comes to nothing
because the script is even worse
than her acting.a would be screwball romcom
that is never once believable
and never gets off the ground
( even though melvyn dougla manages to get airborne in the skiing scene ,
which are really the only amusing thing here )
.there was potential
but the script fails in almost every department 
wasting every actor in it .
dougla and garbo had good enough chemistry together
but this one is not even a spot on ninotchka ,
which i also found to be extremely overrated .
