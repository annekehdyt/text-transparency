no reason to bother renting this flick .
from the opening credit on 
i knew i was in trouble.it was filmed
as though it was a soft porn movie ,
but there really is not anything erotic about it .
the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing 
but only to a point.boring sex scene 
bad plot ,
and cameos by ed begley jr. and rosanna arquette are not enough
to save this film .
