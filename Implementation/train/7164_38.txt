with a title like that ,
it is above
and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me .
granted 
there is a few decently sleazy momant and a little gore 
but the way
in which the movie was shot
and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse `` shock '' tactic ...
the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road .
he and his abetting other are imprisoned up until the other eak out and arrange to meet his girlfriend out in the wood .
he ends up forcing her into a house
where they screw
and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guy in the basemant .
the heavily drugged captive consist of her old boyfriend
who raped her 
a `` grabby '' neighbor 
and her sexually aasive boss .
he explains to her that he is going to kill them all .
she winds up killing him
and then turning her focus towards the man
( or pig )
whom she tortures
and kill ,
herself ... most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh ! t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild .
the best scene is a graphic oom handle masturbation
followed by some painful man-rape ... surely ,
`` i spit on your corpse 
i p ! ss on your grave '' was intended as an unofficial sequel to `` i spit on your grave '' -
based on 
mainly the title ,
and a reference the main character gives -
suggesting
her mother was camille keaton .
i personally consider
that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion !
this movie is a boring 
amateurish mess
that strives for shock but failed miserably ...
