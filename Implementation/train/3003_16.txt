i totally disagree.i thought
that this was a great movie for kid.dawn well from gilligan island ,
and promise shown of a barely
then known dana plato.it was disneylike
and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no
it was not scary
and was not meant to be.i wont ruin the ending.but
it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kid character were great and i did not know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kid
than you say
the fact
that these kid were expert fisherman
is very central to the plot especially initially.it
also helps them out of a jam towards
the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i
think
it clocks in at under 95 minute
