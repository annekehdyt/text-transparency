you know you are in trouble
when the film your watching has numerous alternate title .
generally it means
that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various market .
such a turkey is the brain machine
which has seven different title.its about some super secret government project
that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read person
but instead it drives person to kill each other or themselves 
or something like that .
its filled with b level tv actor
sitting in paneled room with lawn chair
trying to act a script
that makes almost no sense.it a turkey of the untastey kind .
avoid it .
