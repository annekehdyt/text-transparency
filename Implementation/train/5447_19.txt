basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970 's classic kitsch horror 'death line '
which ironically was like this cobbler ,
also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station.making good use of the now disused jubilee line platform at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych ,
this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnel preying on the lost passenger
who have missed the last train - originality
is not this film 's strong point.indeed strong point are sadly lacking .
the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never really fully explained
as seems little more than an under developed plot device.franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnel and scream every so often ,
indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film ,
out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.if creepy film
set on the london underground are your bag ,
or you just want to play 'spot the tube location ' them pick this up on dvd
when it hits a bargain bin .
if you are looking for classic horror ,
go and dig up a copy of death line
( aka raw meat )
.if you are looking for a quality well written
and acted film ,
you will need to change train ... ..
