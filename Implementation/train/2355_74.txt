*** warning !
spoiler contained herein !
*** this is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna
if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island .
there is absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role ,
and it shows .
she is just madonna playing madonna ,
and she can not even get that right .
i know
what you are saying ,
you are saying ,
`` how do you know this is what madonna is really like ,
you have never met her ! ''
correct 
i have not ,
but we all remember `` truth or dare '' ,
do not we ?
i know kevin costner does .
you would think ,
in the year 2002 ,
that madonna might have learned something 
one way or the other 
from the `` crossover '' lady
that have also made their way
across the silver screen .
for goodness ' sake 
has not madonna seen `` glitter '' ?
mariah carey showed the film world
how it is done ! ! !
mariah kicks madonna 's trashy butt to the curb in beauty 
talent ,
screen presence 
charisma 
characterization ,
you name it !
all we see from this glimpse into madonna 's world is she is the only one in it .
if there is one thing
to be said for madonna ,
it is that she is consistent .
when she was an mtv darling ,
she set the world of woman 's fashion back 20 year .
now 
in film 
she has set woman 's role in film and society back 20 year ,
by glamourizing all the most hated 
horrible 
reprehensible 
odious quality woman have been reputed to have locked away inside them ,
quality they have been so desperately trying to prove
they really do not possess .
***here is the spoiler ! ! !
do not read any further
if you do not want to know ... *** here is the one good thing
i
will say about this film ,
and i really was impressed by it .
they did not go for the `` hollywood ending ''
- madonna 's character life .
in the typical 
happy hollywood ending 
madonna 's character would have died on the island ,
and her long-suffering 
oppressed 
whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good 
decent woman 
a woman
who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife ,
and they both live happily ever after .
but in this extremely depressing conclusion 
she is rescued ,
and once more 
this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife ,
and his life will once again become a living hell .
