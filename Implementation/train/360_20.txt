bought this movie in the bargain bin at roger video store for $ 2 .
i enjoy a good b movie
now
and then
and figured this looked like a good one.the movie is quite cliche `` 1970 's ''
and is quite groovy for that .
unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie .
in fact 
i turned it off
after watching it for 45 minute
and figured a week later
that i should watch the whole thing no matter
how slow it was.the movie has good spot in it ,
but you have to wait and wait
and wait ... ... .for them.if you are into b movie ,
this might just be for you ,
just be warned
that the movie is slow
and not much really happens ,
and did i mention not much story line either ...
