this movie was amusing at time ,
hell sometime it was even downright funny.the underlying message i got from the film though ,
was that woman are responsible for all of the trouble of man .
every time a woman is depicted in the film ,
she is being lazy ,
being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason .
i do not think
the message involved is good for woman or gay men.but ,
it is a comedy ,
and a piece of art ,
so it is simply someones point of view .
even if i do not agree with it ,
they are still entitled to it.an amusing film ,
but some of the comment other have made are just plain stupid .
best film ever my foot .
