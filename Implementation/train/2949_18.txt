this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel
known to me .
the representation of the court of chancery as a 'character ' in the drama is magnificent .
the acting is marvellous 
from the sinister tulkinghorn 
to the dedlock 
smallweed 
crooke 
miss flyte 
and the two young lover .
but it is the spider 's web of chancery
that holds the whole thing together ,
and the cinematography is superb .
what mistake did the bbc make about copyright
that meant that this version could not be seen in the uk on either video or dvd for many year ?
i tried to find out from them ,
but faced a stone wall .
in the end i got a dvd copy from canada .
