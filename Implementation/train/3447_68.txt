this movie 's origin are a mystery to me ,
as i only know as much as imdb did
before i rented it .
i assume
that before `` starship trooper '' 
`` killshot '' was one of the countless unaired pilot
that never made it to network 
cable 
or otherwise .
the new title of `` kill shot '' is comically thrown into the opening sequence 
the first of many quick clue
that this was not ever intended for the cinema .
the quick cut 
cheesy `` melrose place '' music ,
and short 2-second close-up candid shot of the main actor let you know
what you are in for.and i do not mind at all .
i rented this movie
seeing the repackaging
that puts casper van dien and denise richard on the cover in front of a volleyball net
thinking
it would be funny to see them in a movie
besides the scifi travesty of starship trooper
( an excellent book 
in my opinion 
not so hot a movie -
but that is another review ) .
after looking it up on imdb 
my roommate and i surmised
that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of trooper and richard own career
( see bond-girl and wild thing reference here ) .
they threw in a sex scene
involving a minor character
to reach the coveted r-rated status -
coveted in suspense video rental section ,
that is .
in any event 
they should have left it unrated
if you are trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.all in all ,
it is entertaining .
i hate to spoil the fun of telling
you it is a tv pilot 
though .
that was the biggest pull
while watching it -
when you expect a cinematic movie
and get a tv show ,
the difference between them make themselves more clear than usual.would i rent it again ?
no .
would i watch this tv show ?
well 
why not - it is better than baywatch .
and their meager attempt at hitting all demographic would have done well back in the mid 90s .
token black guy
( who 's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating ) ,
token asian
( japanese ,
i assume from the name koji )
more adept at science and computer
than talking to woman 
beautiful 
intelligent latina pre-med student
who has everything going for her except her family 's bank account - this show probably would have done ok.but
as a movie
it just cracks me.i
gave it a 7/10 ,
considering what it was and what it was forced to become .
it made for a very enjoyable evening ,
and that is all i ask of rental .
