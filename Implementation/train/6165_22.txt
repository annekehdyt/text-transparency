hilarious 
laugh out loud moment ...
and yet not a comedy .
i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the `` filthy bum ''
who then shouts after them in anger
`` you filthy bum '' ,
i mean wow ,
someone 's online degree in literature is paying off !
the worst script imaginable 
with plot introduction in an instant 
ridiculous movement in the story 
zero character development
( even between the character
who meet ..
it is as if they all have known and trusted each other for year )
dodgy voice over with added echo effect ,
and plot hole.. oh god are there plot hole ! !
to be honest i write this
not even having watched the entire thing ,
but i certainly expect the last 30 min or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we have got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget
that the film is a load of ... well ...
use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence !
