this seems like two film :
one a dreary 
pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor
who is taken over by the part he plays ;
the other a illiant social comment about a middle aged divorce
who is picked up by a waitress .
shelley winter is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side .
she drops heavy hint about the need for connection 
her certificate in massage and her desire
to get into the modelling game .
i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain ,
and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing ,
puff-sleeved crochet top.do actor get oscar for shakespeare ?
we know
they oscar for impersonating disabled person ,
wearing a lot of prosthetic 
or pretending
to be mad .
the shakespearean scene
( which go on and on )
are embarrassing and dated .
and so are the 'going mad ' scene
where tony look distracted
while listening to his own voice-over.by the way ,
anthony john is not aristocratic .
he makes it quite clear in an early scene
that he used to be a chorus boy .
when he quotes his father 's advice ,
he slips into a cockney accent .
