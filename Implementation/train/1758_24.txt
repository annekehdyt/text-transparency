i enjoy quality crapness ,
and this ranks up there with some of the finest .
the cg is out of this world 
or at least pre-dates our world 
and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing
after person is laughably bad .
i quite enjoyed some of this ,
but the acting is so goddamn awful ,
and even the obligatory nude scene does not really have any bap out in it .
just a complete waste of time
if ever i saw one .
i do not know
who wasted more time 
me watching this 
or the poor sap
who got dragged into making it in the faint hope
that this will launch their acting career .
i can assure you 
it wont .
however 
on a ighter note 
i have managed to successfully do the 6 degree of kevin bacon from this movie ,
so i think
it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minute of it .
