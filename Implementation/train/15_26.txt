`` radiofreccia '' is still a good surprise in italian cinema .
the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue ,
who also directs the movie
and writes the music score -of course.the film is a portrait of north italian province life 
in the emilia romagna region .
we are in 1975 ,
the time of the first free radio -one of the boy of the movie creates `` radioraptus '' .
youth wish 
friendship 
love 
sex 
individual dramas and unemployment are among the theme ,
but the film speak also about drug -freccia ,
the main character 
is a victim of heroin slavery.without
being boring and moralist 
the story flows very well ;
the spontaneity of actor is strong and the way
of directing as well .
obviously luciano `` liga '' ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional ,
first of all he is a musician .
but he succeeds in making a good product .
unfortunately he will not repeat the success with his second movie `` da zero a dieci '' -not good at all.in `` radiofreccia '' actor are generally not very famous ,
the only star is stefano accorsi -one of the most popular young italian actor .
see in a small role another italian songwriter -francesco guccini ,
he is the nice communist barman and football trainer !
