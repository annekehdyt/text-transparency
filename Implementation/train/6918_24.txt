i have to say
despite
it is reviews angel in the outfield
was a pretty good movie .
i like the fact how it teaches kid to always have faith
and never give up
because yes miracle can happen .
unlike the other baseball movie this one particular movie
stood out
because of hit amazing special effect and well orchestrated soundtrack
which was very interesting .
though i liked this movie it did have some flaw such as some irrelevancy
( i.e .
towards the end
when ray mitchell hit a homer
he
does not step on the plate
and therefore
that would not be a score .
but that is just nitpicking . )
i have to say
i was really impressed with this movie 's presence and moral :
just have faith ,
do not give up .
