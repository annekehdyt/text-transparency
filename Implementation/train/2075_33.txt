to be honest ,
i am surprised by the positive vote
that this film has received .
the movie just drags along its 81 minute life span ,
and the audience has to suffer the whole way through .
actually there are some positive moment in this film ;
charlie spradling gives a decent performance .
she is given some pretty pathetic dialogue
and she handles it pretty well .
scott valentine
( merrideth 's boyfriend in family ty ) ,
on the other hand 
is a pretty rough watch .
i guess
the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy
laying on the beach
wearing tiger-patterned chummy ...
.give me a eak .
also 
valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire
who misses the day
( to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire
see denice duff in `` bloodstorm :
subspecy 4 '' ) .
the movie move so slow
and is only positively punctuated by ,
and to be honest 
charlie spradling 's dance scene .
this movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fan of charlie spradling
( which i am ,
and i still had a rough time
watching it !
) .
