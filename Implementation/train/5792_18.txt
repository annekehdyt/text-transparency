i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law
and order for a long time .
kathryn erbe 
det .
alexandra eame 
the female detective is rather hard
and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series .
see her other side in this movie.this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actress
and
if you are a criminal intent
fan this movie is a revelry in her acting
and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardship in the south.i did not like albert finney role in this movie
because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow
that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change .
he reminds me of so many man from my youth and the portrayal is divine ,
but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie.katryn erbe is easy to like in this movie
and why i recommand it as a 10 star for criminal intent 
law and order fan .
