actually 
the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie
that educates us on our delicate self .
c.g .
and special camera
-- assisted by imax --
incredibly display the inner
( and outer )
working of an average human ,
be it adult man and woman 
boy and girl 
or baby .
nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed :
digestion 
reproduction
( featuring a marvin gaye hit ) ,
the heart 
etc .
some especially revealing momants include
how an infant can be immersed underwater
and also how the ain 's impulse look .
it is amazing how we function.the subject matter skip around an awful lot .
but at all time we still learn a hell of a lot about our body
that we should be *required* to know .
