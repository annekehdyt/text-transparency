have you ever ,
or do you have ,
a pet who 's been with you through thick and thin ,
who you would be lost without ,
and who you love no matter what ?
betcha never thought
they feel the same way
about you ! wonderful 
wonderful family film .
if you have a soft spot for animal ,
this is guaranteed
to make you cry no matter your age .
i used
to watch this movie all the time
when i was a little kid ,
and i find
that now 
at age sixteen 
i love it as much
as i did then .
i could never decide on a favorite character then ,
and i still do not think
i can !
i love all three of the animal .
the dialogue seems very real and comfortable 
like a loving 
but feuding family .
i do love chance ,
and how at the end he says
that he has a family at last .
cheesy 
yes 
but one must remember
that this is meant to be a family film ,
and it fulfills that role perfectly .
sassy has just the perfect dose of `` sassiness ''
and shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young 
adventurous chance.the animal way outshine the human ,
but of course most of the teary moment are to be had during an interaction with them
( ie .
rescuing molly 
and the end ) .
not to mention the incredible soundtrack
that gives each moment even more emotion ,
and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling .
i give this 9/10 .
to be compared to ( and even rated better than ) cat and dog and babe .
