the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning
when the writer and director left out a good story line ,
only to substitute with horrible special affect .
this movie seemed to be focused on amusing child ,
but could not even accomplish that .
many small low budget film have the potential
to become great movie ,
but this movie is no where near that .
fortunately this will be another film easily made 
and easily forgotten .
this movie was probably a chance for the actor to make a little money on the side
until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie .
anyone
who has a shred of respect for film ,
should avoid seeing this movie at all cost .
