during a kurt weill celeation in brooklyn ,
where do we go from here ?
was finally unearthed for a screening .
it is amazing that a motion picture 
from any era ,
that has weill-gershwin collaboration can possibly be missing from the screen .
the score stands tall ,
and a cd of the material 
with gershwin and weill 
only underscores its merit ,
which are considerable .
yes 
the film has its problem ,
but the score is not one of them .
ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy ,
and fred macmurray can not quite grasp the material .
then 
too 
the 'modern ' segment is weakly written .
but the fantasy element carry the film to a high mark ,
as does the work of the two delightful leading lady - joan leslie and june haver .
both have the charm
that this kind of work desperately needs to work .
as a world war ii salute to our country 's history - albeit in a 'never was ' framework ,
the film has its place in hollywood musical history
and should be available for all
to see
and to find its considerable merit .
