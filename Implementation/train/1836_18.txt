it is all very simple .
jake goes to prison ,
and spends five year with the con and the chess master .
they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure 
and utterly misery
that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small trick and control of the rule of small crook .
they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom :
from his innermost fear 
from what he believes to be himself .
for that 
they take him on a trip
where he got to let go all the fear ,
all the pride 
all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will.it is a clever movie about the journey of illumination 
about the infinite gamble and game
that we do with and within ourselves .
10/10 
no doubt .
