the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film
-- and even that was disappointing compared to some other film .
my gawd ! to me 
this is the worst kind of film
-- one
that assumes
it is a work of art
because it has all the trapping of film-as-art .
yes 
it is beautifully photographed ,
but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around
which the film supposedly surrounds itself .
tango is a tease ,
it is hot ,
it has drama ,
it is audacious
-- precisely what this film is not .
