hm .
while an enjoyable movie to poke plot hole ,
point out atrocious acting 
primitive
( at best )
special effect
( all of which have caused me to view this movie three time over the past six year ) ,
severed rank among the worst i have ever seen .
i am never sure
who the protagonist are ,
all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine ,
as seen in the dance floor murder scene .
all in all 
i do not really like the movie ,
because only the first 30 minute are enjoyable ,
the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery
that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion
( which i can not remember anyway ) .
