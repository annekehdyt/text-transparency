i have seen better teenage werewolf movie in my time 
this one however 
takes the cake .
more comedy than horror 
`` full moon high '' puts the `` c '' in cheese-fest .
the star quality in this movie is not bad .
just the way
it was made just send in rolling downhill .
adam arkin plays tony 
an all-american high school football player of the 50 's
who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania .
the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player .
he drove everyone batty !
ed mcmahon plays his ultra-conservative father
who met his end of his own bullet .
adam 's father alan plays a shrink
who seems to be not top of his game .
after all these year tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack ,
and then he will get the chance
to catch in his state .
more laugh than blood shed ,
this movie is just a start in the 80 's 
`` teen wolf '' was an improvement from this !
1 out of 5 star .
