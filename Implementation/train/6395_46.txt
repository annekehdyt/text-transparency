this movie is horrible- in a 'so bad
it is good ' kind of way.the storyline is rehashed from so many other film of this kind ,
that i am not going to even bother describing it .
it is a sword/sorcery picture ,
has a kid hoping
to realize
how important he is in this world ,
has a `` nomadic '' adventurer 
an evil aide/sorcerer 
a princess 
a hairy creature ...
.you get the point.the first time i
caught this movie
was during a very harsh winter .
i do not know
why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minute
before turning the channel ,
but when i caught site of gulfax 
i decided to stay
and watch it
until the end.gulfax is a white 
furry creature akin to chewbacca 
but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch .
he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together
and forced the actor to wear it .
there are scene
where it looks like the actor can not move within ,
or that he is almost falling over .
although he is not in the movie
that much 
the few scene are worth
it !
watch
as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson ,
taking the solo-chewbacca comparison 's to an even higher level !
i actually bought this movie
just because of that character ,
and still have it somewhere !
gulfax may look like sh ! t ,
but he made this movie ! ! !
the only reason i have never seen the sequel ,
or even sought it out ,
was because of his absence !
perhaps should there be a final film ,
completing the trilogy ,
gulfax will make a much-anticipated return !
