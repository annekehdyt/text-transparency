i totally disagree with the other reviews.all basically negative.i took a chance on this movie
and was glad
that i did.glad indeed.i could not find anything wrong with it.nothing period.the script is original.the actor are all likable and convincing.dee smart reminded me of marcium brady from the brady bunch.but this gal truly can act.the
setting in the australian outback is perfect.incredible scenery.great soundtrack i.e paul kelly.god bless paul kelly.the cranberry are also here.i have seen this movie
twice in less than 24 hrs.i will probably watch it again.it is that interesting.it makes one think.it is
( was )
probably better than nine-tenth of the so-called hollywood blockbuster
that were also out during this time.back of beyond is a likable.well photographed film.i
could not find anything wrong with it.check
it out ! my first review !
