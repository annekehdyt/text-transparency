whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmuller 's film
is incomprehensible.this new film is a mess .
there was one other person in the audience
when i saw it ,
and she left about an hour into it .
( i hope
she demanded a refund . )
the only reason
i stayed through to the end
was because i have never walked out of a movie.but i
sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted
that madonna and ritchie could actually think
they made a good film .
the dialogue is laughable ,
the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery .
ritchie took lina 's movie
and turned it into another `` blue lagoon .
`` this is a film
that you would not even waste time
watching late night on cinemax .
time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this .
