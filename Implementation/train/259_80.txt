i thought
rachel york was fantastic as `` lucy . ''
i have seen her in `` kiss me 
kate '' and `` victor/victoria 
'' as well ,
and in each of these performance
she has developed very different ,
and very real 
characterization .
she is a chameleon
who can play
( and sing )
anything ! i am very surprised at how many negative review appear here
regarding rachel 's performance in `` lucy . ''
even some bonafide tv and entertainment critic seem to have missed the point of her portrayal .
so many person have focused on the fact
that rachel does not really look like lucy .
my response to that is 
`` so what ? ''
i was not looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy .
i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown .
and rachel certainly gave us that 
in great depth .
i also did not want to see someone simply `` doing '' classic lucy routine .
therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producer and director
to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skit - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory .
( it seems that some of the reviewer did not realize
that these two scene were meant to be rehearsal sequence and not the actual skit ) .
this approach 
i thought 
gave an innovative twist to sketch
that so many of us know by heart .
i also thought
rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scene .
and she absolutely nailed the routine
that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping 
in particular .
there was one moment in the grape scene
where the corner of rachel 's mouth had the exact little upturn
that i remember lucy having .
i could not believe
she was able to capture
that - and so naturally.i wonder
if many of the folk
who criticized the performance
were expecting to see the lucille ball of `` i love lucy ''
throughout the entire movie .
after all 
those of us
who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea
what lucy was really like in her early movie year .
i think
rachel showed a natural progression in the character
that was illiant .
she planted all the right seed for us
to see the clown just waiting to emerge ,
given the right set of circumstance .
lucy did not fit the mold of the old studio system .
in her frustrated attempt to become the stereotypical movie star of that era ,
she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.i believe
that rachel deftly captured the comedy 
drama 
wit 
sadness 
anger 
passion 
love 
ambition 
loyalty 
sexiness 
self absorption 
childishness ,
and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon .
and she did it with an authenticity and freshness
that was totally endearing .
`` lucy '' was a star turn for rachel york .
i hope
it ings a flood of great role her way in the future .
i also hope
it ings her an emmy .
