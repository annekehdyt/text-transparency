thunderbird are go !
and so began thunderbird 
a childhood favorite of mine .
when i heard
that they were going to make a thunderbird movie ,
i was ecstatic .
i could not wait to see thunderbird 2 roar in to save person ,
while thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the you get the idea .
i just could not wait .
then came august 2004 ,
when the movie was finally released .
critic panned it ,
but i still wanted to go .
after all ,
as long as the heart was in the same place ,
that was all that mattered to me .
so i sat down in the theater ,
the only teenager in a crowd of 50 everyone else was over thirty and under ten .
quite possibly the most awkward theater experience
that i have ever had the movie
( which is intended to be a prequel )
focuses on alan tracy
( brady corbet ) ,
the youngest of the tracy family .
he spends his day wishing
that he could be rescuing person like the rest of his family ,
but he is too young .
one day 
he finally gets his chance when the hood
( ben kingsley )
traps the rest of his family up on thunderbird 5
( the space station ) .
this involves him having to outsmart the hood 's henchman and rescue his family in time
before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of england.trust me ,
the plot sound like a regular episode of thunderbird
when you read it on paper .
once it gets put on to film what a mess we have on our hand .
first off 
the film was intended for child ,
much like the original show was .
however 
gerry anderson treated us like adult ,
and gave us plot
that were fairly advanced for child 's programming .
this on the other hand 
dumbs down the plot
as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kid franchise .
the final product is a movie
that tries to appeal to fan of the thunderbird series and child ,
while missing both entirely .
lame joke 
cartoonish sound 
and stupid antic
that no one really finds amusing
are all over this movie ,
and i am sure
that jonathan frake is wishing
he had never directed this.over all ,
everyone gave a solid performance ,
considering the script
that they were all given .
ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood ,
playing the part extremely well .
my only complaint about the character is about the hood 's henchman ,
who are reduced to leftover from old looney tune cartoon ,
bumbling about as 
amazingly enough ,
the kid take them on with ease.what is odd about this movie
is that
while i was watching the movie ,
i had fun .
but once the light went up ,
i realized
that the movie was fairly bad ,
i was $ 8 lighter ,
and two hour of my time were now gone .
a guilty pleasure ?
perhaps .
nonetheless 
thunderbird is a forgettable mess .
instead of a big `` go '' ,
i am going to have to recommend
that you stay away from this movie .
if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minute of it ,
it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbird name .
however 
we get a movie
that only die-hard thunderbird fan
( if you would like to watch your childhood
torn to piece )
or the extremely bored should bother with.my rating for thunderbird is 1 \u00bd star .
