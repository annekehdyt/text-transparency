actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray little richard than leon .
he captures little richard to a most believable essence .
the outfit where wonderful and any person
watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie .
although the movie is a little long ,
it keeps your attention with the personality and outfit of little richard in mind .
the ending should have taken a direction
of moving little richard more into the present
where you could see him
as he has aged into this new millennium .
he will always be the king of rock-n-roll as far as i am concerned
regardless of what the other medium says .
