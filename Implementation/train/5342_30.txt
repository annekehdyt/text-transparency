i found the one
and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative
and altogether too harsh ,
so i have decided to write my own .
i first saw this movie
when it came out
and have caught it a few time more since then .
first of all let me say
that 
overall 
the thing
that this movie gets right
are what make it worthwhile .
it does not matter
that it has some low budget quirk and other fault .
it is worth watching .
the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman 's visit a restrictive 
narrow-minded anglo-canadian community in southern ontario and inging person to life is a illiant mis-en-scene .
the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in person .
and in that sense it is exactly accurate .
the acting - especially by rip torn
( whitman )
and colm feore as the doctor - is very good .
the scripting and dialogue are strong
and pay proper attention to the more and inflection of the time .
overall 
what is not to like ?
besides 
name another film
in which whitman is ought so vividly to life ?
