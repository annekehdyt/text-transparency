some spoiler
if you are a big horror movie fan ,
then you will know
that halloween paved the way for many slasher film .
often imitated 
never duplicated 
this movie is a true horror classic
and is definitely one of the scariest movie ever made ,
if not the scariest.i actually saw this movie
after seeing the rest of the series
( do not ask me why ) .
i honestly saw the other 7 movie
before seeing this one ,
that is just how it worked out .
but i would have to say this one blows all the other away .
it is genuinely frightening ,
and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine .
my favorite part of the movie was
when michael stabs a guy ,
and leans his head to one side .
it is one of the eeriest image in movie history.later slasher 
such as the friday the 13th film 
were more fun and less intense than this movie .
i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series ,
but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movie .
michael myer is such a scary villain
because he is realistic ,
you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing person .
i admit this movie gave me nightmare
after watching it for a few nights.what is great about this movie
is that it does not rely on gore or humor
to entertain the audience .
it is just pure terror .
it is too bad the later film of the series swayed from this one ,
because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie
as they come .
