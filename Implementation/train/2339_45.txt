believe
it or do not ,
i have my very own dvd copy of this `` movie ''
which i bought at walgreen for a great big whole dollar .
i am still not sure
if it was a dollar well
spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.pretty amazing set design and costume .
apparently much thought
and effort went into their making .
the set design are very mexican in stylization .
i liked them a lot .
and santa is impressive .
one of the more impressive santa in moviedom.i am guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kid audience .
but 
somehow 
it comes across quite deranged .
in fact 
i am left stunned at how deranged it is.maybe it is the english dubbing
that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre .
one of the reason i prefer to experience movie in the original language
they were made and the use of english subtitle
as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness .
the kid voice were at least dubbed with actual kid voice
as opposed to woman pretending to be kid
which tends to sound very ,
very weird.did you know
that demon in hell spend their free time dancing around
doing ballet in their longjohns ?
you did not ?
neither did i until i watched this movie .
one learns something
new everyday.is this movie actually worth watching ?
now 
that is a tossup .
i can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone
as it is quite disturbing in its own bizarre way .
yet 
its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching .
you decide
what you are going to do .
i dunno ... for myself 
it made me feel uncomfortable
seeing demon constantly doing cutesy ballet move .
now 
that is just wrong ...
