when i first read hamlet ,
i could not help but think of the ending of outrageous fortune ,
where bette midler puts down the play
because of how indecisive he is ,
and says ,
`` give me romeo any day . ''
five act of a man
trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not ?
seemed like overkill to me .
but upon further reading ,
i grew to really appreciate the play .
i have seen the olivier and gibson movie version ( and part of the nicol williamson version ) ,
and all of them take their model from olivier ; the melancholy dane .
olivier at least did it without being self-indulgent about it ,
but gibson and 
from what i saw 
williamson 
looked like they went to the `` look 
ma ,
i am acting !
i am acting ! ''
school.now here comes kenneth branagh 's version ,
which is eathtaking from start to finish .
it finished # 2 on my top ten of 1996
( behind the english patient 
and ahead of lone star 
jerry maguire 
fargo 
secret and ly 
everyone says
i love you 
flirting with disaster 
big night ,
and looking for richard ) ,
and it is the best hamlet ,
and maybe the best shakespeare 
put to film .
obviously 
branagh 's talent as a filmmaker ,
for making the full-length version 
in 70mm print ,
and not losing our interest for four hour ,
is great ,
but what seems to get overlooked in discussion about this film is his performance in the title role .
this was my favorite performance of the year by far .
branagh avoids the melodrama
which actor seem to get trapped in by playing hamlet as a normal 
regular human being ,
and makes us understand his action and feeling each step of the way .
and unlike olivier ,
who depended mostly on his voice ,
branagh uses his entire body
to demonstrate the range of emotion
that hamlet goes through ,
but since he plays him as normal ,
none of it seems like scenery-chewing.the rest of the cast is top-notch as well .
i did not even mind jack lemmon ,
though i agree
he was the weakest member of the cast .
the most surprising turn came from charlton heston ;
i have always found him stiff as a board ,
but he is quite commanding as the player king .
the other big surprise was billy crystal ;
i thought
i would find him all wrong as the 1st gravedigger ,
but he was his usual funny self
while being in character .
all in all 
a glorious film !
