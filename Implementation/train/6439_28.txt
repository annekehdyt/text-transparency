yet another `` son who will not grow up '' flick ,
and just the other recent like entry .
heder in another bad wig 
channeling napoleon for 
what 
the third time ?
anna faris is forgettable 
as always ;
jeff daniel phoned this one in from another state 
at least ;
and diane keaton ... how does one become typecast this late in a career ?
do not bother .
nothing is said here
that has not been covered many time over .
i will say this ;
it is about a hundred time better than `` failure to launch '' .
there are very few amusing bit in the movie ,
unless
you think
eli wallach cursing is funny .
ha 
ha !
he is old
and he dropped the f-bomb !
tee 
hee 
hee .
pitiful !
