a propaganda film for the palestinian `` cause '' .
if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli-palestinian conflict ,
you will need to look elsewhere .
if you are an anti-semite
( or merely an anti-zionist --
-nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country 
right ? )
or uncritically in support of palestinian goal
( e.g. 
mass murder 
the destruction of israel ) ,
this is the documentary for you .
should make for an entertaining evening on college campuse around the uk and us .
however 
any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of ly
presented in this video .
i just hope those
who truly are unaware of the situation
are not corrupted by this anti-semitic filth .
