i think
this is almost all i need to say .
i feel obliged to explain my action though .
i have basically never seen such an armature production ,
and i mean that in all sense of the word .
although he physical camera work ,
boom mic operation and other technical aspect of this film are laughable ,
unfortunately its not the only area .
unlike some classic independent film
that have been saved by their script great characterization and plot ,
this unfortunately has an awful script 
awful acting and worst of all 
awful annoying character .
it is a crime
that for the every independent film
that gets 
distribution like haiku tunnel ,
there is a 101 other indie film
that died silent death .
i do not know
who the kornbluth other know at sony ,
but that can be my only explanation
as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution .
i am quite bemused
as to why they picked this up.the only part of this film
that holds out any intrigue is its title .
however 
the reason for that is even a let down .
i hope
this review will save a few person
that may be intrigued by this film title from going to watch it .
i have seen a lot of film in my time ,
and i am very forgiving
when in the cinema 
but this was too much .
i will never forget 'tunnel ' 
for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema .
shame
it is such a low point .
