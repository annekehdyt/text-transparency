in mexico city 
the former cia assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man john creasy
( denzel washington )
is hired by the industrialist samuel ramos
( marc anthony ) ,
with the recommendation of his old friend rayburn
( christopher walken ) ,
to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita
( dakota fanning )
and his wife lisa
( radha mitchell ) .
pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy ,
making him live and smile again ,
and he feels a great affection for her .
when the girl is kidnapped
and creasy is informed
that she was murdered by the criminal ,
he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction .
`` man on fire '' is almost a masterpiece ,
and will become certainly a classic in the future .
the story is excellent ,
never corny
and although having 146 minute running time ,
the viewer does not feel time passing .
the cast is composed by excellent actor and actress ,
their performance are outstanding ,
highlighting denzel washington 
dakota fanning and radha mitchell .
the cinematography has wonderful moment ,
and the screenplay has stunning line .
i personally loved
when the character of christopher walken explains to manzano
( giancarlo giannini )
that creasey 's specialty is death ,
and he is preparing his masterpiece .
i agree with the user
that commented
that `` man on fire ''
is one of the best 
if not the best 
film of the year in this genre .
my vote is ten.title
( brazil ) :
`` chamas da vingan\u00e7a ''
( `` flame of the revenge '' )
