this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective .
while the story is simple
it is pure and straightforward .
in truth 
it is the standard story of a simple 
honorable man
whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier man of the period.poor vs. rich 
honorable vs. dishonorable 
a classic but well-told tale
without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.extra point
just because you can almost smell the person on the screen .
