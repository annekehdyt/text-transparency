i was going to say
this was the worst gay-themed film i
have ever seen ,
but i can honestly say
this is the worst film
if any genre i have ever seen.you know you are in trouble
when a movie starts with a `` personal note '' from the director ,
asking for the audience 's `` understanding '' for the `` many challenge ''
facing a first-time director .
the audio track is so bad in many scene
it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue 
and this from a dvd version .
bad lighting 
bad set 
bad photography 
poor script 
generally bad acting all add up
to make this `` film '' unwatchable .
i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempt ,
and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased .
i am
sure there are many challenge
facing a first-time director .
but 
do not try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product .
i see from imdb detail
that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale ,
but also the only .
that is the one positive thing i can say about this alleged `` movie '' .
