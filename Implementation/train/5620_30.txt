i am a huge adam sandler fan ,
and one day i was looking at the castandcrew selection on one of his dvd 's
and saw 'going overboard '
and decided to go out and rent it .
so i went out with a few buddy of mine
and rented it .
we put it on
and we were shocked to see an adam sandler
that did not hit puberty yet ,
he looks
as if he was 12
when this movie came out .
i could not even watch 30 minute of this crap ,
i did not laugh 
chuckle 
or even smirk at this movie ,
actually the only time i smirked was
when i saw
how horrid this movie was .
i could not believe
how hard he tried to make the viewer laugh in this movie ...
and it did not work once .
although from seeing the horribly awful camera angle and hearing the disgusting script i realized
why i had never heard of this movie 
...
because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before .
this movie 
in my opinion 
was the worst movie ever made 
... .ever !
