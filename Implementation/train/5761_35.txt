was this movie stupid ?
yup .
did this movie depth ?
nope .
character development ?
nope .
plot twist ?
nope .
this was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized springer show .
it shows the length
that some person will go to get their mug on tv .
molly hagan did a great job as jaime pressly 's mom .
jaime is ... .well ... gorgeous !
this flick was not so much made to be a `` eakthrough '' movie 
rather ,
it was intended to life in a trailer park
( i live in a trailer park
and ours is nothing like the one in this movie )
where everyone sleeps with everyone else ,
all the girl get pregnant by different guy ,
and all the guy drive rusted-out '66 ford pickup
( exaggeration 
of course ,
but that is the picture everyone sees
when you mention `` trailer park '' ) .
some person over-analyze movie
( case-in-point :
star trek freak ) .
i watch movie purely for the entertainment value ;
not to point out
that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene
( read the `` goofs '' bit about connie 's shirt .
could it have been better ?
sure .
but it was funny as hell .
