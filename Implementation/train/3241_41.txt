well .
astronaut steve west sit in a plastic space capsule ,
commenting
that `` you have not lived
until you have seen the sun through the ring of saturn '' ,
all the while the obvious mid-day sunlight is streaming through the window ,
when suddenly he has a nose bleed .
next 
west is back home in some secret hospital 
a melting gelatinous mass
who goes berserk
and causes a chunky nurse
to run through a fake glass door .
apparently 
west `` gets stronger as he melts '' ,
which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly purile 
adle-ained moovie .
then this dopey `` army brass '' ,
who look kind of like coleman francis
( director of many bad moovy )
try to cover the info up ,
but goo man runs around killing everyone
he sees
because he is melting .
he attacks a bickering old couple
because he is melting .
he makes one terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minute
because he is melting .
he is melting
because he is melting .
the fx by the slumming rick baker are supposed to be the star here ,
but they just look hokey .
the film is poorly shot
and everything look so dark and muddled
that it is very difficult
making out what is what -
not that it would help any .
moocow says
who cut the cheese with this one ? ?

=8p ps - `` did not you get any cracker ? ''
