hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away ,
however what is often overlooked are director 's first film effort .
who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138 ?
i remember
seeing fragment of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minute in late 80s
and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation .
so
when i found a copy in a well known store for \u00a39 i could not resist
but buy it .
the odd thing is that the last 45 minute of the movie do not tally with my memory of it
( memory is funny that way )
.viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artist portfolio is how very like jean 'moebius ' giraud some of the artwork is .
i can only assume some influence here.when pazu catches a falling girl
( sheeta )
his adventure really begins - the quest for laputa - a reference to jonathan swift 's overlooked portion of gulliver 's travel .
with healthy reference to jule verne
it is a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion
having the hero end up on laputa.this
is the portion
that is strongest in my memory -
the 'pastoral ' ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robot
covered in moss beneath the giant tree .
this is 
in my opinion 
the highlight of the movie - the view of the surface of laputa ,
as opposed to the mechanised underground.although this is the dichotomy of this movie -
to show
that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animal .
the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly
the same.it is incredibly stylish ,
i would not say
'slick ' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the building 
airship and the design and look of just about everything.myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime .
buy this movie and treasure it .
