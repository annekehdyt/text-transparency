ok. i think
the tv show is kind of cute
and it always has some kind of lesson
involved .
so ,
when my kid decided
they wanted to see this movie ,
i decided to tag along .
i wish
i would stayed home
and watched the tv show instead.the fact
that the humor is silly
and unoriginal is the least of the problem with this movie .
the plot is next to non-existant ,
the character seem to exist in a vacuum ,
and 
worst of all 
gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever .
it appears that disney took all of the thing
that make inspector gadget work on tv
and tossed them all .
to be fair 
my younger child
( 8 year old )
liked the movie but the older one
( 10 year old )
came away thinking it silly
( he was too old for the youth humor
but too young for any of the adult humor )
.generally 
i like disney film but this one misses by a mile .
it is ok for a very narrow age band
( say 7 to 9 )
but a must miss for everybody else .
