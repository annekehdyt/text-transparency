richard attenborough
who already given us magnific film as `` a chorus line '' and `` gandhi '' ,
once more surprise us
making a beautiful hymn to the nature .
indeed 
the vast and ( in that time )
unexplored territory of canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscape
picked up by the motion picture camera .
if the movie is really based on a true story ,
once more become evidente that `` man of vision ''
are 
in truth 
man
that lives beyond their time 
with a historical perspective
that only the time will give them reason .
the cinematography is magnificient 
such as the cast lead by pierce brosnan ,
whose performance is due to attenborough 's master hand .
a pleasing surprise is the appearance of annie galipeau in the role of archie 's beloved .
movie that must appears in a list of those
who really loves the nature ...
