i am a back batman movie and tv fan .
i loved the show
( new and old )
and i loved all the movie .
but this movie is not as great
as some person were hopeing it to be .
in my opinon 
it is a big let down .
i think
the problem was it had no drama .
batman :
mask of the phantasm and batman beyond :
return of the joker had a lot of drama .
and batman and mr. freeze :
sub zero had some drama too .
also 
i think
this movie is to light for batman .
the only scene
that seems a little dark
is the big fight with bane at the end .
anyway 
it is an ok batman movie .
but i would just rent it .
