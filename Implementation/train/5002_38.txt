bollywood fan pretty much hold amitabh bachan 's mard in high regard
but i think
it is very overrated .
manmohan desai collaborated before on movie like suhaag 
parvarish 
amar akbar anthony 
naseeb 
desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked
so i had very high expectation
before i watched mard
and was bitterly disappointed .
my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2 ,
maybe mr desai ran out of idea ,
after all he had been using that formula for year and year .
1. first of all some member of the cast is repeated from aaa 
for instance the police inspector
who ings up amar 
the muslim
who ings up akbar 
nirupa roy and a few more .
2. in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight ,
in mard
she loses her voice 3. in aaa
there is the famous song
( shirdi wale sai baba )
well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali .
having seen aaa for over 1000 time i noticed
that straight away.my other gripe are that some of the situation just seem ridiculous ,
true manmohan desai made leave your ain at the door kind of movie but with mard i thought
he went too far .
my last gripe is that
compared to song in previous manmohan desai movie i found the song rather disappointing .
i know
it has many fan
that swear by it but i did not like it one bit .
it actually pains me to write this review
because i am such a huge fan
and have loved his movie since i was a child .
