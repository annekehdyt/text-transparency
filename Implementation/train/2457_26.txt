by far the worst movie of all time .
even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey .
i have heard
that the movie was originally supposed to be titled `` the treasure ''
but was changed to `` shark ' treasure ''
in order to take advantage of the excitement
created by `` jaws '' .
i think
shark were in one scene of this movie ;
the fact
that they happened to be included in this `` thriller ''
was supposed to sell ticket .
did not work .
anytime something `` good '' happens in the movie ,
the ship 's crew toast each other with a certain and of beer
that had just been introduced at the time
the movie was made .
gee 
do ya think
that beer might have been a sponsor ?
could they have made it any more obvious ?
the only time
anyone should eak out the beer
is
if they make it through this thing .
that is cause enough for celeation .
