i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister .
instead 
i had to really control myself in order to convince her
that i was not scared .
in many way still a children\u00b4s story ,
but with a screenplay
that has a lot of potential .
could have been one of the scariest movie
if planned for another audience .
