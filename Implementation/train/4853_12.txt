jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short
showing some of the best man of jazz
just doing their thing .
it is like watching a no frill music video today.the jazz man give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant
who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street .
i had never heard her sing before 
bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday .
that is a complimant folks.their instrumantal work is tops as well .
with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotype ,
this film is to be watched and treasured .
no great production value 
just a lot of good music .
