this movie is one of my favourite .
it is a genre-mixture with ingredient of the action-/horror-/romantic-/comedygenre .
some of the special effect may seem outdated
compared to modern standard .
this minor flaw is easily ignored .
there is so much to discover in this story .
the romantic relation between the two main character is so beautiful
that it hurts .
the visual are beautiful too .
the action is great
which is no surprise ,
it is originating from honkong 
birthplace of the world 's best action movie .
the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way .
somehow this movie is being able to balance the different mood
and keep being good .
absolutely recommended .
