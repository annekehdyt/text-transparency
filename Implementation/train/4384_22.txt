hahahaha ! ! ! ! !
! funny-that sum this movie up in one word.what the crap was this `` thing '' ,
since it might kill me to use the word movie ! ? ! ?
! i hope the director 
writer 
and producer did not mean for this to turn out good ,
because it sure did not ! !
! a scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark ,
and the shark killing a bunch of person
the scientist invited to the island ! !
! oh my gooooooodddd ! ! !
! i hate this film so much
that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious part ,
because they were so corny and unprofessional ... .and
they could not have made the shark look more unrealistic ,
even though this `` thing '' had a bit larger budget than most low-budget movies.all i
have to say
is watch this movie
expecting to laugh at all the bad acting ,
and stupid corny dialogue ,
because if you are expecting a good movie
you will be highly disappointed .
