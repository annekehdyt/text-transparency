i do not know
how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb .
this film ,
accompanied by `` i am curious :
blue '' is a masterwork.the only thing
that will let you down in this film
is
if you do not like the process of film ,
do not like psychology
or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming.this is not a film
that you will want to watch to unwind ;
it is a film
that you want to see like any other masterpiece 
with time 
attention and care .
******summary 
may contain a spoiler or two*******the main thing
about this film is that it blends the whole film 
within a film thing ,
but it does it in such a way
that sometimes you forget
that the fiction are not real.the film is like many film in one:1. a political documentary 
about the social system in sweden at the time .
which in a lot of way are still relevant to today .
interview done by a young woman
named lena.2 .
a narrative about a filmmaker 
vilgot sjoman ,
making a film ...
he deals with a relationship with his star in the film
and how he should have never got involved with person
he is supposed to work with.3 .
the film
that vilgot is making .
it is about a young woman
named lena
( ie .
# 2 ) ,
who is young and very politically active ,
she is making a documentary
( ie .
# 1 . ) .
she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality 
and the freedom of that.the magnificence and sheer illiance of `` i am curious :
yellow/blue '' is how these three element are cut together .
in one moment you are watching an interview about politic ,
and the next your watching
what the interviewer is doing behind the scene
but does that so well
that you sometimes forget
that it is the narrative.another thing
is the dynamic between `` yellow '' and `` blue '' ,
which
if you see one ,
you must see the other .
`` blue '' is not a sequel at all .
i will try to explain
it best i can because to my knowledge ,
no other film have done it
though it is a great technique.think of `` yellow '' as a living thing ,
actual event in 14 scene .
a complete tale.think of `` blue '' as all the thing in between the 14 scene in `` yellow ''
that you did not see ,
that is a complete tale on it is own.essentially
they are parallel film ...
the same story ,
told in two different way.it was not until i saw the first 30 minute of `` blue ''
that i fully understood `` yellow '' i hope this was helpful for person
who are being discouraged by various influence ,
because this film changed the way
i looked at film.thank for your time .
