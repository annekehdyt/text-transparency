only seen season 1 so far but this is just great ! !
a wide variety of person stuck on a island .
nobody are who they seem to be
and everybody seems to have load of skeleton in their closet ... .
it sounds like melrose place meets
the crusoe family and why is that so great ?
it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x file 
a dose of `` what '' ? ?
and a big `` hey '' and a island
that is everything you ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmare
and you will be lost to .
the story got so many twist
and turns
it is unbelievable .
great set up 
solid acting with a liberating acceptance
that at the end of the everybody is human
( well almost everybody ... i think ... )
with good and bad side .
but weird oh so weird ...
