this is one a most famous movie of the french sexual empowerment of the seventy 
starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic role .
it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventy/eighties 
such as `` serie noire '' 
`` buffet froid '' 
`` beau pere '' ,
all
realized by blier.however ,
i would like to correct the previous comment
that was posted on the movie :
the translated title in english is very far from the french version .
it is true that both protagonist are `` going place '' ,
but the title in french could be literally translated by `` the waltz dancer '' ,
which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicle ...
