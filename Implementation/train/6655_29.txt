as a south african 
it is an insult
to think
that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense !
despite the fact
that the director was one of the writer for the original shaka zulu mini ,
this `` addition '' to the series is appalling !
the original series was based on historical
fact about a man
who was a great strategist 
leader and warrior .
a man
who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribe in south africa.the plot of this film 
however ,
is nothing but hogwash 
scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer
that has failed to impress
since the mid-nineties.while omar sharif and henry cele are good actor ,
what is david hasselhoff doing here 
rescuing drowning slave with his red buoy and bleached smile ?
i kept expecting blond 
busty woman
to appear out of nowhere
and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suit ,
for no apparent reason .
not that this would 've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line
that was probably dreamed up after 10 pint of beer at a fancy dress party ,
where someone 's caveman costume inspired the writer
to return to an african theme for his next `` blockbuster '' .
