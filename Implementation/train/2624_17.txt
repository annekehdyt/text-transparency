i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety
that the film is never quite as funny 
lively or insightful about the creative process
as its premise would seem to warrant .
narratively
it is messy
and the lighting is really problematic .
if the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting does not enhance the acting
and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expression of the actor .
many non-south african will have difficulty
in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process .
i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year .
comment and reaction to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the film about our painful past .
unfortunately bunny chow will not be remembered as one of the ight light of the south african new wave ,
but some of the remarkable film about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history .
not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two week after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng .
it has clearly limited appeal among south african audience .
