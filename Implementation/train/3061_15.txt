there were time during the movie i wish
i had been beat to death .
the only reason
i endured the entirety of the movie
was
because i could not believe
how bad it really was
and thought
it must get better .
this truly was a horror film .
i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hour of my life
that i will never get back .
the other two hour i spent mourning at the loss .
please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture
and tell them the suspense will kill them .
