i am of `` the christopher reeve generation ''
it is fair to say
that he was the best actor to play superman yet ,
but that does not stop me from enjoying other actor in the role ,
and george reeve makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top ,
though he just barely falls short .
that does not stop me from enjoying this film ,
it has a lot going for it .
it has all that a movie needs 
a plot with beginning 
middle 
and end ,
plus all those part are intelligently written .
the film is edgy both in acting and storyline 
something a film-noir but with tight .
the story is both exciting and meaningful ,
this is a movie with a message
that is not too preachy .
i am still amazed this was shot over 12 day 
oh the glory day of hollywood ,
when we did not have to wait 5 year
just to see
if the movie would fall into development hell ...
the film is polished and expertly made ,
directed by lee `` roll'em '' sholem ,
best known for directing with both speed and efficiency .
it never lets the constraint of technology slow it down ,
in fact there is some creative thing
done to create the effect of flight ,
including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast
to make it look like
we are seeing it from superman 's point of view ,
also a few closeup of george in process work 
and a long shot of an animated superman .
this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeve television series .
a dvd worth owning in its own right ,
the inclusion of the film as its original whole 
is icing on the cake.give blood today god bless !
