director dougla sirk score again with this 
the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family film .
this lush 
trashy saga is a masterpiece ,
beautifully
combining all of the element of sirk 's soaper and strategically placing them all into one movie .
`` written on the wind '' very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series `` dallas '' and `` dynasty '' ,
as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.lauren bacall 
wonderfully and subtly 
play lucy moore 
a new york city secretary
who marries oil baron 
kyle hadley
( robert stack ) .
unbeknownst to both of them 
mitch wayne
( rock hudson )
is also in love with the quiet 
but sexy secretary .
they all go back to kyle 's family 's mansion in texas
where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister 
marylee
( dorothy malone in an oscar-winning turn ) .
yipee !
the spark begin to fly - from the romance to the catfight ,
this is a campy trip .
not only does mitch have to fight the feeling
he has for his best friend 's wife ,
but marylee try to sleep with everybody
since she can not have her one true love
who is mitch .
topping it all off ,
kyle learn he is impotent ,
but somehow lucy ends up pregnant.this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment .
how can you not love it ?
this film signals one of universal 's most popular film and one of director sirk 's best work .
some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling
and visual metaphor are thrown in every
which way -
the theme of wind throughout is great .
the cast is great ,
although bacall is completely underused
despite receiving top-billing behind hudson .
stack 's oscar loss reportedly devastated him .
he considered this his finest performance
and apparently was none too pleased to lose out .
and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic .
what a stunning movie !
this film proves
what i have been thinking for age -
sirk is the master of classic melodrama .
where is his oscar ?
