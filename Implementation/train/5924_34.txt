time has not been kind to this movie .
once controversial adaptation of jeffrey konvitz ' best-seller ,
now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest .
gruesome touch aside
( particularly that crazy 
over the top finale ) 
this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those person
that do not care much for the genre .
it has an extraordinary cast in small role
( jose ferrer 
ava gardner 
eli wallach 
burgess meredith 
christopher walken 
and many other ) ,
but something tell me
that the producer wanted such an expensive cast
in order to convince the audience
that this is not your average lowow movie
( producer of '70 disaster movie had a similar idea ) .
i kind liked to see the familiar faces ,
but the story is very silly ,
and no matter how high class the film pretends to be ,
it operates at the level of your average '70 exploitation movie
( not an entirely bad thing 
though ) .
still 
it is an enjoyable movie 
especially for those viewer
who enjoy stargazing .
as usual 
albert whitlock 's matte work is outstanding .
overall 
pretty entertaining .
