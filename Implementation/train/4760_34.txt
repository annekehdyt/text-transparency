i thought
this movie did a down right good job .
it was not as creative or original as the first ,
but who was expecting it to be .
it was a whole lotta fun .
the more i think
about it the more i like it ,
and
when it comes out on dvd i am going to pay the money
for it very proudly 
every last cent .
sharon stone is great ,
she always is ,
even if her movie is horrible
( catwoman ) ,
but this movie is not ,
this is one of those movie
that will be underrated for its lifetime ,
and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yr. do not wait for it to be a classic ,
watch it now
and enjoy it .
do not expect a masterpiece 
or something
that gripping and soul touching 
just allow yourself to get out of your life
and get yourself involved in theirs.all in all ,
this movie is entertaining and i recommend person
who have not seen it see it ,
because what the critic and box office say
does not always count ,
see it for yourself ,
you never know ,
you might just enjoy it .
i tip my hat to this movie8/10
