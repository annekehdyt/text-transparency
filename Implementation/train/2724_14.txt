not only is this film entertaining 
with excellent comedic acting ,
but also interesting politically .
it was made at the end of the soviet union ,
but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through .
the story is set during the early day of the soviet union ,
and it question
the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical term .
of course 
by the late 80s and early 90s 
the bizarre stricture of soviet society are already relaxed ,
but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well-deserved deconstruction .
happily 
all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package ! jur
