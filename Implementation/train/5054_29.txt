`` mad dog time '' ... '' trigger happy ''
whatever you wan na call
it ... simply does not hit the mark .
maybe its just me ,
maybe i just do not like gangster comedy
( as i thought oscar 
johney dangerously and mafia also sucked )
it is probably more `` witty sharp wordplay '' than all out comedy ,
only its not as witty and sharp as it
( or the other reviewer )
make it out to be .
the rick 
mick 
vic thing was old
to begin with making it a running gag was at time painful to watch .
there was not enough change of location or feel for the period
they were
supposed to be in .
the majority of the film was either set in `` dreyfus 's club '' or a variety of office /dim room ...
( what was with that sit down gun stand off thing
goldblum kept winning ? )
the supporting cast was ... on paper excellent
( great to see silva and drago )
but character were killed off
before they had time to develop .
and richard pryor cameo was a joke !
the romance and love element of the film also bogged
it down.4/10 i do not think
i will return to it anytime soon .
