this is a really heart-warming family movie .
it has absolutely illiant animal training and `` acting ''
( if you can call it like that )
as well
( just think about the dog in `` how the grinch stole christmas '' ...
it was plain bad training ) .
the paulie story is extremely well done ,
well reproduced and in general the character are really elaborated too .
not more to say
except that this is a great movie ! my rating :
story 8.5/10 
acting 7.5/10 
animals+fx 8.5/10 
cinematography 8/10.my overall rating :
8/10 - big family movie and very worth watching !
