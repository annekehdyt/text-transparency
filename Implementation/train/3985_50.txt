the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good ,
but still not work
if the audience does not believe
that the actor is portraying the person .
that is the main issue with `` young mr. lincoln : ''
henry fonda gives a terrific performance ,
but i found it hard to believe
that aaham lincoln was as soft-spoken
as fonda portray him.this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young aaham licoln at the forefront .
whether or not this was a true story ,
i do not know ,
but if it is not ,
then why tell it using lincoln as the central character ?
never mind though .
in the film 
lincoln is defending two young man
who are accused of murder.there
is really not much to the film ,
and as a result 
it seems rather empty .
i wanted more story and character developmant .
the film is 100 minute long ,
but it does not feel like it .
there are some little scene featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd ,
but they seem superficial.the acting is good all around ,
but as i said ,
fonda 's performance works as a character 
but not aaham lincoln .
i just do not believe
that the real lincoln was that soft-spoken .
true 
he has a big voice
when he needs to ,
such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob
to let the accused stand trial ,
but fonda portray lincoln too meekly .
the other performance are solid though 
especially alice brady as abigail clay 
the mother of the accused .
she is a nice lady
who we can really feel for .
simple and uneducated 
yet very sweet ; we can see
why lincoln wanted to help her.john ford seems to think of this film as an epic 
and at the time of its release 
it probably was .
but even then 
there is just not enough material to present it
as such.it is a nice watch ,
but not a classic .
