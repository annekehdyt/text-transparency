clara bow 's beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason
to watch this film .
`` hula '' is not quite up to par with clara 's best film
but it is still enjoyable .
she dances 
she rides her horse ,
and pursues the man
that she loves .
this film is just over an hour in length
and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming
( gone with the wind )
.the film move quickly
and clara bow has lot of screen time .
if you like clara ,
i would reccomend `` hula . ''
