this show seemed to be kinda good .
kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series ,
but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong .
first of all 
the writer should have more suspect than one ,
you know
who did it every time ! ! ! ! !
that makes it boring .
the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way .
i know
they wanted her to be tough 
but sh mean 
stupid and a bad chief .
the crime are uninteresting and bland ,
and its just lame all the way .
as stated above ,
i hate it ... .
all in all 
this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed ...
