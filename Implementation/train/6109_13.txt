i grew up watching and loving tng .
i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd ,
which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode ,
as the difference in style and approach between the two show could not be more stark .
the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity
to further expand riker 's character ,
which is how it probably would have been treated on voy .
they could have featured memory
that would be `` new '' to the audience 
rather than simply regurgitating old show clip .
the in and out transition between the `` memory '' and the `` present '' in this episode start as clich\u00e9 in the beginning ,
and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wear on and on .
bar none- worst episode ever .
