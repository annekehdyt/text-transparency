i passed this one on the shelf a few time ,
looking at the myriad of huge positive quote
( with tiny name )
on the front
and wondering
if i was missing something .
the other night it was on one of the movie channel 
and i tuned in .
i missed nothing.i must admit
that i only watched the first 30 minute .
perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that .
given the slow 
plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 ,
i seriously doubt it.the lead character
starts the movie in classic `` i do not know how to start my movie '' style 
with a long 
tiresome monologue about how he does not want to get sued .
it is not funny .
it is not even remotely funny .
other have commented on the `` san franclisco '' bit ; ok 
a small chuckle the first time
he says it .
then he grinds it into the ground ,
smiling at the camera like it is the funniest thing ever written .
get over yourself .
in fact 
i think
the talking to the camera bit was the reason
i instantly disliked the film .
do not assume familiarity with your audience .
familiarity is _earned_ ,
much like respect.from there
you basically have a fat whiny guy
talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp .
i did not realize
he is jewish ;
it is a discredit to jewish comedian to call this `` jewish humor '' .
it is just unfunny humor .
just
because you are jewish
does not mean you have a knack for the comedy .
a wasp 
spalding gray 
does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy ,
so obviously
it is not about ethnicity.if one of the bit i
had seen had worked ,
i might have stuck around .
but some schlub going on about how much he loves the name of the woman
he works with ,
then listing them for five long minute ,
does not make a great movie.this is an obvious attempt
to capitalize on the popularity of `` office space '' .
do not let yourself become a victim of target marketing .
just say no to `` haiku tunnel '' .
