this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life .
the pacing 
the camera work 
the emotion 
the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see .
it is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted .
the only flaw i can see about this film is
that it was not captured in a more technically perfect film format .
it deserved todd-ao 
technicolor and the very finest sound format available .
( an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter . )
the gorgeous italian villa effect on its inhabitant would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moment would be even more beautifully seen and heard .
as it is ,
it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film .
i can not stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite .
the transformation of the character from contained 
tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch
and i really should recommend
it more often.the casting is perfect ,
the mood is perfect ,
the acting is above reproach .
it is a film about middle age
and the choice person make.it is deep and thoughtful
without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness .
watch it in one sitting
and let it have its effect on you .
if you do not get it ,
perhaps you have not lived enough ,
or something else is wrong with you .
