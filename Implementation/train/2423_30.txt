apparently 
this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set
while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime ;
as i said earlier ,
although i have always wanted to catch one of paul naschy 's werewolf picture 
this atrocity served as my introduction and 
as awful
as it most certainly is ,
i still intend to pursue other entry in the series 
albeit very gradually.despite some high profile disappointment like joe dante 's the howling
( 1981 ) ,
i love werewolf picture in general but ,
to be honest ,
i quickly lost interest in this film 's `` plot ''
and just stood there gazing at my tv screen counting its absurdity
as it were .
there were far too many to mention them here
but i have to say
two which struck me
as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf persona
( i.e .
going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed 
zombie-like state in the very next one -
as if he is on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside ,
and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot ... and 
yes 
i did know the reason for this beforehand ) 
as well as the `` phantom of the opera '' look of the wolfstein character !
but what do i know -
perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic !
