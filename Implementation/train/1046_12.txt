i really enjoyed this thriller !
i wanted to see it again as soon
as it was over .
the cast was excellent ,
the plot was suspenseful and entertaining ,
and it was just an overall enjoyable movie !
i would rate this
as one of the best thriller i have ever seen !
the girl in it were really cute also 
especially denise richard .
she was very ornery throughout the movie
and gave her character some oomph !
