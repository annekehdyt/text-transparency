a female country singer nicknamed `` big t ''
-- seriously ,
that is what they call her --
risks her budding musical career and her life
by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard
( busey )
who wants to be her manager .
his mother committed suicide 
his father 's an alcoholic as well ,
and he has a violent temper .
you can imagine where that leads .
in the meantime 
there is music aplenty ,
as parton 
with her fluid vocal talent 
belt out song after song
( at least half a dozen of them about texas ) .
steer clear of this mess
and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolia instead .
