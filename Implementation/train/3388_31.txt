there is so much to love in this darling little comedy .
anyone
who has ever built or bought a house ,
or even just been short of space ,
will find
that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr. blanding.melvyn douglas 
with great comedic flare 
both narrate and act as the blanding ' attorney and voice of reason.as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterained but extremely patient wife .
but the best performance is grant 's .
he is the american everyman 
especially relevant at the time of this film 's release ,
when the nation was in the grip of a housing shortage after the end of the war .
the theme are universal 
lack of money 
work strain 
fear of infidelity.ye ,
it does wrap up awfully neatly ,
but you must keep in mind
that this was a time
when the world was just recovering from a terrible war ,
and wanted a happy ending .
it is still relevant today ,
and i must chalk up the poor review i see to a present preference for dumbed down 
gross out comedy .
the look of the film is slick ,
and there are some great bit of comedy is well ,
particularly toward the beginning.while it may have lost some of it
is social relevance ,
nearly sixty year
after it is release ,
it is still a gem .
