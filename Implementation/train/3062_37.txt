most complaint i have heard of this film
really come down to one thing :
it is not versus .
yes 
the cast and crew is basically the same .
yes 
kitamura rehashes a few shot in the fight scene
that come in the film 's second half ,
but that is about where the similarity end .
versus takes place essentially all outside 
showcasing kitamura 's ability
to craft an interesting b-movie in natural location .
for alive 
almost everything takes place inside .
in small 
cramped space .
here the art design is thrust into your face ,
and what art design
it is !
we are treated to several very intricate and interesting space ,
and our character are for the most part confined to those space .
also a key difference is that we do not get much action here until the end of the film .
versus was all about action and cool ,
here a lot more emphasis is put on character and situation and messing with your mind .
because of this 
alive is a far more interesting film than versus .
you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minute of cool zombie bloodshed ,
but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hour
watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting character.i am now ecstatic
that i ordered the dvd
despite some naysay .
you should too !
but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus -
it is often slow ,
and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it .
i hope medium blaster pick
it up for subtitled r1 dvd release !
