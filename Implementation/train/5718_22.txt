beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work ,
and the recreation of the little movie and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious .
according to harron
they used film stock
that is no longer produced and fifty style studio lighting even for the outside location
to give the colour portions its distinctive look .
bettie page saw the movie at hugh heffner 's house
( she is now eighty-three )
with the producer there ,
but not the director ,
in case it got awkward
if she did not like it .
she apparently did like it up until the official inquiry ,
which she found unsettling .
some great costume too .
the idea for the movie started in 1993 ,
but this was worth the wait .
the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those image and snippet of ( dreadful )
movie
that many of us will have already seen .
it would make an interesting companion piece with goodnight and goodluck 
but much more pleasant viewing !
