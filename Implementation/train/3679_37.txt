`` the big goodbye '' introduce us to the first holodeck adventure ,
in this case captain picard
posing as private investigator dixon hill .
this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern ,
repeated several time on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager .
after entering the holodeck something goes wrong
and the character have to deal with the program under different circumstance beyond playing a game
( represented by the failure of the holodeck 's safety program ) .
this concept is used to expand star trek 's possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix .
picard 's dixon hill story are example of 1940s crime fiction
and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead
( see for example chandler 's marlowe story or polanski 's all time classic `` chinatown '' ) .
star trek never focuses on the story
( mostly it is a simple `` how-do-we-get-out-of-here '' scenario )
but enables the actor to take a different approach to their character .
those holodeck `` game '' are commonly used for recreation
and reflect the private interest of the crew member .
therefore the technical aspect is always neglected
and from that point of view the story are never sound
( but did star trek ever had a technical 
scientific point to it ,
i mean besides some utopic concept ? ) .
`` the big goodbye '' shows a relaxed patrick stewart 
a mcfadden
that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode
( at least the early one )
and data has some great scene 
too
( although i find it hard to believe
that pulling the lamp 's plug out of the wall
would have really surprised him 
for the fact
that he had done research on that period and its custom ) .
wesley continues turning peaceful trekky into potential murderer
( why did not they take him to the holodeck
and let the gangster finish him off ? )
but all in all this one 's fun ...
