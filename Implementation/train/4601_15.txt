i wish i could say
that this show was unusual in it is banality ,
but it is usual in every way.it
has the dumb husband 
his smarter but boring and conventional wife 
along with the idiotic sidekick for `` comic '' relief-it sorely needs it.stale predictable joke 
with even more predictable reaction from the laughtrack 
punctuate this noxious mental narcotic 's nauseatingly unimaginative plot line to leave me either physically ill 
or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma .
but it might be on for a while
yet because it gives the average american a personage
to which they can truly identify.a `` regular '' guy just like you and me.i live in the southern u.s ,
so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism.down here ,
that obnoxious character is everywhere ,
in some form or another.seeing him on television is utal overkill .
