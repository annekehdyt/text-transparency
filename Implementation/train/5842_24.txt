for those
who think
it is strictly potty humor and immaturity ,
you are in fact the mindless one .
while the show does contain its share of potty joke
it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problem 
racial barrier 
clich\u00e9 's 
stereotypes etc .
you just need to read into some of her material a bit more
to get it.what i
also love is that not everything is a punchline .
for those expecting a formulated joke like friend
( i love friend fyi ) ,
you will not find it here .
instead sarah use situation and other way
to achieve her humour
which is more realistic .
we do not walk around in this world
and have witty punchline for everything said ,
which is in most comedy .
instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense .
so do not take it as mindless humor
because it is so much more than that .
