i swear
when i first saw this movie ,
i cried my eye out !
a star is born is the movie
that lets you know
what love is really like despite the obstacle john norman
( kris kristofferson )
and esther
( streisand )
face .
you also experience what it is like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie .
streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together
and the music is fantastic !
when streisand sing with one more look at you/watch closely now ,
it is just pure magic !
this movie made the song evergreen one of my favorite ,
and queen bee is such a fun song .
also i love the fashion of the '70s
( except streisand 's afro .
besides that ,
she is a beauty . ) .
a star is born is my number one favorite movie .
this movie is a pleasure to watch
and is a heart-eaker at the end .
