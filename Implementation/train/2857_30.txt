while a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film 
however ,
compared to the hundred and hundred of series detective film from the 1930s and 40s ,
this is among the very best
and also compares very favorably to powell 's later `` thin man '' film .
now this does not mean
that the film is that similar to the thin man movie ,
as the kennel murder case is not a comedy
but more a traditional mystery-detective film .
now you would think
that not having nora charle or asta or a traditional comic sidekick
( something found in practically all series detective film )
along for fun would be a detriment ,
but i did not miss them at all
because this was such an exceptionally well-written film
-- having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performance by all.the film begins at the dog show
and is called the kennel murder case ,
though this philo vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show
and dog are not a super-important part of the film .
instead 
a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room
-- an idea repeated in quite a few other detective film
( such as crime doctor 's strangest case ) .
however 
how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very well
-- keeping my interest throughout .
i sure wish
other detective film of the day had as intelligently written plot
and exceptional acting as this one .
this one is definitely a keeper .
