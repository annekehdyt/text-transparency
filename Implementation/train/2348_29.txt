the movie is actually too slow .
there are some nice image
but it can not outweigh the fact
that the movie is in fact boring .
you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelon and a sexual intercourse
while eating a melon
and maybe a little bit more .
it may sound even interesting to someone
but believe me to watch it for 2 hour is not fun at all .
though you laugh several time
but it is really not enough
and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun .
to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clip into the movie .
they are really colorful clip of absurd song maybe from the 50 's
but it is hard to say exactly
and they are trying to be funny so hard
that it is really sad .
several time you have a feeling
that the plot could evolve into something ,
that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporate
and that is it .
beside the clip there are hardly any dialogs let alone music .
the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost .
personally i can not recommend the movie .
i believe
that art is something
that should not be boring .
during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema
which just corroborates my short review .
