i loved dedee pfeiffer
( is that spelled right ? )
in cybil .
have not seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her .
i thought
she did a great job in this .
the supporting cast was pretty good too .
in some angle 
the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman .
the abductor was pretty creepy
and the story generally had some good twist .
the young boyfriend was a hottie .
i thought
the husband definitely had something to do with it
for sure.just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movie .
kept my interest and i will watch it again
when they rerun it .
can anyone else recommend any similar movie to this ?
you can post on the board or send me a private email
if you want .
thank in advance .
