i could not keep from commenting
after reading the very short `` not bad '' commentary .
this movie is much better
than just not bad .
the acting is stellar 
even from the child in the cast ,
who do not play cute or anything else
but act just like my son 's friend .
the movie is smart
and expects
it is audience to be as well .
the double back flash story line are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler .
i watched this movie with my kid
and then i watched it again
by myself a few day later .
if you have kid
and are sick to death of movie
that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness ,
then check out `` hole . ''
my 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old ,
and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them .
how many movie can you say that about ?
