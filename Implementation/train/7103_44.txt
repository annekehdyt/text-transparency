what is written on the poster is :
`` at birth he was given 6 year to live ... at 34
he takes the journey of a lifetime . ''
ami is an american-born israeli
who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one .
at age of 34 
after the love toward his 22 year old care-giver did not go well ,
he decided to come to the us to face the doctor
who said
that he would have only 6 year to live .
he wanted to show the doctor
that he is still alive ,
and weight 39 pound .
why ?
your guess is as good as mine ,
even i have seen this film.obviously
it is courageous to live
when all he can move is his left index finger ,
but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor
who diagnosed his disease 34 year ago ?
his doctor just told his mom
that based on the medical history ,
person with his disease will not live long .
what is the point of him
showing up at old doctor 's door for ?
why is tracking down this old doctor
in the us is a journey of his lifetime ?
there are so many thing
we might be interested in ami 's life :
how can he make those animation with the movement of only one finger ?
how can he go through daily life
while totally depending on other ?
how did he out lived his doctor 's prediction ?
how does he deal emotionally
when other person look at him like looking at a strange creature ?
the movie told us none of that .
instead 
the filmmaker got a van
and set up a trip
to let ami to show up at his old doctor 's door
in order to show him
that he is still alive .
i thought
it was a joke .
