this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movie .
horrible .
there was not a continuous minute
where there was not a fight with one monster or another .
there was no chance for any character development ,
they were too busy running from one sword fight to another .
i had no emotional attachment
( except to the big bad machine
that wanted to destroy them )
scene were blatantly stolen from other movie 
lotr 
star war and matrix .
example > the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star war with yoda 
obee one and vader .
> the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the king .
( elijah wood is the victim in both film )
and wait ... ... it hypnotizes
( sting )
its victim and wraps them up ... ..uh hello ? ? ?
? > and the whole machine vs. human theme was the matrix..or terminator ...
..there are more example
but why waste the time ?
and will someone tell me what was with the nazi 's ? ! ? !
nazi 's ? ? ? ?
there was a juvenile story line
rushed to a juvenile conclusion .
the movie could not decide
if it was a child 's movie or an adult movie
and was not much of either .
just awful .
a real disappointment
to say the least .
save your money .
