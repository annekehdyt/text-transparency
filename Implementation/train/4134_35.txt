`` opening night ''
released in 1977 ,
tries to be an ambitious production .
it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of gena rowland .
her character of theatre actress myrtle is not necessarily someone
we would love in real life .
she is self-absorbed 
often obnoxious ,
and makes life miserable for those around her - in other word ,
not unlike some actress !
myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse -
we are not quite sure
if the demon she is fighting are real or imagined ,
although we are let in on the secret early .
rowland is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband 
actor/director john cassavette ,
who has a role in the film as well .
this film is not
without flaw -
it is overly long ,
and the last part of the film
where myrtle goes on stage
while very drunk seems almost cruel .
the `` improvising '' in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long .
some of the supporting character give good performance 
especially from ben gazarra ,
playing myrtle 's sleazy producer .
joan blondell 's character is never fully developed ,
and i never could figure out why
she was in the film 
except to placate myrtle .
see this film for rowland alone -
she is fascinating throughout -
and it is tough to take your eye off her ,
although you will want to at time .
