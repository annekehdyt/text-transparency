of the spate of austen film from the 1990s 
this is my favorite 
more even than `` persuasion 
''
which was the one
that converted me to austeniana .
before seeing this `` emma '' i had seen two previous version ,
but in one emma seemed all wrong 
more like lady teazle 
and in the other she seemed half wrong ,
like a possible impostor 
whereas here she seemed just right 
young and silly and stubborn .
in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well ;
indeed it is one of the sweetest ,
merriest thing i have ever seen 
rather in the nature of a christmas treat .
the script is unusually well formed ,
and the adapter 's addition 
like the shaft of light
that reveals harriet to emma in church ,
are all in keeping .
mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected ,
but i enjoyed him very much :
he strongly ings out the plain-spoken 
practical side of the character 
in contrast with emma 's affectation ,
and his choleric outburst against frank churchill are quite funny .
bernard hepton makes mr. woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity ;
samantha morton as emma 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is exactly as soft and exactly as firm
as she ought to be .
and as in the same producer ' `` pride and prejudice 
'' care is taken
that the eventual coupling of character can be believed
-- uniquely in some case .
for me this production was
and remains a delight .
