- let me start by saying
that i understand
that invasion of the star creature was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi film of the 50s .
i understand
that none of it is to be taken seriously .
the problem i have is that none of it works .
a parody should be funny
and this one just is not .
not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile .
in general 
i am easily entertained ,
but i could not find a sliver of entertainmant anywhere in invasion of the star creature.- i knew
i was in trouble right from the beginning .
the two `` star '' make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable
- a water hose
they can not control
that gets them both wet .
these two come off as bowery boys wannabe .
why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me .
after the less than illustrious beginning 
the movie goes on to feature comical chase sequence 
dancing indian 
vegetable man 
decoder ring 
and other assorted unfunny bit .
it is all just a complete waste of time.- i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girl .
that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creature .
