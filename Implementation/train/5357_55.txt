more a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time
than your typical dragged out biopic ,
this fun and fabulous film has the look
and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack
and everything you would want in an indie-type film .
i think
the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex vixen 
like a jayne mansfield .
but if you have truly looked carefully at bettie 's pose ,
she always looked happy .
not a `` you wish you could get with me '' haughty look ,
nor the `` i am just doing this
because my acting career did not work out '' look of a porn star .
and so 
the lady involved with this film
( three female producer 
a female writer/ director 
female co-writer and the lovely gretchen mol ,
who i am sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence )
really captured the idea of a sweet 
somewhat naive 
southern girl
who really enjoyed having her photo taken
and hoped
that good ol ' jc would not be too upset with her .
gretchen mol turns out a career high performance
( she may just have the most perfect east ever ) ,
which i am happy about ,
because she did have the curse .
several year ago 
she made the cover of vanity fair
when no one really knew
who she was ,
touting her as the next it-girl .
and let 's be frank ,
that was a bit presumptuous .
i mean unfortunately
she has never made it to gwyneth status 
though not for lack of talent .
making a few poor film choice
when you are a pretty blonde in fickle hollywood render
you forgettable i
am afraid .
if this does not put her back on the a-list ,
well i will be a monkey 's uncle.intensely private ,
bettie herself has not seen the film yet .
bettie left the pinup party on a high note
and fell in love with her old flame 
jesus .
whatever float your boat honey .
you were one helluva woman .
i hope
you are happy wherever
you are.congratulations mary harron ,
you have done our cult idol justice .
