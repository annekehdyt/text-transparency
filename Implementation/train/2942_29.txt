some film
that you pick up for a pound
turn out to be rather good - 23rd century film released dozen of obscure italian and american movie
that were great ,
but although hardgore released some fulci film amongst other ,
the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles.the only positive
thing i can say
about this film is that it is nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh .
other than that 
its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house
built by a whelk.it
is been noted elsewhere ,
but you really do have to worry about a film
that inserts preview of the action into its credit sequence ,
so by the time
it gets to the zombie attack ,
you have seen
it all already.bad movie fan will have a ball
watching the 18,000 continuity mistake and the diabolical acting of the cast
( especially the hitchhiker ,
who was so bad
he did make me laugh a bit ) ,
and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of thing by releasing a print so bad it felt
like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.awful 
awful stuff .
we have all made stuff like this
when we have gotten a hold of a camera 
but common sense prevail and these film languish in our cupboard somewhere .
avoid .
