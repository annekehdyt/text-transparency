hmm 
imdb rating of 7.5 
good comment 
bla 
bla ... okay 
two of my friend and me ,
we orderd pizza ,
sat down
and wanted to see something as cool as ichi or at least something ainless
but funny like versus .
but naked blood sucked .
it is a complete waste .
okay 
the scene with the woman
who likes to eat
is quite outstanding .
but that is it .
nothing more 
nothing less .
i will not summerize the plot ,
other person
did already ,
i just wanted to stop the hype .
but watch it and rate for yourself .
maybe we can push the rating
where it sould be .
one more thing
that comes to my mind :
the soundtrack is even worse
than carpenter ever
was - okay 
john 's cool ... : )
2/10
