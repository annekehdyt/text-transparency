first of all 
i are not american or middle-eastern .
second of all 
i do not have a religion .
the closest thing to a religion i have are sport and movie .
henceforth 
i believe
i would be best served
to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias.most of these short film are an utter disgrace .
this dreadful event should be used
to commemorated all those innocent person
whom were murdered by `` some '' barbaric and uncivilized moron .
instead 
most of what i saw in these short film were conceited attempt to score varied political point .
examples:1 )
ken loach 's segment .
sure 
we are all sad
that this dude had a hard life in his country
but what has that got to do with the innocent victim of 2001 ?
two wrong do not make a right ? !
whatever !
this film should have a subtitle for those
who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean-english accent.2 )
most disturbing is youssef chahine 's segment .
it is obvious
that he has trouble with logic .
he justified the murder due to - america
being a democracy
and because some american voted the politician in power ,
then all american in the end are responsible for the action and decision
made by their leader on the middle-east .
helloooo !
is this guy for real ? ?
some american do not even vote !
some american do not even know
where the middle-east is ;
some do not even know
what religion is practiced there ;
and majority do not know the real political issue
that are played behind the scene .
# # # mr chahine 
the reason why
we have all these problem in the world
is because there are too many person with your kind of logic .
the innocent victim in the twin tower came from around the world .
the murdered firefighter 
rescuer 
office worker 
by-stander and flight passenger have nothing to do with politic .
and yet 
we are not allowed to go about our life
because `` some '' person think
everyone has to choose a side or a religion .
we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politic.3 )
the israeli segment showed their own bombed victim .
another filmmaker using this event
to push their own political agenda .
sometimes 
it is not about you .
some person always think about the `` me 
me 
me . ''
sometimes 
it is about other person.4 )
idrissa ouedraogo 's segment is a joke and another political point scorer .
they obviously want money from the international community
by highlighting their poverty .
blah 
blah 
blah.this movie denigrates the memory of `` sept. 11th 
2001 '' victim.the best thing
for it is the trash can .
