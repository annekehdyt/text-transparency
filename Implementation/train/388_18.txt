a pleasant surprise !
i expected a further downgrade along the line :
the rock
( 9 )
-- > con air
( 7 ) --
> armaggeddon
( 4 ) .
especially for such an overhyped film .
perhaps that is the reason
so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare .
clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liner 
decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotype
and when the chase came you really thirsted for it .
fanboy expecting an armageddon rollercoaster :
stay away .
this is one for the more intelligent action fan .
it did not even bother me jolie appeared so little .
