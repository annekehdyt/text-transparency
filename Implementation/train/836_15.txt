in a not so conventional sense of the word.this movie was one of my favorite as a young child ,
and i just recently remembered it ,
and thought to look it up .
while many of the detail are no longer clear in my mind 
the overall feeling
that
the movie gave me
has stuck with me over the years.if parent feel
that their child can handle mature
and sometimes violent theme ,
then i highly recommend this movie .
it taught me a lot about life and death ,
and ought forth in me a lot of emotion .
to this day ,
it remains one of my favorite film .
