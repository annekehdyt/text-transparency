there is an excellent reason
edison went straight to video :
it would have landed in theater with a crumbling thud .
the movie lasted entirely too long
and was perilously boring .
just a notch above lowow
( thank to freeman and spacey ,
who obviously had a spare two week before their next film ) ,
the bad guy are as laughable and action as near non-existent as justin timberlake 's acting .
i hate to knock the guy ,
but the sooner he realizes
that pop is his forte ,
the better.the movie is not all bad ... just mostly .
i like the fact
that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man .
he deserves it .
and 
unlike his fellow musician and co-star 
he can act .
kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well
( you can see him gulp several time
as he chews the scenery ) ,
and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three star
( out of ten ...
he is not that good )
.when all is said
and done 
the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock
that fails to keep anyone awake .
it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the character .
all in all 
t 's just plain boring .
that being said ,
rent this when you are suffering from insomnia .
