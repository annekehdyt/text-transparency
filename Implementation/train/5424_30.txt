`` if i wanted to dribble ,
i would call a nurse . ''
`` have not you had enough ? ''
... '' more than enough .
`` `` you got me a choo-choo .
`` `` if i begin to die ,
please remove
( the cowboy hat )
from my head .
that is not the way i wish to be remembered . ''
some of the wonderfully humorous 
and often insightful 
quotation from this charming and often insightful film .
dudley moore is charming 
lovable and rich .
sir john gielgud is aristocratic 
charming and loving ... and poor .
the two have a non-father/father and son relationship
which defines the man
whom arthur is to become .
will he follow his heart and soul 
or just his wealth ?
over twenty-five year 
i have returned to this movie 
with glee and amusement and joy .
it is a movie to return to 
time and time again ,
and remember what is important in life ,
as short as it is .
