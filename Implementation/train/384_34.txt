my friend and i rented this for `` bad movie night '' with high hope ,
but the brain was something of a letdown .
the brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking ,
but it mostly just sit on its little platform .
who thought
that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three person throughout 94 drawn-out minute ?
this movie has a number of thing going for it at first ,
including an estevez-knockoff lead
playing a rebellious genius
( we are told
that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate prank and school stunt ,
which include putting krazy glue on someone 's chair ) .
it also has some great line 
a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-eath henchman
who just barely manages to be everywhere ,
and 
yeah 
some chick gets naked .
however 
the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing .
during the last half thing just start to drag on and on 
with at least 3 or 4 pointless 
boring chase scene making up the middle third of the plot .
the scene inside the pri complex are especially bad .
at least 15 minute of this movie are person running up
and down the same stairwell .
i could have fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese 
more gore 
more nudity 
more brain action .
if you are going to make a bad horror movie ,
at least give me something cool
to look at while my superego shuts down .
maybe the director was trying to really ing the audience into his movie- i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest .
