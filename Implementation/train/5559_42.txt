now either you like mr carrey 's humour or you do not .
me 
myself and irene had audience both walking out in drove and 
on the other hand 
cheering and collapsing in puddle of mirth .
bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream ,
but you have been warned.if
you are not sure 
watch the trailer .
i saw the trailer three time
and still laughed at the same gags
when i saw the film .
if you do not find the sight of a dog
putting the seat down
after using the loo funny ,
do not bother with the movie.carrey ,
a reporter stuck in a rut
covering 'lighter news ' berate god
when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot .
god takes up the challenge
and asks carrey
if he can do better .
carrey gets into the swing
of having all of god 's power
by making his girlfriend
( jennifer aniston )
's east bigger 
getting himself promoted ,
and answering everyone 's prayer by single stroke computer commands.this is not a highow movie or even that memorable ,
but it is very well made within
it is very limited intent ,
provides almost continuous laugh to carrey fan ,
and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadder and anti-god-squadder.on the more thoughtful level 
the film tempts us to speculate about carrey 's own career -
stuck in his 'comedy ' typecasting
he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor
even after winning two golden globe .
his most accomplished 'straight ' role 
the man on the moon 
is less well
known that his comedy romp - or the truman show
( on which the academy heaped three nomination whilst bypassing carrey ) .
