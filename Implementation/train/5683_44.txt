this one grew on me .
i love the r.d .
burman music and in spite of the cruder element of the story i found much to be moved by
as i kept re-watching the movie .
the other-sister plot line is powerful ,
i thought ;
there is also more probably obligatory stuff 
like bar fight 
a loony crime story 
etc .
that are just distracting .
( though not unfunny from a certain point of view . )
also the english translation is definitely by someone
for whom it was a bit of a stretch ,
and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it.like many of the bollywood movie i
have seen ,
this one is melodramatic and opera-like ,
including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister ,
and then the same song sung 12 or so year later by the man
who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl ,
grown up and troubled
( she had been told her other and mother
were dead ) ,
numbing her pain with drugs.a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement ,
which ought horde of seeker to india 
from an indian point of view ,
that sees them as person driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failing of their own society 
but nonetheless 
in india ,
living only for the pleasure of the moment .
the hippie singing-dancing-drugging scene are truly wonderful ,
and accurate in their tone
( i am old enough to remember ) ,
and i feel pretty sure
that the mass of young white zoned-out kid are actual hippie extra ,
as i remember
hearing about kid on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood .
( it is not about the actual hare krishna movement ,
though the movie hippie sing a krishna/rama chant ,
as do a group of actual indian devotee ,
unrelated to the hippie 
in the opening scene of the movie .
