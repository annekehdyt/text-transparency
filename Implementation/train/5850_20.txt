this is an astounding film .
as well as showing actual footage of key event in the failed coup to oust chavez ,
we are given the background picture
which describes a class-divided society .
many of the rich ,
it appears ,
have a choice with the person 's democratic choice ,
and are willing to use the military for regime change .
'be careful what you say
in front of your servant ' is a revealing comment .
the head of the country 's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president 
with us backing ,
and these young irish film maker have it all on camera .
a great film
to educate young person about democracy .
we see transparent documentation of how medium can be manipulated ,
and force used 
in the interest of big business 
against the interest of the democratic wish of the person .
riveting stuff .
