my all-time favorite movie !
i have seen many movie ,
but this one beats them all !
excelent acting 
wonderful story .
you will ,
as a `` normal '' caring person start to love george .
altough he is an actor ,
he is also himself and a very lovable person .
and maby most important thing :
you will learn to respect and look different to person with down syndrome .
