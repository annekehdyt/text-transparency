`` you are the dumbest smart person
i have ever met .
`` calvin- `` well 
i had a ain ,
but they lost it in the re-write .
`` i think
what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov 's work
was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed .
in the book 
she was actually one of the first strong female protagonist ,
able to think her way through a problem .
here she is just a damsel in distress ,
waiting to be rescued by wil smith.there
are passing reference to asimov 's law of robotic ,
but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes.smith is likable ,
as he is in most of his film ,
but honestly ,
the story is not that good .
you figure it out long before these genius character do .
