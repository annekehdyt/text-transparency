this was such a waste of time .
danger :
if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave
it thru the window.an amateur production :
terrible 
repetitive 
vacuous dialog ; paper-thin plot line ; wooden performance ; lucy lawless was pathetically hackneyed.seriously flawed story 
completely unbelievable character .
the two worst concept in film and t.v .
are :
( 1 )
the evil twin ,
( 2 )
amnesia .
there are no twins.the plot `` twist '' ?
outrageously simplistic and obvious -
like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairy .
it does not even resolve properly .
the evil is not punished for the original crime.please 
please ,
please - do not watch this
even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue .
