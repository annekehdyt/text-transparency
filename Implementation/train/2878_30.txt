shocking ! in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive .
he was sincere 
unpretentious and kindly ,
he was at ease
and looked like well-educated and intellectual person .
in this movie i saw a clown !
the actor looks like dummy with affected gesture and mimicry .
they made a cartoon !
the real gagarin was someone else !
do not believe in this movie !
i saw this movie after the movie like `` taming of fire '' and `` apollo 13 ''
and after reading book `` rocket and person '' by chertok and `` korolev :
myth and fact '' by golovanov .
i was shocked by tiresome scenario 
poor acting and producing ,
and a lot of inexactitude of `` space race '' .the movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in russia historical fact .
a lot of interesting known fact of the space project was not demonstrated .
some fact and detail were perverted .
for example 
in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner
( liberated in 1944 ) ,
and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine 
but in special prison design bureau .
korolev was the designer in prison design bureau
and he was not buried the dead prisoner .
but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940
( because jailer have shoulder strap on uniform ) .
imho 
the author of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history
and they can not to make interesting movie .
