this movie was bizarre 
completely inexplicable 
and hysterical to watch with friend
while drinking in a big empty house .
i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering
about lost in a gorgeous city .
i want to be a beautiful stranger
lost in some exotic european locale ,
though maybe not in a low budget horror flick .
definitely get the ending
where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scene
that were cut out
( in my dvd copy anyway ) .
do not attempt to understand it ,
just go along and watch out for the weird bit ...
which is everything .
do not watch this if
you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all
to make sense .
pretty beautiful 
though you may just give up on this
and decide to watch an actual horror movie ,
like say 
dead alive .
