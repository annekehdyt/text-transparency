where do i begin ?
i wanted to enjoy this movie ,
and i did .
still 
i wanted to be able to enjoy it
for being another zombie film
that was worth my loot ,
and it was not .
this was a different kind of enjoyment .
this was unhealthy 
a perverse glee
that i partook in watching one of the most ridiculous film id
seen yet .
and i do not much care for whatever fulci 's excuse were ,
there was no excuse for this film going how it went .
this was a bad film all the way around ,
yet i still can not give it below a 4 out of ten ,
which is what i gave it ,
because well ... at least i was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie.i
had to imagine these zombie ,
that were all over the ceiling of these building everywhere ...
had to imagine
that they were either bored as hell
so they crawled up on the beems 
and perched themselves high on stone erection ,
or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk-off coming around ,
so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambush .
hell 
what else is there to do
when you are dead ?
i had to laugh at some zombie performing what looked to be martial art swing 
kick 
and jump 
and some shambling about like traditional meatlover .
i feasted my eye on a floating head
that was never explained .
i watched in pure horrific delight as the land
they were in 
the phillipenis ,
was absolutely engulfed in fog 
heavy dose of fog ,
and that the pond were
as they were boiling castle moat .
i had to even cringe
when i saw
that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with line stretching from each angle 
with `` dead one ''
written in the middle .
i had to ask myself ...
if the science of curing zombie is that easy 
then i wonder
if i could come up with a little something
to start a zombie outeak here !
all in all the effect were overboard 
the dubbing horrid 
im sure the original acting as poor 
the story absurd 
the zombie inconsistent 
even in a bad way
they could
have all been similar 
and the woman ugly ,
but i found myself enjoying this thing .
it was a fun watch .
it turned out to be a very very bad film ,
and i would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation film ,
but still ,
again i say
... it was worth a good laugh .
i crave zombie film no matter what ,
but when this had fulci 's name
attached to it ,
it should have been much better .
let me dare say ,
zombie holocaust was better .
