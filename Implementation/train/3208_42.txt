having not read the novel ,
i can not tell how faithful this film is .
the story is typical mystery material :
killer target newlyweds ;
woman investigator falls in love with her partner
and is diagnosed with a fatal disease .
yes 
it sounds like a soap opera
and that is exactly how it plays .
the first 2/3 are dull ,
save for the murder and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback
as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.acting is strictly sub par ,
though it is hard to blame the actor alone :
the screenplay is atrocious .
during the last 1/3 you stop noticing
because the film actually becomes interesting ,
but that is only the last 1/3 .
director russell mulcahy is very much in his element ,
but there is only so much
he can do with a tv budget and the network censor on his back .
he is pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted len ,
though he managed to squeeze in a couple `` under the floor ''
shot during the murder in the club restroom .
unfortunately ,
as this is made for tv ,
the cool compositional detail
he uses so well with a wider image
are nowhere to be found .
note to producer :
give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic len
when you hire him.summing it up :
this film is bad by cinema standard and mediocre by tv standard
( watch csi 
instead ) .
if you are in the mood for a film like this ,
i have some excellent suggestion :
pick up a copy of dario argento 's `` deep red ''
( my highest recommendation ;
superb film ) ,
`` opera '' 
or even `` tenee '' .
they are stronger in every category .
