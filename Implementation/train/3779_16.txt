hey hulu.com is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site
and this movie is their under the name monsteroid 
good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie ... .have fun with bad movie .
anyway this movie really has very little value other
than to see
how bad the 70 's were for horror flick bad effect ,
bad dialog 
just bad movie
making .
avoid this unless you want to laugh at it .
while you are at hulu check out the other movie
that are their right
now there is 10 episode
and some are pretty decent movie with good plot and production
and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long
as you have a decent speed connection .
