probably the worst bollywood film i have seen.no plot line .
very little character developments.full of silly and pointless humor .
the whole film was chaotic and direction-less .
there was no proper ending to the story .
the airport was filmed in a shopping mall .
same story chewed over and over again
until you want to say `` please ,
just move on with it ! ! ''
even the song and dance was pointless
and badly choreographed.the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bod all around ...
but then most of the bollywood movie have that anyways these days.btw i am not from an indian background2/10
