i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental ,
thinking
that the cover looked quite nice .
and it was nice ,
but the movie is trash .
i can handle b-grade ,
i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp
( ie .
'surf nazis must die ' is a classic example
of how entertaining the genre can be ) ,
but this was just bland bland bland .
incredibly dull scene were oken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequence .
this movie has very little to offer .
