if you are a fan of altman 's large ensemble cast ,
as evidenced in major film like m.a.s.h. 
nashville 
gosford park ,
and lesser seen film like a wedding ,
then you will no doubt be entertained by health .
centered around a health convention
where two woman are running for president ,
health contain many of altman 's latter 70s regular like paul dooley
( who helped write the film ) ,
carol burnett 
and henry gibson ,
while also including top star altman newcomer like lauren bacall 
jame garner 
and glenda jackson .
like a lot of altman ensemble film there are numerous subplot in this film ,
but it is not nearly as overwhelming as film like nashville or a wedding ,
rather it has a more centered feel 
perhaps like m.a.s.h .
or gosford park .
the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement ,
filled with over-top 
outlandish 
contradictive character ,
with guest star like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing .
underlining the whole election process is altman 's characteristic pessimism about politic and public appeal
but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun
most person seem to be having .
this would be one of altman 's last film like this for a while !
