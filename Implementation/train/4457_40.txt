this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress .
his head is chopped off and buried separately of his body ... sounds like `` the thing
that would not die ''
does not it ?
well it does play out a little like that ,
but once the body is reunited with the head ,
all the interesting and gruesome death are done
and the movie moves very slowly .
i mean
the movie is only 88 minute long
and i kept thinking
`` when is it going to end '' ?
the character in the movie are idiot for the most part
and they pretty much deserve to die
for being really stupid .
the villain is also very bad
as he is slow moving
and really you wonder
how he manages to do anything considering
he is afraid of jewelery .
the only thing
to keep you
watching after the head is reattached is the fact
that there are so many boob being flashed
that you really begin to lose track .
still i want to see a horror movie ,
not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie
it is way
to slow moving with way to many slow stretch
to be even somewhat enjoyable .
and do not read the back of the box
as it made it out
like there were flesh eating zombie attacking the town ,
there is not ... only a small scene
where three or four zombie attack a house
and are so easily repelled
they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless .
so for the most part i say
you should avoid this movie
unless you come across it for really cheap .
