`` land of plenty '' is not a film .
it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wender.many felt it in `` the million dollar hotel '' and now `` land of plenty '' makes it perfectly clear ;
not only has wender lost it ,
he is actually turned into a bad director ,
creating horribly weak and superficial story and scenes.one might argue
that the `` time you lose it '' comes for every director ,
but wender ' case is extreme .
it is as if he completely forget everything
he knew about cinema
and started all over again -
only to get sloppish results.in a few word ,
this film does not deserve your time .
