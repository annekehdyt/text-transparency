ian mcshane 
romola garia .
directed by woody allen .
just after his work with johansson on `` match point '' the two return for `` scoop '' a corky 
zany and fun comic ride .
when a student reporter
( johansson )
finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter
( mcshane )
when she enters the materializer of a lame magician
( allen ) .
the scoop being of the new tarot card killer in london
who might be preppy peter lyman
( jackman ) ;
while sondra and sid are playing detective sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer .
allen has finally hit a mark 
not as good as `` match point ''
but definitely more fun .
i laughed a lot more than i expected ,
one of the year must sees
