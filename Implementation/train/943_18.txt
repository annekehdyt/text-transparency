i did not have too much interest
in watching the flock.andrew lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affair
but he had been fired from the flock
and he had been replaced by an emergency director
called niel mueller.i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study 
so they fired him and hired another director.this usually does not work well ( let 's remember the invasion ) .but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected.it is not a great film but it is an interesting and entertaining thriller.the character development is very well done and i could know the character very well.also 
the relationship between the two main character is natural and credible.richard gere and claire dane ing competent performances.now 
let 's go to the negative points.one element
which really bothered me
( there was a moment
in which it irritated me )
was the excess of edition trick
to give the movie more `` attitude ''
and style.that trick feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.plus ,
i think
the film should have been more ambitious.in spite of that ,
i recommend the flock as a good thriller.it is not memorable at all ,
but it is entertaining .
