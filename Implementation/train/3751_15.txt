this warning against anti-semitism is well-meant
and may have had its purpose at the time ,
but it is made without the slightest notion
of how to make a film .
the director has no idea about mise-en-scene ;
the cast vary from bad till even worse.the great austrian comic han moser is wasted .
in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy ,
that is deigned as a set from das kabinett de dr. caligari ;
one wonders
whether
the maker had all their mental capabilities.the restored copy i saw
( dutch filmmuseum )
gives the impression
that some scene were not put into the right place ,
but may be the original editing was bad as well .
