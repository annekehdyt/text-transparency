when converting a book to film ,
it is generally a good idea
to keep at least some of the author 's intended tone or conveyed concept ,
rather than ignoring the author altogether .
while it is clear
that the director had access
to and went on the advice of elinore stewart 's child ,
it is key to note
that the child believed their mother to be a complete liar in regard to the good 
enriching 
strengthening experience of homesteading her land .
the book detail her life on her and her husband 's adjoining homestead in the vast wyoming frontier ;
she chronicles daily adventure with her numerous friend and acquaintance ,
though they lived dozen of mile apart .
the film 
however 
takes a standard stance for the time
it was made 
portraying this woman 's experience as harsh 
unforgiving 
and nearly pointless .
perhaps the director was inging some of his vietnam war experience with him to this movie
( as some film aficionado have said ) ,
but it seems to be a lousy excuse
for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak 
odious landscape devoid of friend or hope .
do not waste your time with this movie ;
read the book instead .
