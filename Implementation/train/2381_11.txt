i am very disappointed with `` k-911 . ''
the original `` good '' quality of `` k-9 '' does not exist any more .
this is more like a sitcom !
some of cast from original movie returned
and got some of my memory back .
the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show .
that was crazy .
what is the deal with the change of police ?
it seems like they are now lapd !
not san diego pd .
it is a completely different movie from ``
