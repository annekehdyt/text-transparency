i read the review of this movie ,
and they were generally pretty good so i thought
i should see it .
i am a big francophile and art film lover ,
but i believe
this is yet another case
in which the critic make something `` arty '' or `` intellectual '' into something
it is not .
i will be blunt :
it contains scene of sexual perverseness
that i never ,
ever wanted to actually see .
obviously 
the piano teacher has some major psychological issue ,
but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically .
the film is 
in essence 
disgusting .
i mean ,
when i saw requiem for a dream ,
i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly ,
but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust
and repulsion i felt during this film .
