this is an excellent show !
i had a us history teacher in high school
that was much like this .
there are many `` fact '' in history
that are not quite true and mr wuhl point them out very well 
in a way
that is unforgettable.mr wuhl
is teaching a class of film student but history student
and even the general public will appreciate the witty way
that he uncovers some very well known fallacy in the history of the world
and strive to impress them upon that ain of his student .
use of live actor
performing `` skit ''
is also very entertaining .
i highly recommend this series to anyone interested
in having the history
they learned
as a child turned upside down .
