i remember this movie
from when i was 12 ,
it was amazing.. i remember it to the day not like most thing i
watched back then ,
i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t !
anyway 
the acting is a bit chewy
but the story is amazing considering
it was a real b movie with a low budget
and event
the fighting scene were amazing to watch ,
i must have watched it about 20 time .
it was a very well made movie
and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robot ,
pity they had to spoil it
by making a crappy spin off `` crash and burn '' ,
do not watch that movie by the way
it is total pant !
if your a real sci-fi movie fan then watch this ,
if it was re-made today
it would be a winner.. i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it .
