i guess
if a film has magic ,
i do not need it to be fluid or seamless .
it can skip background information ,
go too fast in some place ,
too slow in other 
etc .
magic in this film :
the scene in the liary .
there are many minor flaw in stanley and iris ,
yet they do not detract from the overall positive impact of watching person help each other in area of life
that seem the most incomprehensible 
the hardest to fix .
both character are smart .
yet stanley can not understand enough to function
because he can not read ;
he can not read
because he is had too much adventure in his childhood .
iris 
although well-educated 
has not had enough adventure
and so can not understand how to move past the u-turn her life took .
in both their fault and strength 
the character compliment each other .
it may be a bit of a stretch
to accept
that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory ,
or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough
to work in construction or some other better-paying job .
and while these `` mystery '' are explained in the course of the story ,
their unfolding seems somewhat contrived .
i assume
no one took the time
to rethink the script .
even so 
it is a good movie\u0097just imagine what de niro ,
fonda and plimpton would have done on screen
if someone had !
