this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web .
so i bought me a copy .
well 
of course the acting is terrible
and the story line is childish
but it does have his moment .
i think person
who searched this one
also knows the backstory of it .
it was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget .
but for me he surely did not spoiled the money on prop
but on the make up .
the make up is for that kind of flick well done .
the zombie are watchable
and the gore is intact .
the only problem with that kind of movie is the quality of the pelicule .
it is terrible 
luckely no hiss on the sound
but sometimes it is way too dark .
so you have to watch clearly to see the gore .
in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish .
a voice-over tell in the beginning of the movie
to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flash ,
that tell you
there is gore on the way .
of course
that does not work ,
made me think of cannibal girl ,
had that annoying bell
when the red stuff started to flow .
they had the original idea ,
cannibal girl was made a year earlier .
do not go for the storyline 
go for the zombie and notice a continuity mistake .
when the girl and guy are making love first
she takes of her a ,
then they make love
and suddenly her underwear is back on ... try to do that ,
or am i getting a bit offline 
...
eat it you ugly corpse
