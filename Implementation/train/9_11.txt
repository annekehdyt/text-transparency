mr perlman gives a standout performance
( as usual ) .
sadly 
he has to struggle with an underwritten script
and some nonsensical set pieces.larsen is in `` die hard '' mode complete with singlet and bulging muscle ,
i am sure
he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.the lovely erika is very decorative
( even though fully clothed ! )
and shows some sign of `` getting '' acting at last.sfx are mainly poor cgi
and steal from other movies.the shootout are pitiful - worthy of the a-teamnot even worth seeing for perlman -
avoid
