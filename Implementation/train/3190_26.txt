`` the ex-mrs. bradford ''
( 1936 ) ,
starring thin man series star william powell
( this film was released the same year as the second thin man film 
`` after the thin man 
''
comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man film ,
but it nonetheless misses .
still 
it is a wonderfully fun ,
highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein.is myrna loy missed ?
of course 
let 's not lie .
however 
i would be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur .
and the chemistry between arthur and co-star william powell is real
and it is fun 
romantic and involving.the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne 's production company partner 
james edward grant
( `` the angel and the bad man '' )
is close to being up there with a thin man effort ,
but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.while
it is not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man '' movie
( what else is ?
) 
`` the ex-mrs. bradford '' is one of the most entertaining of the dozen and dozen of mystery-comedy `` who-done-its '' of the '30s and 40s .
