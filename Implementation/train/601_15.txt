i love this show
as it action packed with adventure 
love and intrigue .
well some time love !
it is so good see a show
where all the character work well together
and they treat each other with respect .
it is also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role
as i have only seen him in mary poppin .
the mixture of the main character 
mark 
amanda 
jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience .
this is a show
you have to watch !
