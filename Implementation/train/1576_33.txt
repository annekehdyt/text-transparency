i had some expectation for the movie ,
since it had a nice star cast
and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif .
well 
i was hesitant to watch the movie
because this was done by the same man
who wrote the story for dhoom franchise
because i hated dhoom 2 ;
but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan ,
i would say
dhoom 2 is very realistic .
when i saw the credit at the beginning ,
i felt nice
because it was put up in a nice way .
well 
the very first scene itself pis*ed me off .
then 
the major drawback of the movie is the action sequence .
me and my friend were laughing our gut off watching this crappy fight .
it was like akshay against some 30 thug and all and the thug even got machine guns !
phew ... you got to see this
to understand
how bad the action sequence are.the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story .
it reminded me of some of the early 80 's movies.well 
the only thing
the movie is worth
is of sexy kareena ,
who looked really hot in this one.and for that ,
i give a rating of 2/10.guys ,
please..please ... do not see this one thinking
that it is a real gangster movie .
well 
you can watch this to have some laugh at the terrible fight scenes.that all .
