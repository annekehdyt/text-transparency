this is a direct sequel to 'the mummy 's hand '
( 1940 ) ,
because the lead character 
stephen banning
( played by dick foran )
is now thirty year older
and is relating the story
( with the help of archival footage )
to his son 's fianc\u00e9 .
there are only two unusual aspect to the film :
the early death of banning 
and the presence of turhan bey.lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing ,
though given the nature of his role ,
he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arm about .
there is nothing scary about his presence 
except for his attempt to carry off the fianc\u00e9 
isobel
( elyse knox ) .
dick foran gets second billing ,
but he is killed off within the first fifteen minute !
we 'd have to wait until 'psycho '
( 1960 )
when a lead character
( janet leigh )
dies way before the end of the movie !
banning 's buddy from the first film 
babe jenson
( now henson ) ,
shows up a little later
looking much 
much ,
older and not doing any of the comic shtick
he did in the original .
it is hard to believe
it is the same actor !
unfortunately 
this great acting job is wasted
because he gets killed by kharis after only two ief scene .
it is then left up to banning 's son john
( played by bit player john hubbard )
to led the chase to the cemetery
-- no !
the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob
to banning 's house
to burn it down
and kill the mummy .
sound universally familiar ?
turhan bey is introduced to audience as the new high priest 
mehmet bey 
to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis .
with his 'exotic ' voice and appearance 
it is too bad
he gets so easily killed .
a better movie would have had 'babe ' take von helsing type charge of thing in tracking down the mummy 
with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay .
but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set piece from previous universal horror film ,
put together by the hack griffin jay
who wrote many of universal 's other clunker ,
although he also did 'don winslow of the navy '
( 1942 )
as well as 'don winslow of the coast guard '
( 1943 )
which also featured elyse knox.elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movie
( 1946-1949 ) ,
and of course 
turhan bey 
with 43 movie and tv credit 
is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr. x '
( 1948 )
.the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric
( with lot of noirish shadow in the sheriff 's office )
than the first 'kharis ' mummy film ,
but there is little else of interest or excitement.i will give it a 3 .
