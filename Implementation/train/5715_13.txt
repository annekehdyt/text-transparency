this movie should not be compared to `` the sting '' 
or other caper/heist/con game film .
what makes it such a great movie experience
is what it has to say about relationship 
deceit and trust .
it is also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry ,
given
that the female protagonist is a shrink
who is so easily deceived
and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale .
has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy ?
highly 
hugely recommended !
