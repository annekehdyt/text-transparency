at least the seat in the theater were comfortable
and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible
to drown out the inferior dialogue .
this is absolutely not a girl film .
any bloke
who like it ,
are the one us lady can be sure to stay far away from .
dumb story 
mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film .
i have seen many ,
many movie but this one is the new winner in the bad category .
if you do happen to see it ,
the one thing you will look forward to is the ending .
so you can finally run out of the theater as fast
as you can .
