before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scene in the film ,
but listening was not doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow !
ned beatty 
ronny cox 
jon voight and burt reynold make for an interesting group of individual
who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of event
that transpires upon them all .
the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person ,
but eventually you know
these guy like they were your friend .
the acting 
dialogue is very very real ,
as close to reality
as you can get for hollywood acting .
reynold character `` lewis '' was interesting as a guy
who comes off very tough
but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and oken man
( i was impressed with his performance ! )
jon voight seems to be the character
that on the spotlight the most 
the unfortunate circumstance
that seem to find him at every corner really mold
and caste him into a different man at the end
( his character transition was excellent ) .
ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads
that just like to joke around
and do not seem to get too awful serious
unless they have too ,
and they did ...
i really was amazed at director boorman 's vision of dickey 's novel 
very impressed .
you can not go your whole life
without watching this film .
i give it eight out of ten star 
extremely impressed .
