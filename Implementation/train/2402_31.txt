i have read some terrible thing about this film ,
so i was prepared for the worst .
`` confusing .
muddled .
horribly structured . ''
while there may be merit to some of these accusation ,
this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer .
in fact 
it actually had aspiration .
it attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense .
and by god 
there are some interesting thing going on.ms .
barbeau is a miracle to behold .
she carries
the film squarely on her shoulders.this is not to say
that it is a masterpiece .
unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition .
there are just too many
( unexplained )
subplot trying to coexist .
and the plot loophole
created by time travel
are never really addressed : for example ,
if hope knows
that her mother is evil
and that she will ultimately kill her other ,
then why does not she just kill ma in the film 's very first sequence ?
seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future
to do it.still ,
i give unholy point for trying .
a little ambition is not a bad thing .
