even if you could get past the idea
that these boring character personally witnessed every significan not moment of the 1960
( ok ,
so katie did not join the manson family ,
and nobody died at altamont ) ,
this movie was still unbelievably awful .
i got the impression
that the `` writer '' just locked themselves in a room
and watched `` forrest gump 
'' `` the wonder year 
'' and oliver stone 's 60s film over and over again
and called it research .
a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode `` head spinning '' .
he was right .
