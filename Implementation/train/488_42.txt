a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his
that had been optioned by a movie studio .
to say
it was one of the most inept and insipid script i would ever read
would be a bold understatement .
yet i never told him this .
why ?
because in a world where film like `` while she was out ''
can be green-lighted
and attract an oscar- winning star like kim basinger 
a screenplay lacking in character 
content and common sense is no guarantee
that it will not sell.as so many other reviewer
have pointed out ,
`` while she was out ''
is a dreadfully under-written woman-in-peril film
that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hood on christmas eve .
every gripe is legitimate 
from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapse of logic ,
but basinger is such an interesting actress
and the premise is not without promise .
here are a couple of thing
that struck me:1 )
i do not care how much we are supposed to think
her husband is a jerk ,
the house is a mess with toy .
since when did it become child abuse
to make kid pick up after themselves ? 2 )
racially diverse gang are rare everywhere except hollywood ,
where they are usually the only racially balanced group on screen.3 )
sure the film is stupid .
but so are the countless `` thriller '' i have sat through where the woman are portrayed as wailing 
helpless victim of male sadism .
stupid or not 
i found
it refreshing to see a woman
getting the best of her tormentors.4 )
i loved the ending !
5 )
though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase ,
i really do think
this film should be retitled `` the red toolbox of doom . ''
