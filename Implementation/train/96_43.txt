`` a young woman suffer from the delusion
that she is a werewolf ,
based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one .
due to her past treatmant by man ,
she travels the countryside seducing
and killing the man she meet .
falling in love with a kind man ,
her life appears to take a turn for the better
when she is raped
and her lover is killed by a band of thug .
traumatized again by these latest event ,
the woman returns to her violent way
and seeks revenge on the thug 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.rino di silvestro 's `` la lupa mannara '' begins with full frontal 
writhing 
moaning dance by shapely blonde annik borel ,
who
( as daniella neseri )
mistakenly believes
she is a werewolf .
the hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her leg .
the opening `` flashback '' reveals her hairy ancestor was ( probably )
a lycan nothropic creature .
ms. borel is 
unfortunately 
not a werewolf ;
she is merely a very strong lunatic.as a film ,
`` werewolf woman ''
( in english )
would have been better
if borel 's character really was a female werewolf ;
with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization .
but ,
as far as 1970s skin and blood flick go ,
this one is hard to beat .
bouncy borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film ,
which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore .
dazzling dagmar lassander
( as elena )
and hunky howard ross
( as luca )
are good supporting player .
