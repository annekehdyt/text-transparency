wow .
i do not even really remember that much about this movie ,
except that it stunk.the plot 's basically ;
a girl 's parent neglect her 
so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad .
am i the only one disturbed by that ?
then 
this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ash 's mom to pretend to be the girl 's .
i do not care
if he was trying to make the girl happy ,
that is just gross.there was no real plot .
the girl was just a whiny at
who wanted thing her own way .
she played with unown ,
was the `` daughter '' of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her `` dad '' .that is pretty much all i can remember ,
but i think
you can take it as a hint ,
and not see it .
( or if you do see it ,
do not expect much . )
1/10.seriously .
if you want a pokemon movie ,
rent `` pokemon ;
the first movie '' .
