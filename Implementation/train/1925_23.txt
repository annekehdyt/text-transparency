tenant two writer struggle to complete their book in an all but empty apartment house .
they at first help each other
and then slowly the tension between them begins to build.this is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks
as though they are in that novel .
very little of the dialog is natural 
its purple and imming with shade of meaning .
its as if a college english major with a head full of pretension wrote the script .
it is awful
and i found myself instantly immune
to anything the film
had to say ,
which is a shame
since the film is populated with great performance from top to bottom .
snoop dog on down are fine form ,
unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the word
and the premise.i can not really recommend this movie .
while not really bad 
its very preachy and pretentious to the point
of making you want to walk away .
i lost interest less then a third of the way
in and had to struggle to get to the end .
if you are interested i would try it on cable ,
but i would not lay out good money to see it .
