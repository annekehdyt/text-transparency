i grew up watching inspector gadget .
it was ,
and still is 
one of my favorite cartoon 
if not my absolute favorite .
i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off inspector gadget 's field trip .
i wanted to slip on a banana peel
and become the greatest detective ever.but
the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.matthew broderick 
an actor with potential ,
was definitely not the role for inspector gadget .
first thing- in the film ,
inspector gadget is smart .
not so in the cartoon .
in the film 
gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself .
in the cartoon 
it was almost always penny 
brain 
and the awesome book
( i still want her book ! ) .
if gadget solved the mystery ,
it was by accident .
gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective ,
but in the cartoon was pretty dumb ,
which was where the humor came from.another thing
is that it is too much `` good guy v. bad guy '' in the film .
it is not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon .
also 
gadget never should have a love story ,
but disney corporation is filled with idiots.also i miss the true gadget
that gadget had 
and especially the gadget car .
in the movie it was a chic convertible .
in the cartoon it was a sedan police car
and could turn into a van .
it also barely had any gadget
and was mainly there to get him from place to place.but if anything ,
the one thing
that was terrible about the movie
was
that it was a feature movie .
inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon .
the movie was too serious 
too overdone ,
had too much of a plot
and was not even remotely as funny.tip for those
who have not seen it :
never see it .
ever .
watch the cartoon ,
it is a true classic .
