serum starts as eddie
( derek phillip )
is delighted to learn
he has been accepted into medical school
to carry on the family tradition
of becoming an md like his father richard
( dennis o'neill )
and his uncle eddie
( david h. hickey ) ,
however his joy could be short lived
as eddie is involved in an accident
and is run over by a car .
taken to the nearest hospital
it does not look good for poor eddie
so his uncle eddie convince his other richard to let him save eddie with the serum
he has developed 
a serum
which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness .
desperate for his boy to live richard agree
but the procedure has unwanted side effect
like turning eddie into a ain eating zombie
which is just not a good thing ... executive
produced ,
written and directed by steve franke i will be perfectly frank myself
and say
serum is awful ,
serum is one of those no budget horror film
which tries to rip-off other any number of other 's and ends up being slightly more fun
than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers .
the script is terrible ,
it has the whole re-animator
( 1985 )
feel to it with mad scientist wielding huge syringe trying to eradicate death
but it is so boring it is untrue ,
the first forty minute is nothing more than a really dull soap opera
that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home
after spending some time away
and finding his ex-girlfriend has hooked up with someone else ,
argument with his step-mom 
getting drunk with his mate
and generally boring the audience stiff .
so 
once the tedium of the first forty minute is over
and if your still watching
it it takes another twenty minute
to get eddie re-animated
and then he kills a couple of person ,
polouse catch up with him and shoot him 
the end .
thank god .
serum is devoid of any of the characteristic 's
that one would associate with a good film ,
the character 's suck 
the dialogue is poor ,
it takes itself far too seriously ,
it is dull ,
it is slow ,
it is forgettable
and considering
it is meant to be a horror film
there is an alarming lack of blood 
gore or horror .
not recommended ,
did i mention serum was boring ?
i thought
so.director franke does nothing to liven this thing up ,
although competent there is no style here at all .
the gore level are none existent ,
there is a bit of splashed blood 
a bitten neck 
a couple of scar on a dead woman 's face 
a couple of scene
where a needle pierce skin
and that is it .
do not expect a re-animator in the gore department
because
if you do your going
to be sorely disappointed ,
much like i was in fact .
filmed in what look like one house ,
one restaurant and a lab the film has no variety
either and just look cheap throughout .
there is a couple of scene of nudity
but that is nowhere near enough
to save it.technically the film is not too bad ,
at least it look like proper camera were used ,
i can not really comment on the special effect
because there are not any
but generally speaking serum look reasonably professional .
apparently shot in texas 
or should
that read
it should have
literally been shot in texas ?
the acting suck although again i think
they were proper actor 's rather than friend or family of the director.serum is a terrible film ,
it is dull 
slow 
boring 
has no gore
and feel like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minute .
i do not understand
why anyone would feel the need to watch this
when they can watch re-animator or one of it is sequel again instead ,
seriously i recommend you give serum a miss .
there i have just saved you from wasting 90 minute of your life ,
you can thank me later .
