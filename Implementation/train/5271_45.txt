i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film .
i am a man nearly 50
who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film .
this happened quite by accident 
with the discovery of a movie
called clerk late one night on television .
the first two thing i noticed
about that film were that
it was 1 )
technically amateurish and 2 )
illiantly written .
when i read an interview with the director in the local paper
and he said
that one of his influence was clerk ,
i started to get interesting .
when he said
his main influence was the station agent ,
a movie i would seen on dvd a week prior ,
i decided i had to go
and check it out .
the result could be described along the same line as clerk ,
although the two film are nothing alike content wise .
both film suffer from technical gaffes
that are overcome through amazing writing .
wherea clerk is a day in the life of a man
who has nothing in his life at all
and is afraid to ask tough question about himself and his situation ,
less like me is about a man
who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy ,
he is always running one way or another ,
filling his life with little thing so
that he will never have to deal with the big one .
the theme and idea of this film are strong and poignant .
i can tell from watching it
that not much has changed
since i was growing up ,
young man still have the same problem
they always have .
the writer dresses up these problem and theme in the modern vernacular 
craft wonderfully honet character ,
and has them do completely believable thing .
as far as indie cinema goes ,
this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint ,
but from an artistic one 
it is very close .
