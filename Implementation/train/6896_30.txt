this is almost typical lynch .
however 
what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact
that it looks very raw 
almost amateurish .
but i believe
lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism ,
which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments.however ,
a lot of typical lynch motif are present 
such as :
floating camera work ; haunting music ; long
( excruciating ) pauses ; hanging curtain ; dim light growing darker at a slow
( almost indiscernible )
pace ;
extreme close up ;
theme of woman in trouble ; over-bearing 
incompassionate ,
all knowing character
facing off with character
who are distraught ,
temporarily oblivious 
in the dark and so on ... the performance are great
and the short is thought provoking .
as usual 
lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation .
many question are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.another illiant effort from lynch .
i only hope
he makes some short 
more along the line of his sony playstation 2 commercial .
they were inspired .
