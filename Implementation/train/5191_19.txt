i was babysitting a family of three small child for a night
and their mother gave me this
to show
for them having just grabbed it at wal-mart earlier in the week .
all three child actually got physically ill
while watching it .
i am pretty sure
it was the pizza they ate 
or something
they all had picked up from school ,
but really it could have been this film .
absolutely disgusting .
how any one can produce this caliber of trash
is beyond me .
fortunately 
i turned off the film
when i noticed the child were not responding and acting strangely .
for any parent out there ,
i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young child view this movie .
