belushi at his most ingratiating and courtney cox before friend has a small role .
i often think
belushi is under-used in hollywood
and this film role is one of his best .
for those of you
who watch his tv show ,
this is a very different and likable character .
the movie itself is not earth shattering ,
nor is the message new
but rather it is sweet and endearing .
the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar name is a perfect balance
although lovitz 's whining can get tiresome ,
and michael caine 's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well-meaning edge .
hamilton 
as belushi 's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonder
why he married her .
in addition 
renee russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the `` prom queen ''
who got away .
nevertheless 
a nice way
to spend two hour .
