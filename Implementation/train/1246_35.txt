the story is seen before ,
but that does'n matter
if you can figure out
to make a proper storyboard .
it is clear that the director have not spent his work on the storyboard .
alongside this 
the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angle
that do not match the message of the movie .
the funniest is 
however ,
if you take a look at the movie 's website ,
you can read
that it was on purpose
that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angle .
because it remind us about hunting .
but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angle ;
- )
it will have 1 star
because the story is ok.
it is a pity
that ti west 
has not spent more time to review his story .
it is as if
the movie was more important than the planning .
because you have a camera does
not mean you should make a movie right away ... come .
everyone can make a movie ,
but not all will be just as good .
so a word of advice to ti west are :
stop and labeling what you want .
use your time
to start planning and not filming
until everything has come down on a storyboard .
you certainly have the ability and desire -
so do not abuse your talent .
