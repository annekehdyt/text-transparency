when i first popped in happy birthday to me ,
i checked the timer
to see how long the film was .
i was amazed at the length .
both animated and horror film share a common ground :
attention span of the selected audience
and that should be at or right around 90 minute .
anything more ,
and you will lose the bulk of your audience.this 110 minute ,
or 20 minute past its prime was a huge problem for me .
i would like to say
half of this movie could have been edited out ,
but i would be too generous to say that .
go ahead
and watch it
and tell me
how many scene could have been edited ,
even without being a film major.regardless of the overstayed visit ,
the movie was below mediocre .
it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery
on which of the `` elite 10 '' is killing off the remaining friend .
for the most part 
they not only over-do it ,
but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say
`` it is this guy !
no !
it is this gal ! ''
you will spend more time with the camera misleading you
than actually enjoying the movie .
and do not get me started on the acting.okay ,
that got me started .
i had to laugh in the beginning
trying to remember
if melissa sue anderson played the character
that went blind on little house on the prairie
( later ,
research proved my suspicion correct )
because all the way through this movie ,
she genuinely looked blind .
strange 
as an established actress 
she should have been the best of the group ,
but turned out the worst .
the rest of the staff 
aside from ann
( bregman )
was pretty damn bad 
too ,
but she 
uh 
took the cake.the movie begins with a group of ten friend ,
and one 's immediately killed off .
barely anyone thinks twice of this `` dear '' friend 's disappearance ,
so they continue on their merry way .
slowly 
then more rapidly 
there are revelation about virginia 's
( anderson ) ,
the main character 
past and her psychologist ,
who 's a tad bit more personal
( and on call 24/7 
apparently )
than most shrink .
all the while 
more and more death occur.what is funny is 
just as the first `` disappearance 
'' the more `` best buds '' vanish 
the less the rest care .
sure 
they give a few second of air time
to say `` wow ,
( that person )
just would not run off '' etc ,
but then they are back to their sexual way .
and speaking of which 
it is probably due to the horrid script ,
or maybe it was i
who was losing interest at minute 30 ,
but it was really hard to keep up with who liked
who of the group
as they all seemed to be sexual partner of the next or someone
would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friend the next scene .
see :
the creepy guy
that kept a mouse/rat in his pocket \u0096 literally \u0096
and was the most obvious suspect .
i am giving the film too much credit
( and time 
)
but how he became part of the `` elite 10 '' i will never know.but 
i digress ,
there is a mystery here .
why are these kid target ?
why is virginia thinking
she is killed someone ,
when it was never proved
( 'till the end )
that any of them actually has been slaughtered ?
and why would the trailer and poster claim these
killing to be `` six of the most bizarre murder
you will ever see '' ?
hell 
even for 1981 
most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the 13th film \u0096 coincidentally enough ,
friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 week to the day of happy birthday to me .
perhaps 
they are speaking
of when they filmed it month prior ,
but were late to the 
well ,
party.when the `` secret '' are revealed ,
trust me 
you will have to rewind 3-4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motive 
and even then 
put the subtitle on to get all the mumbling victim/killer 's word .
even if you get the first time ,
it is an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale .
it is almost worth watching the whole movie again ,
but as a drinking game.this birthday gathering should be avoided .
it is a horrible and illogical first draft script \u0096 please ,
please know
it takes multiple rewrite before the cameras role ,
it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting
and it is 100 % unrealistic on how person react in extraordinary circumstances.side note :
when i was a kid 
or say 10-11 year old 
i loved horror film .
( still do 
oddly .
definite guilty pleasure ,
but they are getting harder and harder to watch as year pass . )
we got our first vcr ,
and i taped as many horror film off network
( or 
edited version )
tv .
all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last 10 minute on tape ,
which scared me to death \u0096
and obviously gave away the big mystery
on who the killer was .
even though i have seen other clip of this movie ,
i think
this is the first full-length
viewing i have had .
thankfully 
this awful movie did not wound me as a child .
i am older now ,
and i can take this trash .
but never again.side note 2 :
that said ,
that crazy `` happy birthday to me '' song
played in the end credit
( and as a score throughout )
still creeps me out tremendously .
i guess 
this movie
( or last few minute 
)
did have an influence on my childhood .
shame on you 
melissa sue anderson !
