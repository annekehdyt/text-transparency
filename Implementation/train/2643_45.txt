i get the feeling
that the producer of this mess were out
to make the most painful ,
ridiculous western ever made .
`` painful '' is the best word i can think
of to describe it.on the plus side
you have nice color photography and beautiful and well-spoken rhonda fleming .
my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon
( who played the cripple ) ,
who acted well enough in an annoying role ,
written so atrociously
that no actor could give an enjoyable performance .
the production value were quite good ,
which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay.thing i hated :
stewart granger looked so little like a western figure 
what with his british accent 
neat tailored outfit 
and silly immaculate always-white kerchief tied around his neck .
it got tiresome the way
the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger ,
and he never spoke up or replied back .
i know
we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate western as symbolic morality play ,
but this one oke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scene 
the worst being at the end
where granger miraculously 
speedily and single-handedly plant dynamite around a canyon pass
that the bad guy 's cattle will pass through ,
and then granger plant himself in the perfect spot
so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance
to create rock slide to bury and spook the cattle and bad guy ,
seemingly destroying them all ,
save the two main bad guy .
next worst is everything about the plot ,
which is loaded with soap opera scene .
nothing in the movie seemed believable :
i could not believe
what all the conflict was about .
the bad guy was driving his herd through to market
and wanted the cow
to chew some grass along the way ;
i do not see
why something could not have been worked out .
you need a land ownership dispute for that ?
do not bother to see it .
