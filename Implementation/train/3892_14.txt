i had read an article about dan jansen 's olympic and personal journey
before seeing this movie .
i am always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering event ,
and this was no exception.the background of the character
that is provided gives you a sense of the family 's closeness
and how they positively affected each other ' life .
i can not speak to the accuracy of specific detail in this movie ,
it is customary to take some creative license
when organizing a script .
however 
the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here.its a worthwhile movie of a story
that should be told .
i felt empathy for the character
and cheered at the end .
