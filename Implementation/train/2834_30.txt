this movie is awesome on so many level ...
and none of them are the level
that it was intended to be awesome on.just remember this :
when you are watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movie ...
be they good or bad ...
this is the formula
that they are using .
this is what makes zombie movie
so great.and what makes it better
than great is the story behind the movie .
a simple web search will provide you with everything you
need to know.all in all ,
it does not linger .
there is never a point
where you think to yourself `` c'mon ,
get on with it '' ...
it moves quick and corner nicely .
this is the sporty 
little italian number of zombie flicks.so awful ,
it is wonderful !
if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek ... rent it ,
buy it ,
love it.as a great trivia note :
if you are watching it on dvd ,
you will notice
that there is sound effect during the menu screen 
underneath the musical score ... well ...
that is because that music was lifted straight from the trailer ...
which is probably the only working print of that music
that still exists which is long enough to loop .
