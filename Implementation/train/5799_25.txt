i used to love watching this .
i had no idea
it was part of a larger series .
i must have been 6 or so at the time
it was on tv .
i just thought
it was funny
and for some reason i had a deep fascination for something
that was clear
that was in the president 's pile of bathtub toy .
my parent had taped this off of tv
when it originally aired on nbc .
the tape even had the old sanka coffee commercial
along with a few other .
i am planning on returning home sometime soon
and will try to record the tape onto my computer so
that those
who want a copy
can do so .
if anyone of you would like to contact me ,
i think
you can do that through the imdb site feel free .
i will keep you updated
and let you know
when i have the show in a digital format .
