boring stuff we got here .
his 5 minute short are better than this .
know why ?
because there only 5 minute and not 91 minute
or how ever long this is .
the plot is kinda ...
eh.. the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny =
( i had my hope up ,
the trailer made it look funny
but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny .
just plain boring klayman running into each other
and trying to make us laugh.. not working.maybe next time knox.maybe re-cutting this movie
and adding better scene would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good .
