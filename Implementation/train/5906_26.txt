the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise
and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of hollywood screwball romance/comedy.i usually do not go for those type of film
and that tiresome storyline
but this one was refreshing 
fun to watch ,
and oozes with charm.jimmy stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other well
and make a very handsome couple .
the supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable felix bressart to the villain joseph schildkraut .
frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting character
i
have ever seen him do in his career .
he takes the film
and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile
when something dramatic happen to him .
that `` twist '' is another reason this film rises above other of its kind.once again ,
when a film has a good mix of category ,
it usually succeeds .
this is a great example of that .
in this movie 
it is romance 
comedy and drama
and it is well done .
i will take this over the re-make
`` you have got mail 
'' any day .
no comparison .
