word can not begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is .
i wish
it were `` so bad it is good 
''
but it is not .
it is just dull 
lifeless 
and boring .
it is so bad i could not even laugh at it.in response to other poster ,
anne-marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie .
the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly ,
who as a true statement on vanity ,
cast himself as the male lead .
they both look like ineed 
sister and other.the gal 
sherry thurig ,
is a looker .
the complete opposite of anne-marie - attractive .
this girl is tall and willowy ,
and can act .
although you can tell
she is holding back.all the actor seem to be holding back 
especially the supporting male 
mark .
i have seen less wood in a rain forest ,
but he is still better than kelly .
why would kelly keep his actor from acting ?
is he really that bad a director ?
everyone else has summed the story up perfectly -
there is not one .
kid are kidnapped and kelly step in poo
to solve the crime .
i know
how he felt stepping in the poo ,
it is how i felt
after watching his movie.yes ,
i tried to get my money back from the rental store .
this is a home movie best left
to be seen by the friend of the director
(
and if you search them out ,
you will see those same friend were the one
who gave the movie positive mark ) .
