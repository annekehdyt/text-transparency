please note
that i have not seen the film
since i discovered it in 2007 ,
and my town is smaller
and does not carry it .
however 
i really want to say something about it .
i am actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke
and would like to point out
that the person
they based the main character on
was in reality completely different ! ! !
hollywood 's idea of person and artistic license granted 
the real dr. bucke totally endorsed hysterectomy to cure insanity in woman ,
and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film .
i think
it is laughable to see various film critic
who write for legitimate newspaper
who say
this film has some historical basis !
the only actual
fact i can see
is the friendship between dr. bucke and walt whitman .
please do not waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror
that real woman experienced at the hand of this doctor
who has now been glorified by the film industry .
