this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire ,
well told and provoking we see the inner working of a world now gone ,
and learn about the person
who lived there.i
enjoyed the story 
character 
acting and scene .
a few scene suffered from quick editing and the sub title sometimes disappeared too quickly ,
otherwise a wonderful piece.the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain
who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job
without over doing it .
the scene with her and alex descas
( nadir )
are charming and lovely.i recommend this film for anybody
looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world
they are emulating .
