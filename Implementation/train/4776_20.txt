the story idea is excellent .
unfortunately 
the execution lets it down.the movie lacks pace 
for one thing .
it should be an exciting ride ,
but it is slow and more than a little boring.i think
the problem 's mainly in the screenplay and editing .
there are not enough obstacle and reversal to ratchet up suspense ,
and there are scene
which do not really move the story along very effectively.the producer should have seen this in the screenplay
and insisted upon a major rewrite .
unfortunately ,
when the producer is also the writer and the director ,
this evidently are not gon na happen.much of the acting seems kind of flat ,
and that is down to the director -
all the actor have been quite competent in other projects.it
is a shame ,
because with better writing 
editing and direction ,
this could have been a really good thriller .
