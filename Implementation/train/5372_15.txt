as i am always looking for something new and unique ,
i watched this film online .
i thought
that it would be just another `` b '' rate movie
but i was amazed at the acting by the two main character .
all of the actor in this film were very capable and well directed .
the plot was wonderful
and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp 
`` dumb and dumber '' or blood and gut .
this is a wonderfully poignant film
showing some grim reality of life
coupled with the kindness of the human heart
and just enough frivolity
to keep it interesting.i would prefer this movie to many `` a '' rate movie i
have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.i highly recommend this movie .
