i watched this movie with some curiosity .
i wanted to see if 1 )
paul muni could play chinese and 2 )
luise rainer deserved her oscar .
i came away from the film
thinking yes !
having seen muni in only one film
where he was quite hammy ,
i expected the same type of performance here .
i was happily proved wrong .
although some might criticize him
as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the hollywood idea of asian ,
i thought
he was just right in the role .
keye luke ,
if he had been given the chance
to play a lead role ,
might have played him in much
the same manner.i was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scene 
especially during the sacking of the palace where o-lan was once a slave .
the graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike other of the same time
where it was all glitz and glitter .
i watched this film from beginning to end enthralled .
i can not say the same for the `` epic '' of today .
