have you heard the story about the reluctant hero
who were hired by a king to slay a dragon ?
oh 
you have ?
was it set in a world entirely composed of small island floating above cloud ,
and did the hero have to make dangerous leap from one island to the next on their journey ?
did water flow upward and remnant of great city levitate on the horizon ?
i did not think
so.i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i am really glad
that i did !
it is one of the most beautiful movie i
have ever seen .
much like the pixar movie 
it is a piece of computer animated art
that could only be possible in today 's world .
the animator have invested thought into almost everything
that appears on the screen ,
and this attention to detail is staggering
( the scene
where the mushroom in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the character walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourite ) .
the monster are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action.although the plot may not be entirely unique ,
the movie has enough charm
to make sure
you keep watching .
our protagonist are likable and interesting ,
ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest
to reach the end of the world
and destroy the dragon
which might otherwise devour everything in its path .
of course 
hector is the character
most will fall in love with .
a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency
to speak a mixture of nonsense and english 
hector provides comedy relief in a way
jar jar bink could only dream of.in summary ,
i would recommend watching the dragon hunter
if you get the opportunity .
watch it for the incredible animation 
the eath-taking battle scene and for a glimpse into a world
that is unlike anything else
you have seen on a cinema or television screen .
at the very least 
it is a fun way
to spend an hour and a half - no matter
if you are nine or twenty-nine
( which ,
in fact 
i am ) !
