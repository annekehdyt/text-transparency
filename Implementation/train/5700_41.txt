schlocky '70s horror film ... ya got ta love 'em .
in contrast to today 's boring slasher flick 
these k-tel special actually do something scary
and do not resort to a tired formula.this is a b movie about the making of a b movie ...
that went horribly wrong .
faith domergue
( this island earth )
stars as an over-the-hill 
b movie queen
making a movie about a series of grisly murder
that befell a family in their home .
her boyfriend/director ,
who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude ,
is filming on location and on a tight schedule .
the ken doll co-star discovers a book of tibetian chant
that they work into the script
to add `` realism '' .
unfortunately 
`` realism '' is something
they could have done without.john carradine ,
having long since given up looking for the 17th gland
( the unearthly ) ,
now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate .
he goes about his daily work ,
but always seems to run afoul of the director.the horror builds slowly ;
a dead cat here 
john carradine
entering a grave there ,
finally culminating in seven 
yes seven murder .
( at least there is truth in advertising . )
it is just sad that the ghoul did not understand
that there was a movie
being made above him .
how was poor faith to know
that those darn tibetian chant would actually work ?
face it 
you just can not go around tugging on satan 's coat
and expect him to take it lying
down.sterno says
perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpse .
