i came at this film with high expectation .
i was aware of greenaway 's work and 'the tempest '
and was interested in an adaptation .
i first wanted to switch off after ten minute ,
but felt
that it would be unfair .
there was a representation of a storm ,
but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat ?
it is symbolic of what ?
i continued another ten minute my finger twitching over the 'off ' button ,
somewhere something would capture my interest .
this is not shakespeare ,
it is not cinema .
there is a time and place for it ,
but i will not waste my time
and there is no place for it in my study of shakespeare .
after twenty five minute i gave up
and that was the end .
i then read all the comment on this website
and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendant .
'its a painting ... ..then put it in a gallery ' ,
'it is a ballet ... ..keep it on the stage then ' .
shakespeare can be done intelligently ,
and the play were performed
to mass audience ,
they were accessible ,
and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large - and i do not think
that the bard would be happy with that .
