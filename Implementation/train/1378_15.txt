this film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio-terrorism 
and the threat of superbug 
west nile virus 
and sar .
as a thriller 
the tension is fairly intense .
richard widmark and paul dougla are more than serviceable in their role .
the domestic scene between widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot .
the actor in this film
who most left his mark
is jack palance .
his sharply defined feature and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface .
the chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today .
recommended 
7/10 .
