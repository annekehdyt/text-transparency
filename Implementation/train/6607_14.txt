a simple comment ... what can i say
... this is a wonderful film
that i can watch over and over .
it is definitely one of the top ten comedy made .
with a great cast 
jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon ,
based on his play.it is real to life situation done perfectly .
if you have digital cable ,
one gets the menu on bottom of screen
to give what is on .
it usually gives this film *** % star but in reality it deserves **** star .
if you really watch this film ,
one can tell
that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred year from now .
