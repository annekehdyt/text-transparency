wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe
that i started awake so late
to watch it
but it came on late ounce i started watching i could not stop it had a full range of very good cast member wow even eartha kitt and ruby dee forrest whittaker and jame earl jone and many more well
known actor and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history
it was eye opening into another part of society
that person do not know
of and may even be embarrassed to talk about .
i have never heard of a book or movie about this
before and this is something
that black history never addresses only looks down
on because they were privleged and mixed race ,
i highly recommend this movie
