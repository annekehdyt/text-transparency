this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movie i
have ever seen .
it shows a china i had never seen or imagined ,
and i believe
it shows 1930 's china in the most real light ever
seen in a movie .
it is absolutely heart-eaking in so many situation ,
seeing
how hard life was for the character ,
and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful .
you truly see the depth and heigth of human existence in this film .
the actor are all perfect ,
such that you feel
like you have really entered a different world .
i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough .
it may just change you forever once you have seen it .
