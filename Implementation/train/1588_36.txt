well 
the big money machine has done
it again !
disney very shrewdly takes advantage of moron like myself
who feel
we must own every video
( good or bad )
stamped with the disney moniker .
why is it that i continue to look forward to these `` sequel ''
which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci ?
cinderella 2 consist of three storyline
( already a poor choice ! )
does not one of the most endearing disney creation at least deserve a linear story ?
of these three 
only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling
that i would expect .
the music is atrocious and modern
( meaning in 2 year it will already be dated )
and adds nothing to the story .
why does everything have to be updated ?
you know ,
the original cartoon is still popular
because of its timelessness ,
so why not be respectful and true to the original with song
that reflect the same style ?
gee 
i can not wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty .
instead of music
based on the theme of tchaikovsky ,
we will get music inspired by britney spear ! ! !
so disney ,
if you are listening ,
remember we are not all indiscriminate child out here .
how about throwing a bone or two to the fan
who 've been around long enough
to know the difference between craft and crap ?
