dear me ... peter seller was one of the most oddly talented actor
there has been .
but his choice of film 
say 
after 1964 
was very unfortunate .
he did not seem to realize how to use his talent .
he would have been better off working with more of the kuick of the film world than the person
he did .
of his later film 
only `` the optimist of nine elm ''
and `` being there ''
have impressed me of those i have seen.that said ,
the boulting and seller had made a few film prior to this
that hardly sound
that bad - i have yet to see `` carlton browne '' and `` heaven above ! ''
- at least in the sense of using seller well to a degree .
but ,
`` there is a girl in my soup ''
really is a poor film and a dire choice on seller ' part in term of character .
in his film from 1955-64 
you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist
and always an enigmatic conviction in his role .
here 
you have peter seller trying to play a typical romantic lead .
it is almost seller playing a niven cad
without the joviality .
he certainly does not convince ,
try as he might ,
or create an interesting character .
he should have left such part to master of suavity such as cary grant ,
and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic role
that he was famed for.hawn
and seller really do not establish any genuine chemistry ;
this is no easy 
genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy .
it is very artificial seeming ,
all the way
through - i know
that it is part of danver ' character
that he is a dry procurer of lady ,
but he does not really change from that in a way
that convince .
seller has a very grating way
of playing `` charm '' as well ... this character really has no depth ,
and really does not gain the viewer 's sympathy or interest .
seller goes through the motion in a way
one would not think possible
when remembering the magnificence of his shifty 
iconoclastic performance in `` lolita '' .there really is nothing to say about the plot 
direction or character ,
as frankly they leave little or no impression .
this is truly one of the most anaemic 
complacent 
misguided and lightly dull film i have ever seen .
a nonentity of a `` vehicle '' for seller ' undisputed talent.rating :
- * 1/2/*****
