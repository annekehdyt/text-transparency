why did not the producer give
that show a chance of all the junk on tv ,
why did not the producer give six degree a chance ?
will the series go on video ?
i would love to see how it ends .
put season one on video
and sell it .
i was a loyal fan of six degree
and waited for it is return .
i set my recorder to tape all of the show .
thank god for that .
i just found out
that the show was canceled and i am heart oken .
i wish i knew
it was going to be canceled ,
why did not they tell us ?
i thought
the show was just developing some depth in the character .
the writing was pretty good also .
steven
( campbell scott )
is my all time favorite .
i am so sorry to see it go !
