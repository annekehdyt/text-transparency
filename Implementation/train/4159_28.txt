this movie is visually stunning .
who cares if she can act or not .
each scene is a work of art
composed and captured by john derek .
the location 
set design 
and costume function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty 
youth and wealth .
in some way i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek 's story .
and ... this commantary would not be complete
without mantioning anthony quinn 's role as father 
mantor 
lover 
and his portrayal of a man 
of man 
lost to a bygone era
when man were man .
there are some of us
who find value in strength and direction
wrapped in a confidence
that contributes to a sense of confidence 
containmant 
and security .
yes 
they do not make man like that anymore !
but 
then how often do you find woman
who are made like bo derek .
