this british film is truly awful ,
and it is hard to believe
that glenn ford is in it ,
although he pretty much sleepwalk through it .
the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good ...
but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film !
no action 
no movement 
just a static train .
the area where the train is parked is evacuated ,
so it is not like there is any danger
to anyone either .
in fact 
this film could be used in a film class
to show
how not to make a suspense film .
true suspense is generated
by letting the audience know thing
that the character do not ,
a fact apparently unknown to the director .
spoiler :
the train actually has two bombs on it ,
but we are led to believe
there is only one .
after the first bomb is defused ,
it feels
as if there is no longer a reason
to watch the film any more .
but at the last minute 
the villain ,
who has no apparent motivation for his action ,
reveal there are two .
nor are we certain
when the bombs will go off ,
so we do not even have a classic `` ticking bomb '' tension sequence .
a good 10 minute or more are spent watching glenn ford 's french wife
thinking about leaving him ,
and then wondering
where he is .
she is such an annoying character
that we do not care
whether she reconciles with him ,
so
when she does ,
there is nothing emotional about it .
most of the other character are fairly devoid of personality ,
and none have any problem or issue .
it is only 72 minute ,
but it feels long
because it is tedious and dull .
do not waste your time .
