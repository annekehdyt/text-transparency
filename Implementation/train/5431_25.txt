i can only believe
that garson kanin must have been two person .
the one
who wrote the illiant `` a double life '' and the funny `` born yesterday ''
and co-wrote such excellent screenplay as `` adam 's rib '' and `` pat and mike '' with his wife ruth gordon and then the one
who wrote and/or
directed such tiresome 
sad drivel as `` bachelor mother '' 
`` some kind of a nut '' 
and this .
the cast try ,
but the script is so tired and clich\u00e9d
that even the effort of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated .
the script sinks
to it is nadir in the truly offensive sequence
in which janssen 's character tests drivas 's character
to make sure
he is not gay .
an ugly sequence 
but sadly one
which could easily play in a film today .
`` ethnic '' joke are now totally verboten ,
but `` fag '' joke are still `` good 
clean 
family fun '' .
