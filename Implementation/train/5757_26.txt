rented the movie as a joke .
my friend and i had so much fun laughing at it
that i went and found a used copy
and bought it for myself .
now when all my friend are looking for a funny movie
i
give them sasquatch hunter .
it needs to be said
though there is a rule
that was made
that made the movie
that much better .
no talking is allowed
while the movie is on unless
the word are sasquatch repeated in a chant .
i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well .
`` thank for the jeep 
tom ! ''
whoever tom is i say
thank you
because
without your jeep the movie may not have been made .
in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at .
if you want a good movie maybe look for something else
but if you do not mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit
grab yourself a copy .
