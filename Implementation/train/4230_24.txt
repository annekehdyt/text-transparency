after 30 second 
you already realize
that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off .
the story is taken from great movie like `` texas chainsaw massacre ''
and `` hill have eye '' .
i like those kind of movie ,
even if they are duplicated well
( wrong turn 
timber falls 
carver ) .
but `` side sho '' is hard to watch :
the actor are really bad ,
the dialogue is cheesy
and the music is stupid and totally misplaced .
you do not care at all what happens to the character .
the so-called bad guy are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical .
so how about the blood and gore ?
well there is some ,
although it is rather cheap
and the action is executed very poorly .
2 point 
just for the gore and blood but do understand
that this is hardly worth a look 
even for the gore-hounds..
