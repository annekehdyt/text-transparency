to make a film straddling the prequel and the `` real '' star war trilogy would tax even a great film-maker ... .mr lucas is not that film-maker.to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor ... mr christensen is not that actor.the first 60-80 minute are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pocket of yet more light sae fight
but there is a lack of edge
because you already know
which main character survive to the original star war.count dooku
( christopher lee )
has a very fleeting role here
and about the best idea is to have jar jar bink silent !
no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi
and has one great
( overlong )
sequence at the lava falls
