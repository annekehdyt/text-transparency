i hated this show
when i was a kid .
that was back in the day
when kid show character
actually had accent ,
not just the bland 
generic 
general american dialect we are used to .
jack wild had a british accent
and pufnstuf 's was southern .
like one of the other mentioned 
though 
i never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute .
that always seemed odd to me ,
probably because the flute just annoyed me and i would not have gone to any trouble
to take it away !
just a comment on the similarity of pufnstuf to early 70s mcdonald commercial
that other have mentioned :
pufnstuf ripped off mcdonald .
at the height of mcdonald popularity 
the tv show
( or rather 
their creator )
sought to license mcdonald character for their show ,
but
when mcdonald declined the tv show changed the character slightly
and passed it as their own .
they even hired former employee of mcdonald ad agency and the voice actor
to make the tv show .
mcdonald sued and won .
search for pufnstuf mcdonaldland lawsuit and you will find plenty of article about it .
