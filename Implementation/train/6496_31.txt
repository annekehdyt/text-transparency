when i watch a low budget film i
know what to expect .
i expect the acting not to be as good
( budget reason ) ,
i expect the lighting not to be as good
( budget reason )
i expect the sound not to be as good
( budget again ) .
stop judging these low budget movie like a big budget film ! ! !
i am a filmmaker myself
so i understand the budget constraint on a low budget film .
stealing location 
shot etc ...
the list goes on and on .
i do not want to say
all the acting was bad .
jose rosete 
chris angelo 
victor zaragoza are good .
raul martinez is a natural .
not sold on carl washington yet .
he has to understand
that every line is not important ,
some are throw away line .
i say
if a film makes you want to see what happens next ,
it is a good film .
i liked this movie .
i gave it an 8. i
wanted to see what was gon na happen next .
great job quiroz other !
