i wanted to see valentine ever
since i saw
that denise richard and marley shelton were in it
because they had played in some of my favorite movie ever .
when i watched valentine ,
i was amazed at how great the story line actually was .
it kills me to see
that it has a low rating
because it was not horrible at all .
the actor and actress played the part wonderfully and the way
it ended was so illiant and cunning .
some scene were a little unbelievable and or poor ,
and i admit at a few minor part
it got just a small bit boring ,
but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful .
it had a mind-twisting story line
which made you guess the whole way
through and it does not deserve all the crap it gets .
i recommend this movie to watch anytime 
but especially on valentine 's day
because it is sure to give you a ton of chill .
oh ,
and do not even pay attention to the trailer or rating 
please ,
do not ...
