the good :
i liked this movie
because it was the first horror movie i
have seen in a long time
that actually scared me .
the acting was not too bad ,
and the `` cupid '' killer was believable and disturbing.the bad :
the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak .
there just was not much to it .
the way
the killer killed his victim was very horrifying and disgusting .
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
who can not handle gore.overall :
a good scare 
but a bad story .
** out of *****
