being a fan of silent film ,
i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time .
i was pretty disappointed .
as has been mentioned ,
the film seems to be one long 
long 
commercial for the maxwell automobile .
perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length
that it is ,
i may have enjoyed the film more .
but it got old very fast .
and while i recognize
that reality is stretched many time in film ,
without lessening a viewer 's enjoyment ,
what was with the mexican bandit ?
i mean 
they are chasing a car through the mountain 
a car
that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour ,
yet they can not catch up to it ?
