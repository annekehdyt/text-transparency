remember the early day of pay per view ?
i do 
and i can almost remember
the number you had to call
to actually rent the movie on your t.v .
as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy ,
but this meant actually calling someone from ppv
and asking to rent it .
and then you get the nerve to do it
and your watching four hour of soft core no angle crap .
well the reason i ing
that up is because this movie too was on ppv .
and i remember almost every scene
that was in the add .
i have been on a kick in the last few year
to obtain all the great movie i use
to see as a kid and this was one of them .
it is one that when its on its hard to shut off .
all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust
but nothing goes right .
there are plenty of spoof bank caper
that are good
and this one has to fall in that category .
it has enough action and laughs
to sustain it .
check it out
if you dare !
