for anyone
who may not know what a one-actor movie was like ,
this is the best example .
this plot is ridiculous ,
and really makes no sense .
it is full of cliched situation 
hackneyed line 
melodrama 
comedy ...
you name it !
but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing ,
and this movie is by no mean an exception .
everyone turns in a decent performance - shashi kapoor 
waheeda rehman 
ranjit 
om prakash 
smita patil ...
but it is the megastar
who overshadows everyone with his towering presence .
without him 
this movie would have been a non-starter ...
the story is about separation / mistaken identity / misunderstanding / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything 
really !
amitabh 's is a illiant performance on all count 
in an otherwise silly film !
and did i mention
that it is ridiculously funny ?
