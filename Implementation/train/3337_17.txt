the youthful group in `` st. elmo 's fire ''
who just graduated from college barely
seem able to make it through high school much less four year at any prominent university .
for the most part 
these kid are irresponsible 
selfish 
greedy and stupid ,
yet co-writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstone for a generation .
with a now-outdated cast of `` up and comer '' 
a background score
that sounds awfully similar to that of `` term of endearment '' ,
and writing
which lords the smugness of this circle over us ,
`` fire '' is a paltry blaze 
one
that gets even more embarrassing as the year pass on .
