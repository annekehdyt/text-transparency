as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan 
i can withstand any motion picture
that can be foisted upon me ,
but there is absolutely no reason for this.rated `` super action '' in the blockbuster video section
and given the dreaded `` restricted viewing sticker '' i am
assuming these are the only method
that film maker
( ha ! )
robert napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.shame on you robert napton !
shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actor
who you probably promised hope
for making it big in american cinema .
you are a disgrace !
there is not one moment in this movie
that holds the slightest bit of action .
did you use snot on these person ?
oh 
look 
they are having a rave in a field !
like all 6 of them .
and is not that an asian guy in the background ?
why is it always daytime ?
why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly
why did we watch the other 1/2 ? ps :
you owe me 4.50 .
