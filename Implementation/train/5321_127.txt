kim
( patricia clarkson ) ,
george
( jake weber )
and son mile
( erik per sullivan )
are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan 's bustling metropolis .
on the way 
they hit a buck
and end up stuck in the snow .
a group of hunter
who were tracking the buck come along .
rather than helping 
at least one of the hunter 
otis
( john speredakos ) ,
is mad
because the accident cracked the buck 's antler .
george 
kim and mile are disturbed by otis ,
and even worse 
we quickly learn
that otis has learned
where they are staying .
meanwhile 
mile is given a wendigo
( a kind of indian shape-shifting spirit/monster )
token by an indian
whom
only he has seen .
is otis a psycho out to get our hero ?
are there wendigo in the wood ?
i can see
where wendigo would have a number of problem appealing to viewer .
it is a fairly low budget film ,
with technical limitation frequently showing through .
much of the film ,
and maybe all of it 
is not really about the titular creature .
and perhaps the fatal blow for many person ,
it has a very ambiguous ending 
with a number of question left unanswered .
if you are discouraged by such ending ,
and you do not like film
that have an aim
of making you
think
about and discuss what everything meant ,
do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo.personally 
i like film like that .
i usually prefer some ambiguity .
the marketing of wendigo is geared toward those
who want a quick 
scary creature flick ,
where they had expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster
who is defeated in the end ,
and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 :
the monster return ,
but that is not what this film is .
wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most person .
heck 
writer/director larry fessenden even has a character 
george 
reciting robert frost .
the frost poem 
and george 's comment
that frost can evoke complex imagery
and atmosphere out of seemingly simple thing ,
is the key to the film.one of the best thing
about the film is its complexity .
in a way 
there are four different film occurring at the same time 
a thread from each character .
in george 's thread 
he is not exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world ,
and he has some parenting problem .
for him 
the film is a realistic ,
horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse .
in patricia 's thread 
she is looking for rejuvenation of her life and family .
she is a psychologist mostly denying the problem around her ,
hoping
that they will go away and get better .
in otis ' thread 
he is even more down on his luck than george 
and george 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final `` crack '' in his psychological armor .
and in mile ' thread ,
which is probably the most important of the film ,
life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world .
but this is a horror story ,
after all 
albeit one with a glimmer of hope ,
and the event in the film give mile ' poetic interpretation a dark turn .
still ,
when everything is said and done ,
he seems to be the only one retaining his composure 
due to the poetic outlook.even
though the film is low budget ,
there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambition .
fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shot in beautiful location ,
and created some interesting slide show like montage
( such as the card 
or the indian wendigo image from the book ) .
there are also interesting more traditional montage 
such as mile ' nightmare .
wendigo is better shot
and edited than many big budget film.other technical aspect are good for the budget .
the `` wendigo '' appearance at the end worked for me
and was appropriately ambiguous .
the lighting was usually good
-- there were a few time
that dark scene were not as clear
as they could have been ,
but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock
( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer .
i thought
the performance were good and far more realistic
( if you value that )
than the majority of film .
although i did not really notice the score ,
it must have been okay ,
or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment.overall ,
wendigo is a very good film
that deserves to be watched
without preconception ,
as long as you do not mind having to think about the movie you watch .
