i first saw `` breaking glass '' in 1980 ,
and thought
that it would be one of the `` movie classic '' .
this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performer .
this is one film
that should be in the collection of everyone and any one
that wants to get into the music industry .
i can not wait for it to be available on dvd .
