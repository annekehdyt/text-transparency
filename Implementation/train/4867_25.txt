you know
the story - a group of plucky no-hoper enter a competition
they seemingly have no chance of winning -
it is a tale
that has been done to death by hollywood
( bring it on 
the karate kid 
escape to victory 
best of the best etc ) .
now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory \u0096
and guess
what \u0096 the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying.the fact
that this movie does not fall flat on its face
is down to the talented young cast
who really make you care about the character ,
and this in turn
keep you watching to the end.fan of your typical martial art movie
may be disappointed \u0096 taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of move and acrobatic
seen in most kung fu film ;
the action is limited to ( albeit impressive )
kicking and the occasional punch .
this does not matter though ,
since it is the interaction of the character and their fight
to make something of themselves
which makes this movie a success .
