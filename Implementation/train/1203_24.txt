the scarecrow was on of the funniest killer i
have ever seen in the act !
plus he is really bouncy most of the time
he jumped around ,
which was awesome !
also he had an excellent voice i
mean it was just perfect for him .
the story line was excellent too .
i like how the kid soul was transferred into scarecrow
that was cool !
plus he did have a reason for all
that
killing i mean after what those person did to him ... ..i
would be angry too !
scarecrow look was really good !
his look gives that person an `` omg ! ''
reaction when they see him !
which was great the stare he
got were funny !
those person were stupid ,
who would stare for that long !
they should of glanced
and ran for their life ...
even though that would not of made a difference !
