red rock west is one of those rare film
that keeps you guessing the entire time
as to what will happen next .
nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer
as he enters a small town
trying
to find work .
dennis hopper is the bad guy
and no one plays them better .
look for a ief appearance by country
singing star dwight yoakam .
this is a serious drama most of the time
but there are some lighter moment .
what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort !
