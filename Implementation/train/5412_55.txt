this film appears to draw a borderline - on one side 
those
who love it ,
on the other 
those
who find it unbearable.to begin with ,
there is an awful lot of comedy in this film
that many viewer are not `` getting '' .
of course jet li 's mask looks like bruce lee 's kato -
he is supposed to ,
it is a joke .
the guy
who has a time-bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous ?
of course 
it is a joke !
some reader will probably ask ,
if this film is supposed to be so funny ,
why all the excessive and gory violence ?
well 
for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different 
from culture to culture ;
and
while hong kong audience would recognize
this violence is extreme ,
it is certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action film.also ,
black mask is really the kind of film
that takes a genre 's convention and pushes them to extremes ,
simply because the convention themselves are wholly unrealistic .
after decade of watching person get shot
without any noticeable open wound ,
many person were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the outlaws of the wild bunch spurting blood all over the place .
but the fact is ,
when you are shot with rapid metal projectile ,
it is almost certain
that blood will spurt ,
especially from an artery.this film is a chinese comic book movie .
it is true that the spiderman films never get this gory -
but if they were faithful to reality ,
they would be !
well ,
despite its comic-book origin ,
this film is faithful to reality.the
only complaint i have is the flashy 
over-stylized filming and editing .
if the maker of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywood-style nostalgia
( as 
e.g. 
the rocketeer 
or the recent sky captain film ) ,
i doubt
anyone would have found
it offensive.but
as it stands ,
i still had a lotta fun
watching this movie .
