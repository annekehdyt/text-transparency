trapped :
buried alive ings us to a resort
that has just opened ,
and is soon to close.we start with a guy in gear blowing up drift ,
to avoid the possibility of avalanch .
somehow 
that does not make sense .
anyway 
he is about to blow away one particularly big one ,
when he notices
the resort is open .
despite his best effort ,
higher authority tells him his day is over.soon ,
as everyone expects 
an avalanche hits.look 
i am not gon na reveal any more ,
all i can say
is this was a b-movie
designed for the family channel
( which i just saw it on ,
and the fact
it had no commercial proves
it is a b-movie ) anyway ,
it is a pretty decent film ,
but it is partially unreal.firsthand ,
when person are buried by ice and snow ,
they are buried .
not just traced by powder .
or 
what about a cd for a screwdriver ?
it is not possible .
and finally ,
what i can not stress enough ,
is that
an explosion can not stop a avalanche 
guaranteed.furthermore ,
it is worth a rental or a tv viewing ,
but not owning .
7/10.the movie is rated pg ,
but maybe it should have received something a little more strong .
a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator ,
but his leg is cut around the ankle ,
a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel ,
and in the weight room 
dead person are laying around.enjoy .
