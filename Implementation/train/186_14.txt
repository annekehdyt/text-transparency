i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release 
in a justifiably empty theater .
believe it or not ,
after decade of watching movie ,
this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ; or at least the worst
that i would allow myself to watch.the acting
is far beneath the standard
set by any random group of drunken high-school student yanked off the street
and forced to learn their line in 5 minute or less.after the first shock of disbelief ,
we laughed for a while
as each scene hit new lows .
but after a while 
even that dubious pleasure wore off
and it just got to be really sad .
