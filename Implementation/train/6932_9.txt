the first one was different and funny .
this attempt should have never left the studio .
this movie does not make you laugh .
it is a weak attempt at gross out humor .
the movie picks out current and old movie to rip-off .
this time the joke seem used and overdone .
the audience
that i saw it with only re-acted to hannibal dinner scene
and was otherwise asleep .
