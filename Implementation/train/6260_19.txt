i very much looked forward to this movie .
its a good family movie ; however ,
if michael landon jr. 's editing team did a better job of editing ,
the movie would be much better .
too many scene out of context .
i do hope
there is another movie from the series ,
they are all very good .
but ,
if another one is made ,
i beg them to take better care at editing .
this story was all over the place
and did not seem to have a center .
which is unfortunate
because the other movie of the series were great .
i enjoy the story of willie and missy ;
they are both great role model .
plus 
the romantic side of the viewer always enjoy a good love story .
