it is my opinion
that
when you decide to re-make a very good film ,
you should strive to do better than the original ;
or at least give it a fresh point of view .
now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jackson 's remarkable novel `` the haunting of hill house '' is worth the price of admission even today .
now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make .
i was left shaking my head and asking 
why ?
the acting is wooden ,
the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effect computer can generate .
i had heard
that this update was bad ;
but could not believe
it was that bad ,
considering the source material .
i was wrong .
after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was ,
she said ;
`` well they got your money ! ''
she is right ,
do not let them get your .
if there is no profit in making lousy re-make ,
maybe they will stop making them or come up to a higher standard
that does not insult their audience
