this was my first introduction to the world of bollywood and i am
now hooked !
okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset
to watching us film
but once you allow yourself the pleasure
of enjoying
it for what it is you
will not be disappointed .
the song are superb 
melodic and very catchy .
the actor are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor
who is surely one of the most beautiful actress anywhere in the film world .
location 
colmy are spellbinding .
if you want something different
and are looking to be uplifted ,
cheered up and stimulated i recommend you catch this movie .
