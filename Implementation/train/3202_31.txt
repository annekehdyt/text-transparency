lorenzo lamas star as some type of cium agent ,
who captures some exotic beauty
named alexa 
kidnaps her daughter and forces her
to fight her former employer .
o.j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble .
i must admit
i am not a fan of lorenzo lamas 
or his movie .
he stinks .
however
when compared to o.j simpson and lamas ' comatose wife kinmont ,
lamas seems like ah 
jean-claude van damme .
i only saw cium
because of the renewed interest around the o.j simpson trial ,
you see
because
if your parent had cable and the extra channel ,
you could not escape this movie .
in 1994 you could go to an amish community
and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv .
the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequence
and would be intrigue
although the shock value of o.j simpson
jumping after fireball and exchanging would be one liner
do provide some unintentional humor .
also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant
to make this a complete camp classic ?
