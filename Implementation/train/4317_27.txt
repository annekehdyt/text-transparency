this review may contain some spoilers.the remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie
gone in 60 second begins well .
actually it is well acted
and the plot moves quite well .
but even a big hollywood budget does not change the fact
that the original plot was more believable .
for those
who do not know ,
the original plot had the thieve working as insurance inspector .
who would suspect them .
but even with a change to nearly every aspect of h.b .
halicki 's original 
the remake is a very good movie ,
until we get to the final chase scene ,
the part of the 74 version
that made it great .
the one in this version is watered down 
only 10 minute ,
and it culminates in a monster special effect
that takes all believability out of the chase .
where the original chase was very believable ,
the star was a stunt driver
who did all his own stunt ,
the remake falls flat in the last 15 minute .
my advice ,
if you want to watch a classic car chase film ,
fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake .
