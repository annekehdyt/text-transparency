i agree with the majority of the comment i have seen written .
i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the person
who have written comment
were even born .
i was born in 1964 ,
so i was 5-yrs-old
when seseme street was introduced to television .
the show taught me my number
( the count ) ,
spelling
( the muppet ) ,
and about life .
i liked all the old character
( big bird 
oscar 
grover 
and cookie monster )
and do not quite understand
why they had to change .
i understand
that everything has to change in some way ,
but to make cookie monster into a `` veggie monster ''
to promote healthy eating .
the show has introduced new character and monster
since it is inception ,
why not make a separate `` veggie monster ''
that talks/discusses the benefit of eating a varied diet with cookie monster .
but 
back to my point .
i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street ,
my now 20 yr-old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her ,
and we discussed mr. hooper dying ,
although he had died prior to her being born ,
as well as other topic on the show .
i saw the episode as a older child ,
and still remember
how well they portrayed the event 
much like real life .
and i am sure
it hit the cast extremely hard as all death and loss effect family .
you saw this on the show
and it allowed parent and child to discuss very difficult event .
the show has talked about traditional family 
adoptive family and combined family .
it is one of the few show
that actually discusses these scenario .
i now have a 5 yr-old daughter
who really does not watch ss .
i have tried to watch the show a couple of time 
but ,
it really is not what it used to be .
the elmo 1/2 hr with mr. noodle is absolutely ridiculous .
like many person have said ,
it does not teach anything .
it is geared for the less than 18 month old
( maybe ) ,
and is not even funny .
i always prided myself on watching ss as a child 
teen 
and adult with my own child .
now on my second go-round 
i really have a hard time watching ss .
the topic
that were discussed :
death 
marriage 
non-traditional family 
new to neighborhood ,
moving away were related to child and adult in a manner easy for 2-99 year old to understand and relate to .
now 
there are no concept taught 
minimal counting 
only the occasional mention of the alphabet .
it is not the same ss 
from an original watcher of the show .
please
if any producer from the show read these comment ,
return the show to its foundation .
new concept have never been a problem with ss ,
they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show .
