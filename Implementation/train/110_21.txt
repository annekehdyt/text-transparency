this is a terrible movie ,
terrible script 
bad direction and nonsensical ending .
also 
bad performance 
except from clancy brown
who is criminally underused here ,
and michael pollard .
watching this movie was purgatory
-- you do it to unload enough bad movie karma
to actually see a good one further down the line.the movie presents a father and son
who look like they could not every possibly
have been related .
the part of the male lead is not well written
and seems uncharismatic in this role .
you can see the plot points a mile away .
the action of the female lead and that of her other 
the cop 
also make no sense .
so 
a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise .
