a pretty worthless made for television movie
that pretty much follows the killer insect script .
ant mysteriously turn into killer ant near a hotel .
i think
it is from the hotel food
because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed .
there is a lack of suspense in this film
and it is not scary either .
watching a bunch of ant sting their victim is not very terrifying.spoiler section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible .
he is told that the health inspector
that the ant could not be the hero .
it has to be a mysterious virus .
after the inspector says this ,
the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony .
this disturbs the million of ant and traps the person in the hotel.end spoiler overall ,
this movie is extremely lame .
i do not understand
why it got a dvd release
when so many deserving movie have none .
my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summer is featured in the film .
this is a movie
to avoid .
