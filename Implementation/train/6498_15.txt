what made the original killer tomato fun was it was made by person with no budget
who were just being wacky for a couple of day ... this
was something with a budget ,
but it just was not as much fun .
john astin of adam family fame is actually making an effort here
to be comedic ,
but he is supported by lame actor 
cheap special effect and unfunny gags.the plot .
dr. gangrene
( astin )
escapes from a french prison
and decide
he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france ... the hero 
his french girlfriend and the gizmo-like `` fuzzy tomato '' decide
they are going to stop him ... forgettable direct to video nonsense ...
