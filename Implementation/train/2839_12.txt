the master of movie spectacle cecil b. de mille goes west .
using three legend of the old west as its protagonist
( they probably never met ) ,
gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock 
james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane .
the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequence on ,
like the big indian attack.scene
like that are extremely well done.if
you do not mind
the somewhat over-the-top performance of the cast this is an very entertaining western.look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian ave
who participated at the battle of little big horn.this part
got him at least noticed in hollywood .
