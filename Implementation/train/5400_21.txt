this movie surely has one of the strangest theme in history
-- right up there with ed wood 's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in `` glen or glenda ?
`` the subject :
playing idge .
the park avenue set plays it ;
the bohemian play it .
the russians
-- who speak very questionable `` russian ''
and have most unconvincing accent
when they speak english --
play it at the restaurant
where they work.if one
is not interested in idge 
one --
even despite the great cast --
is not likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.loretta young and paul lukas
are fine .
( well --
frank mchugh is an unlikely ghost writer --
as lukas is an unlikely russian . )
but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script .
