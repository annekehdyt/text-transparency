gypo nolan
( victor mclaglen )
is as poor as anyone on earth .
living in 1920s ireland ,
gypo and his fellow irishman are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive brit .
one particular rebel 
wanted for murder by the english ,
arrives back into town secretly .
he thinks
he can trust his friend gypo ,
but the \u00a320 reward proves too tempting .
gypo gets his friend killed and sink into a pit of despair and drunkenness .
meanwhile 
the other irish rebel are searching for the informer .
right away 
gypo 
with money
burning a hole in his pocket ,
is their main suspect ,
but they ,
who are his friend ,
do not want to believe it .
the story of the informer is simple in its plot ,
but complex in its moral and emotional issue .
it is easily one of john ford 's most emotionally
involving film .
what gypo did was wrong ,
but we can certainly understand his motive .
we also understand his sorry character ,
and there is a lot of sympathy
that arises for him .
the script is very suspenseful 
as well .
it is the kind of suspense
where we are pretty sure
we know
how everything will end up ,
so we have to grit our tooth and bear along with it .
the acting is remarkable .
victor mclaglen ,
who acted in many of ford 's film ,
probably gave his best performance here
( and won an oscar for it ) .
every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos .
in addition to an amazing script and acting ,
the informer is one of john ford 's most expressionistic film .
i love the darker side of ford .
in its mood 
as well as in its theme 
the informer reminds me of two of my other favorite ford film 
the long voyage home
( 1940 )
and the fugitive
( 1948 ) ;
it is also a bit similar to the grape of wrath
( 1940 )
in these respect .
10/10 .
