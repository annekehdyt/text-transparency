if you like cb4 ,
you have no idea
what you are missing
if you have not seen this film yet .
this movie is crazy hilarious ,
and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ...
it is unfortunate
that this movie has not been released on dvd
because it is one movie
that everybody i have ever watched it with has loved
and wanted a copy .
if you really want a good laugh
and you like hip hop
and are a little familiar with some old-school performer 
definitley rent this movie .
there are not that many video rental place
that have copy of it ,
but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed .
