i found this movie to be a great idea ,
that did not deliver .
it seems
they found a way
to build suspense ,
but could not stage their payoff very well .
in one case the police 
are on the clock
to find the hideout of the kidnapper .
they painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record .
at the same time 
the kidnapped man
( mason )
escapes through the elevator shaft .
after all the build up ,
the police arrive at the same time he gets free ,
which is very anti-climatic to say the least .
there are also large narration scene
that take us `` inside the thinking '' of the terrorized husband and wife ,
which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it .
we are fully aware of their tension ,
and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear ,
as hitchcock proved time and again 
is far more effective .
the greatest disappointment 
is to sit through the whole movie ,
and the get the quick 
rather bland ending .
i mean it just ... '' end '' in a snore .
