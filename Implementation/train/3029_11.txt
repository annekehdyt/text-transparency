the cast is excellent 
the acting good 
the plot interesting 
the evolvement full of suspense ...
but it is hard to cram all those element into a film
that is barely 80 minute long .
if more time was taken
to develop the plot and subplot ,
it would have a much better effect .
another 30 minute of substance would have made this a very good film
rather then just a good one .
