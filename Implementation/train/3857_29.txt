i was excited to see a sitcom
that would hopefully represent indian candian
but i found this show to be not funny at all .
the producer and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back
because as far as they are concerned
it is getting talked about !
i was ready for some stereotyping
and have no problem with it
because stereotype exist for a reason ,
they are usually true .
but there really was not anything funny about these stereotypical character .
the `` fresh of the boat '' dad ,
who does not understand his daughter .
the radical feminist muslim daughter
( who by the way
is a terrible actress ) ,
and the young modern indian man
trying to run his mosque as politically correct
as he can
( he is a pretty good actor ,
i only see him getting better )
.it is very contrived
and the dialog does not flow that well .
there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think
it failed ,
and do not really care to watch another episode.i did however enjoy
watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again ,
she is always a treat and a natural at everything she does ,
too bad her daughter in the show does not have the same acting ability !
