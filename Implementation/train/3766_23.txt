the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea ,
and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest .
but 
throughout watching this film ,
we were saying aloud ,
`` these filmmaker go to the trouble
of finding good location ,
the lighting is good 
makeup and hair are good ...
why is the sound so bad ? ''
throughout the film the sound was echoy 
garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.there is some good acting in this film ,
and i think
jim thalman is really a good actor .
this story 
with some of the same actor 
would have been worth
doing as a high-budget film.i just can not reiterate enough -
if you have a limited budget 
dedicate more to good sound .
sound is as much a part of a film as the image ,
and it is worth doing right .
could have earned a 6 .
