the whole point
of making this film ,
one of the earliest and best international color release of cinematic opera ,
was to make it more accessible to the mass .
and it succeeded admirably in doing so .
the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lover in ancient egypt
if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment
to sing the glorious music properly .
hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principal
( a young loren 
handsome della marra 
and a slinky ms. maxwell )
who make the story much more believable ,
giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance
at being wooed into the lovely arias
who otherwise might not be .
altogether 
an enchanting introduction to one of verdi 's great work .
i remember seeing this
when i was in junior high school
and it certainly awakened my interest in opera 
a form
with which i was then not well acquainted .
i still regard this film fondly
and would recommend it highly to those
who might appreciate the great music
accompanied by better than average visual .
luciano della marra was a standout as radame ,
and unfortunately for audience did not appear in any other film .
