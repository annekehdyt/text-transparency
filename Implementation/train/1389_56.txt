since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movie
when i was little ,
i was curious about its sequel.the little mermaid
( one )
is a classic animated feature with top quality everything 
a grand music score ,
and targets a general audience .
in contrast 
the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young child ,
because it is spontaneous ,
reflects a child 's self perspective ,
the music is bouncier and less dramatic ,
and the ending feel like recess.the little mermaid 2 start out
when baby melody is presented to ariel 's side of the family .
auptly
without any visual cue
to aid the drama ,
a giant tentacle grabs the baby .
i laughed 
wait a minute
it is not funny ,
the baby 's being attacked !
okay 
i will stop laughing .
morgana 's crime in oad daylight and her spontaneity 
takes away potential drama
since it happened so quickly.throughout the feature 
melody seems superhuman ,
which i defend is how most child envision themselves .
this quality in melody 's character is clearly ought out toward the end
when she fights morgana
without an inch of fear on her face.like the first movie ,
melody has a lot of ariel 's problem 
except the reverse .
queen ariel turns out to be like her father
by restricting her from the ocean ,
whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface .
ariel and melody both rebel against their parent.the music is more emotionally moving in the first .
this sequel has a bunch of song ,
but not as much orchestral work went into it .
it is great for little one ,
because it does not take an orchestra
to impress them.the
ending in the first movie
was strong and uplifting .
the sequel ends with a bouncy song
and everyone playing in the water .
it is definitely more targeted at kid ,
because instead of the ending
being solemn
and leaving you blown away ,
this ending leaves you thinking ,
`` it is time for recess ! ''
ultimately 
this movie is fun for kid ,
so we should let them have fun .
