i have seen it .
it is not `` good '' but interesting in an understated way .
the boy in it are quite naturalistic but ... ... ... ... ...
.the graphic/gratuitous final gang rape scene
is repugnant
and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way
it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance .
real atrocity is real-
this film is just atrocious .
however 
the film has a look
which can draw you in .
but it seems to me that is the `` emperor 's new clothe '' 
but in fact in reverse .
the film looks good ,
but the direction 
story 
content and final feeling
you take away from this film
is vacuous .
if a feeling can be vacuous-this is it .
