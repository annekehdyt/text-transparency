sorry everyone 


i know
this is supposed to be an `` art '' film 
,
but wow 
they should have handed out gun at the screening
so person could blow their ain out and not watch .
although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent ,
this story is too painful to watch .
the absence of a sound track was utal .
the loooonnnnng shot were too long .
how long can you watch two person just sitting there and talking ?
especially when the dialogue is two person complaining .
i really had a hard time
just getting through this film .
the performance were excellent ,
but how much of that dark 
some 
uninspired 
stuff can you take ?
the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene .
otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman .
and i am no fan f his either .
i think anyone
who says
they enjoyed 1 1/2 hour of this is 

well 
lying .
