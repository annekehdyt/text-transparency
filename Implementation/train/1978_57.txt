envy stars some of the best .
jack black 
ben stiller 
amy poehler 
and the great christopher walken .
with such a cast 
one can only expect the best .
however 
with `` envy '' 
no one could save this disaster.tim dingman
( stiller )
and nick vanderpark
( black )
are best friend and co-worker at a sandpaper factory .
both are making a decent living ,
but
because tim has a better performance at work ,
he is able to afford more than his buddy nick .
nick is a dreamer
who 's always coming up with new idea for invention .
one day 
nick comes up with the idea for a spray can
that makes dog poop disappear
( yes ,
i am serious ) .
falling in love with the idea ,
nick decide to really invent this product .
he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profit 50/50 .
tim refuses thinking
the idea will never work.nick 's invention ,
titled `` va-poo-rize ''
( again ,
i am serious ) ,
ends up making million .
he enjoys spending his money on thing like a much larger house 
a horse 
a personal trainer 
and fancy desert .
tim starts feeling envy for nick .
hence the name of the movie.the concept is not bad ,
but it still turns out awful .
this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performance from all the cast .
then again ,
as i mentioned earlier ,
none of them could save this mess .
not even the great christoper walken ,
playing a homeless character
named `` j-man '' ,
made this movie funny .
the movie is bad from the start
and only continues to get worse.i recommend this movie if :
*you like crap
( no pun intended )
*you want to see jack black in a white tuxi say ,
avoid this movie at all cost ,
but avoid especially if :
*you are offended by bathroom humor *you love animal
