this film is an entertaining 
fun and quality film .
the film very cleverly follows the guideline if the book ,
and try to stick to the exact line .
the actor are all suitable ,
and you would expect them to be the part .
they use some famous actor
which give a great effect on the film .
the graphic is a bit dodgy in some part ,
and there are quite a few mistake throughout the film .
there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard 
for example .
the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book ,
and they tend not to show the going on in the camp as much as the book .
all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book ,
but are not in the film .
overall 
a great film for a rainy afternoon
