this service comedy ,
for which peter marshall
( joanne dru 's other and later perennial host of the hollywood square )
and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin ' is just shy of dreadful :
a few random sight gag are inserted ,
everyone talk fast
and nothing work quite right -- there is one scene in which noonan is throwing grenade at officer and politician in anger ;
they are about five foot apart ,
noonan is throwing them in between ,
and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar ,
there are a few moment of ightness :
marshall and noonan engage in occasional bout of double talk and argufying ,
and their timing is nigh unto perfect
-- clearly
they were a well honed comedy pair.it
is not enough
to save this turkey 
alas .
