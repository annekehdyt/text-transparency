i do not care
if you would like my comment or no
but i think
that you who write
that the movie is not good..you are so obsessed by the film of hollywood
that you can not see how good is this movie i am not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his ...
and may be you think
that there is not a big sense in the idea
and may be you think
it is not so interesting
but look deeply there is more than action in the movie more than love and passion and tear there is more than usa in the world
and it is good : )
really good .
and it cost a lot
to do it so please do not criticize the actor the director cause
you do not know
how hard they work for you
to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you : )
