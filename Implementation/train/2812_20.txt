if the screenwriter and director intended to open heart with the movie
as the musician wanted to do with his music ,
they succeeded with me .
commonplace human situation became original 
personal and immediate so
that i personally felt touched by each situation .
i believe
i would credit the power of music
combined with the point of view of the person
writing the movie .
without spoiling ,
i can say
that i was very moved by the movie 's approach to living .
have not actually cried out of-what- joy ?
empathy ?
just deep emotion ?
in a very long time .
i would love to find a way
to show it to other .
saw it at seattle international film festival .
