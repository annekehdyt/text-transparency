not a `woman film ' but film for the gang .
one of the worst film ever made by a male director about woman .
director andy mckay simply does not know woman .
peak of bad taste 
american pie 's humor style 
crude story 
no sense 
groundless story 
refuted character .
vulgar fantasy came to life on screen .
insulting and definitely not funny .
i wonder
how three good actress accepted to take part in it .
