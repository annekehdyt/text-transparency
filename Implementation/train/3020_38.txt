it seems there is a bit of a curse out there
when it comes to gay cinema .
namely 
happy ending are not very common .
beautiful thing excluded 
gay film tend to end in oken relationship or untimely death .
and some 
like come undone 
just end ... period.the creator of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two
to learn about plot 
direction 
and timeline .
within the first ten minute of this film ,
i found myself a bit confused ,
and even more so after the first glimpse of jeremie elkaim 's character
having a little psych session .
it seems this film was randomly pieced together
without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency .
there is no real way
to tell
when you are viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback .
i could only take so much
before it became truly unappealing.stephen holden of the new york time
called this film `` ... shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real . ''
well 
it seems
that stephen invested in beer goggle prior to viewing ,
as this is truly far from beautiful .
due to all the praise this film received ,
i expected something worth watching .
sadly 
the film lived down to its title .
and by the end of the movie
( which provided no resolution whatsoever ,
i might add )
it is plain to see
that the writer 
the director and the film have all come undone .
