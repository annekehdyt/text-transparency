i saw this gem of a film at canne
where it was part of the director fortnight.welcome
to collinwood is nothing short of superb .
great fun throughout 
with all member of a strong cast acting their sock off .
it is a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook
( cosimo ,
played by luis guzman )
who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison .
while in prison he meets a `lifer '
who tells him of `the ultimate bellini ' \u0096
which to you
and me \u0096 is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme .
it turns out
that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jeweller shop \u0096
which could net million .
sound simple ?
\u0096 well throw in all kind of wacky character
and incident along the way
and you have got the ingredient for a one wild ride ! !
\u0096 word passes from one low life loser to the next
and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos `bellini ' lead by failed boxer pero
( superbly
played by sam rockwell \u0096 surely a star in the making )
and reluctant crook riley
( william h. macy )
who is forced to ing his baby along with him
as his wife was locked up for fraud !
! .based on the italian film i soliti ignoti
( big deal on madonna street )
which also inspired a similar film to `collinwood ' \u0096 `palookaville ' .
this knocks spot of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo other it definitely has shade of the coen brother about it .
produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney ,
who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe eaker .
