mike brady
( michael garfield
who had a minuscule part in the classic `` the warrior '' )
is the first person in the community
to realize
that there is murderous slug in his small town .
not just any slug 
mind you ,
but carnivorous killer bigger then normal ,
mutated by toxic waste slug
( who still only go as fast as a normal slug ,
which is not that frightening 
but i digress ) .
no one will believe him at first ,
but they will .
oh yes 
they will.ok ,
killer slug are right above psychotic sloth and right below johnathon winter as mork 's baby in the creepiness factor .
so the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go .
the flick is fun somewhat through
and is of the 'so bad
that it is good ' variety .
i appreciate
that they spelled out
that this was slug :
the movie as opposed to slug :
the child 's game or slug :
the other white meat .
probably not worthy of watching it more than once
and promptly forgetting it except
for playing a rather obscure trivia game .
director juan piquer sim\u00f3n is more widely known for his previous film `` pod person ''
( which mst3k deservedly mocked )
and `` peice ''
( which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie
ever made )
eye candy :
kari rose show tanda my grade :
d+ dvd extra :
merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
