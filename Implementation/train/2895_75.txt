certainly not horrible 
but definitely not good.cry 
the beloved country
( 1995 )
was directed by darrell roodt
and written for the screen by ronald harwood
( adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton ) .
starring jame earl jone and richard harris.the film is about pre-apartheid south africa 
and the story of a black man and a white man intertwining .
the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo
( jame earl jone )
receives a letter from johannesburg
saying
that he must come immediumtely ;
he later finds
that his son has killed a man .
the rich farmer/landowner jame jarvis
( richard harris )
finds
that his son 
a fighter for black right 
was the one killed by kumalo 's son .
in this they connect.i can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name ,
for i have not seen it .
or the 1974 musical
titled lost in the star for i
have also not seen it ;
both look better than this one .
but cry freedom 
on the other hand 
i have seen ;
it has a much more urgent air
to it ,
like it actually is trying to say something
where the film cry 
the beloved country seems to have no idea
where it is going .
very `` wishy-washy '' .
i refuse to compare the film to the novel
( except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film )
because novel and film are two extremely different medium
and there is no point
in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.frankly ,
this movie blew .
well 
i guess
it was not that bad 
-- five-out-of-ten 
--
but it was not that good either .
both of the lead 
both very capable actor pull some of the most wooden performance i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history
( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter 
ronald harwood ,
who is also oddly off is game with this film ,
having also written the sublime the pianist ,
and being julia ) .
among other thing
the point and theme of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time ;
there is little 
if any ,
tension with any moment of the film 
racially or suspensefully .
the music does not help .
the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra track really help with this dulling down of the film .
one upside is the cinematography ,
with many rather good or great shot 
but unfortunately 
this does not help the film too much.the last ,
striking word of alan paton 's novel are displayed in the last moment of the film .
it is too bad
that they seem to be so disconnected from the film
that was just shown .
i do not know
what nelson mandela might have seen in this film.thank for your time .
