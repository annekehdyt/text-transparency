unlike many other film ,
which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness
( man bites dog )
or their sheer violence
( most peckinpah film ) ,
deliverance shock by its plausibility .
certainly 
the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness ,
but the film 's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation
surrounding the four lead ,
both before and after everything start to go wrong .
the momant when the cano pass under the child on the idge ,
who does not even acknowledge the man
he had earlier played music with ,
let alone show any sign of human affection towards them ,
is among the most sinister in modern film .
the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip ,
and persevere even after the final credit - the ending makes the significance of the character ' ordeal horrifically real .
the movie 's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the lead 
particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively .
burt reynold 
too 
has never been better .
the film 's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of person
who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory ' -
perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region 's tourist industry .
i can think of only a handful of movie
which put me into such a serious depression
after they had finished -
the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of .
although so much of it is excellent of itself ,
deliverance is a classic above all
because there are no adequate point of comparison with it -
it is unique .
