literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the category
that have been classified for its predecessor 
contemporary ,
and those to follow .
bad special effect 
a weak storyline 
ridiculous amount of blood and gore 
annoying and pointless character 
all
that you can expect .
`` attack of the saetooth '' is about a new vacation resort
where the proprietor are genetically engineering smilodon cat for an attraction .
the cat escape and begin to kill person ,
the guy running the show wants to save them
and not warn the unsuspecting visitor about them ,
and there is a band of visitor and some employee
who rebel and plan
to kill the cat.special effect-wise ,
the film is about an average achievement
given its budget .
the saetooth are portrayed through poor cgi .
amazingly 
though 
the cat look more realistic in an up-close ,
detailed shot rather than the longer ,
more distant shot
where the cgi is better concealed .
their attack are recklessly bloody and distasteful .
just as you would expect ,
they attack 
rip off some arm and leg ,
and leave very little behind .
this is part of the reason
why the film descends into poor schlock.the plot and character are just as horrendous .
we have some college kid
who come to the island
and they plan a scavenger hunt .
and take it very 
very seriously .
even so much as to trespass on private property ,
tamper with security system 
and steal .
why are they taking a simple game so seriously ?
did i miss something ?
was there money involved ?
or were they sent to do it ?
i do not know ,
i could barely follow the film .
but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun
of doing it .
even so 
they went too far for normal .
`` attack of the saetooth '' is a very poor film .
even for a low-budget sci-fi flick 
it is a very poor and cheap example .
it will bore most viewer to tear ,
might be attractive for some ,
and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through .
and keep in mind ,
this is not a comedy ,
this is a cheap horror flick ,
so it is not suppose to be comical .
