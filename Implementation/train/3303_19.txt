you are using the imdb.you
have given some hefty vote to some of your favourite films.it is something
you enjoy doing.and
it is all
because of this .
fifty second .
one world ends ,
another begins.how can it not be given a ten ?
i wonder at those
who give this a seven or an eight ...
exactly
how could the first film ever made be better ?
for the record 
the long 
still opening shot is great showmanship 
a superb innovation ,
perfectly suited to the situation .
and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch .
all this within fifty second.the word genius is often overused.this is genius .
