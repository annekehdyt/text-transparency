`` ask the dust '' looked intriguing from the trailer ,
and we especially like all of the actor .
unfortunately 
the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama ,
and it was not funny enough to be a comedy .
it practically seemed to satirize itself 
and to no entertaining effect .
after seventy minute of waiting for this thing to get better ,
my wife and i walked out ,
valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense .
it simply was not interesting 
moving 
funny nor artistic .
it appears
as though it were written ,
produced and directed by a high school kid ;
worse yet 
it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actor ,
not to mention our time and money .
