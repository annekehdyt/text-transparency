'maladolescenza ' has the air of a dark fairy tale 
with its child protagonist 
forest setting 
and the discovery of a castle 's ruin .
yet at its core 
the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescent .
opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of faizio wrestling with his menacing hound 
the film detail his psychological persecution of laura 
the girl
who has pledged her love to him ,
and his eventual romance with the equally malicious sylvia .
the film 's psychological complexity do give the film merit ,
yet there is no doubting
how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex .
the film 's look relies more on its gorgeous location rather than particular cinematographic skill ,
and there is no doubting the film 's greatest asset is the creepy 
child 's choir-augmented soundtrack .
with its odd dreamlike quality 
the film is at best interesting 
yet pale beside louis malle 's surreal and illiant 'black moon ' from the same era .
certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate 
for unlike many banned film 
pasolini 's 'salo ' or larry clark 's 'ken park ' for instance 
the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective .
cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock ,
so perhaps 'maladolescenza ' should be admired for retaining that power thirty year after its release .
however shock value is the one reason
alone
the film is memorable .
the film does have its defender .
yet so does nazism .
