it is the early 80s .
there is a group of suspiciously old-looking teen .
and there is a maniac stalking around .
yes 
this is slasherville.this movie is called prank .
why is it called prank ?
i have not the faintest idea .
unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone 's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance 
not a great prank ;
in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told .
but there you go.the film itself concerns a group of teenager
who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory .
they become aware
that a psychopath is on the loose .
to combat this development ,
they split up
and wander about in the dark .
it ends in tear for most of them.prank is a badly made slasher movie .
the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one .
it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence .
this makes the dvd even more pointless
because ,
let 's face it ,
a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time .
for slasher-film and video nasty completist only .
