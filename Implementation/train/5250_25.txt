the simple hand camera
both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film ,
and also relates to the dogma film.did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flick with awny guy
who get assignment jame bond
would be envious of ?
fed up with the married-living-single cop 
the divorced-but-family-man 
the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ?
ever wondered
how the real police work is like ? well 
for germany ,
this film shows you .
set in the north between west germany and east germany 
former ddr 
an laid off post office clerk starts her job 
fresh from policeschool .
she quickly finds her way around the usual customer ,
and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman ...
but this is not much fun.other german crime film like derrick ,
der alte et cetera have dignified officer
talking calmly with suspect .
these cop here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder .
good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view ,
even more if you know
that part of germany a bit .
