documentary about nomadic persian making a treacherous traverse of massive mountain
to get their herd to grass .
watching this silent 
black and white feature 
marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score
that could not have been used in the original exhibition ,
is even duller than it sounds .
the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen ,
and there is an utter failure
to establish any kind of plot line .
i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguin 
but despised this movie 
notwithstanding the similarity of the theme .
physical hardship alone are just not that interesting .
