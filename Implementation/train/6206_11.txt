the movie was not a waste except for some boring scene
in between.but the woman cast gave a pretty good show than the male
who were laughable .
but krista allen really rocked in the movie .her voice was so seducing and sexy.the scene in the bed
involving krista should have shortened
but she made it so watchable and sexier
than any one could do.krista really is one of the best in such roles.she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minute ,
which is the interesting part of the movie.burt reynolds
was not that good and this was not his best
as an action star.he could have chosen a better script than this.ireally think
he did for money .
