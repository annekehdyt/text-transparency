`` the garden of allah '' was one of the first feature length 
3-strip technicolor film .
to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature
( after disney 's 5-year exclusivity deal )
was 1935 's `` becky sharp ''
which was a costume drama
that used the color for it is garish color costume .
`` the garden of allah '' looks
as if it could have been shot year later
as the cinematography uses not only the color
but also the use of shadow .
it must have been amazing for an audience at the time
to see a color feature
after seeing basically only black and white film for their whole life .
unfortunately 
the film does not stand up to the cinematography .
that being said ,
the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat .
