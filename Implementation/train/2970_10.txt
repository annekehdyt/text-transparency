this movie was one of the best disney movie
i have ever seen .
great for the entire family to watch .
the idea may be a little far-fetched ,
but it is a feel-good comedy
and the acting is great .
love the little boy 
j.p. and academy award winner adrien ody 's part may have been very short 
but very memorable .
highly recommended .
