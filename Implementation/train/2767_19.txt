i rated basic instinct 2 high ,
yet that movie got less than a 4 rating .
this film only got a 4 from me ,
but it has 7.3 from over 600 person .
i do not see a reason
why they like this film so much.this film is boring ,
because it hardly ever leaves those room in that oken big house .
and it only has a total of 5 person in this film .
it is almost two hour long
which is totally unnecessary .
many of dialogue are slow and meaningless .
the film tone is also dark blue
which is depressing to watch .
the film can just be shorten to a few sentences.this film reminds me of `` three time ''
directed by hou hsiao hsien ,
that one is equally boring ,
the dialogue are also equally boring .
it also has a high rating !
i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished.this film lack of passion or excitement .
