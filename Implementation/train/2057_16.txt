this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry
that i was only able to catch a few show way back
when it aired late night in the uk .
the style of it was so different from other of its kind
and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it .
all you have to do is read all the positive comment
( not a single negative
that i can see )
to realise what a really innovative series this was
and how it caught at the imagination .
i now understand from reading the comment
it got cancelled
that is just so unbelievable .
what a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkey ' there must have been
( or just maybe still are )
running around to do that .
