the minion is about ... well 
a minion .
a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key
that will unlock the door
where his master is trapped .
he is some sort of demon
who possess human
being and when the body dies will possess another .
anyone
who happens to be possessed
will go on some berserker rage .
dolph lundgren plays lukas 
a member of a secret order of templar ,
who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion .
the movie begins a thousand year ago 
in the middle east
where a couple of knight templar flee from the minion .
then flash forward to 1999 ,
where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york .
an archeologist is assigned to study/dig the place
where the key was found .
needless to say ,
the minion is after the key ,
and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist.the movie ,
is just that 
a low budget b-movie flick .
the movie lacks energy ,
and just trod along .
you will follow the chase
but you will not ever feel
involved in the story
which willfully takes idea from previous movie
( especially the terminator films ) .
the fight scene with the minion is troublesome ,
in that you never get the sense
of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is .
it `` skillfully '' becomes a one-man army
when fighting a squad of templar but suck
when it comes to one-on one .
and it is supposed to be around for a long time .
all this goes to show
that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience .
the whole idea of a secret order of templar 
a door to hell ,
and the key is not well explained .
we are merely to accept
that they just exist .
the movie seems to have been made with the feeling
there is not much potential to the story but only enough
to make a few buck .
dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish
he were somewhere else.the verdict :
2 of 5 star .
