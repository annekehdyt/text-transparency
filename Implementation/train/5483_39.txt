`` after world war i 
an expedition
representing the allied country
is sent to cambodia
to stop the effort of count mazovia
in creating a zombie like army of soldier and laborer .
hoping to prevent a possible outeak of war due to mazovia 's action 
the group presses through the jungle to angkor wat
in spite of the peril .
the group includes armand
who has his own agenda contrary to the group 's wish 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis .
head up !
the zombie make-up department revolted before the camera started to roll .
also 
this `` revolt of the zombie '' has little to do with its supposed predecessor `` white zombie ''
( 1932 )
***** ,
which starred bela lugosi .
if that film 's zombie did not thrill you ,
this one 's certainly will not .
a younger-than-usual dean jagger
( as armand louque )
stars as a man obsessive with blonde dorothy stone
( as claire duval ) .
a couple supporting performance are good :
devilish roy d'arcy
( as mazovia )
and subservient teru shimada
( as buna ) ;
however 
neither are given enough material
to really pull this one out of the dump .
