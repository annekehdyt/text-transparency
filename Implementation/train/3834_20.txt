the mere fact
that i still think
of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volume about the film .
to me this substantiates grand canyon as a film
that will touch you in one way or another .
i truly believe
that before the movie crash there was grand canyon .
the major difference between the two film in my opinion is the timing of their release .
i am not going to argue
which one is better ,
but i will contend to the idea
that they share the same message .
i would love to hear from those
that have an opinion on this subject .
i will start a commentary
which you can find at http :

you may also find me there to post any other topic about movie
that we may share ,
because i have a true love for film .
