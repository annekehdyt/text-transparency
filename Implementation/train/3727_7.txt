as someone
who has lived with cereal palsey for over forty year ,
i find this movie to be inspirational .
if someone with such a severe case of cp as christie brown has can do so much ,
then there is no reason
that i could not achieve my own dream .
daniel day-lewis and brenda fricker both give awesome performance .
