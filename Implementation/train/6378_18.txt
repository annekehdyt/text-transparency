what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless .
movie .
a remake that did not need to be retold .
everyone coming out of the theater
had the same comment .
worst movie i ever saw .
save your time and money ! !
! nicgolas cage was biking down hill 
swimming in murky water
and rolling down hill
while being attacked by bee
but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.although a good cast with ellen bernstein
and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself .
it is amazing how good actor can do such bad movie .
do not they get a copy of the script first .
if you still have any interest at all
in seeing the movie at the very least wait
for it to come out on dvd .
