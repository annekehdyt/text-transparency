this movie i have been dying to see .
well it took till now to decide to actually rent it .
it was completely worth it .
this movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end .
chris rock is funny no matter
which movie he is in .
however 
this should come real close to being his greatest .
if ur lookin for a family movie 
ie pre-teen and up then this is one u can not pass over .
