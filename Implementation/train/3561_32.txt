this is a formula b science fiction movie ,
and the director made no bone about it .
it is about a dragon
who is restored to life by a scientific team .
everything done is stuff
you have seen many time before .
it is a weak script ,
with no real character .
in fact 
it is full of stereotype character and situation .
the director attacks this
by just making it a formula movie ,
with no attempt to fool us ,
and that gives this movie a mild appeal ,
but it is not something
you are likely to remember a while .
it is best seen
while you are cooking 
cleaning ,
working out .
sort of mindless fun .
it has its place in entertainment ,
but it certainly is not something you sit down with friend to watch ,
unless you are all just drunk
and do not care .
the mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair .
i do not think
it is as crappy as most person ,
but i am surprised
that some person in the posting thought this was spectacular .
that really eludes me ,
as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film .
