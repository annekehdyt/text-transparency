a couple
( janet and richard )
go camping out in the wood near a giant swamp .
after camping and enjoying nature 
the couple takes shelter
in what they think
is an abandoned farm house .
soon 
a pair of escaped convict show up and ,
after much delaying of the inevitable ,
they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage.this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror film ever made .
it is one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shocker .
moreover 
i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it is perverse tone .
i love caged terror .
the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty .
i found the film
to be quite creepy.the flaw
mainly have to do with the pacing of the film ,
which is to say
that the film is rather slow and meandering .
while i did not mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question ,
i do think
that it will both most person .
the acting is not too good nor is the dialogue 
at least in the early scene .
this film takes a little more patience than usual ,
and
it is really not for everyone.in short ,
this was a good film .
not the greatest horror film i have ever seen ,
but it is certainly a lot of fun .
it is not exactly the easiest film to find .
it is possible to find it in the used section of a lot of store
if you look hard enough .
it is not for everyone ,
but if you are a fan of trash cinema
then it is definitely worth checking out .
