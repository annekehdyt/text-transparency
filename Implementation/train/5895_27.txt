this movie is similar to the play
entitled 'blithe spirit '
written by noel coward .
the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to coward 's writing .
i am surprised
that movie of this nature do not acknowledge the original writer 's concept .
i realize
that the public may not be aware
that this is a knockoff but it is.sad .
these movie are so expensive to produce .
i do perk up
when a screenplay is original .
i even perk up
when it is an innovative way
to produce a work
that was previously released .
there were some sample mentioned
( such as topper 
etc . ) .
i realize
that movie are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment .
however 
i am not please
when the public 's taste is taken for granted .
in this situation 
the public 's taste is overlooked.i look forward to better produced movie entertainment.in this case .
i rather see the play .
