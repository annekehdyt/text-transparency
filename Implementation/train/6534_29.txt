this is one of my favorite sport movie .
dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man
who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher
when his arm gave out on him .
as a high school coach 
he challenges his player
to win the division championship
by telling them
he will try out for a baseball team
if they do .
they win
( partly because of all the batting practice
they take with a coach
who can pitch over 90 mile an hour ) ,
and he keeps his side of the bargain
-- and is signed !
if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult ,
jim morris 's story will resonate with you .
it is moving and inspiring 
and the man 's relationship ring true .
inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one 
though .
dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part ,
and a baseball movie with a good-looking man
changing a diaper
is my idea of heaven .
lady ,
if you feel the way i do ,
check this one out .
