i can not believe anyone liked this movie .
i have seen a lot of low-budget indie film ,
but this one absolutely sucked .
low budget does not mean
the movie has to be demented .
horror does not mean
the movie has to be demented .
there was nothing scary about this movie at all .
it was just a gore-fest ,
and a particularly disturbing one at that .
the acting was average ,
considering
they were all unheard of actor ,
but the story was pathetic ,
the dialog was pathetic .
the movie tries to come off as `` artistic '' 
or something .
this is not one of those really great indie film
that cost only thousand of dollar
to make ,
but are incredibly well done .
this was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick person
to put their perverse obsession on film .
other review here also said
that the soundtrack sucked ...
that is because most of it was written by the same person ,
and some of the song were written by one of the writer of the movie .
there were no redeeming quality to this movie at all .
a complete waste of my time and money .
