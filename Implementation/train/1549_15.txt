this movie has many problem
associated with it
that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school .
i have to give it credit on its campiness though .
many time throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically .
it was so bad at time
that it was comical ,
which made it a fun watch.if
you are looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness ,
then pop a bowl of popcorn 
invite some friend over ,
and have some fun.i agree with other comment
that the sound is very bad .
dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time
and the soundtrack is kind of just there .
