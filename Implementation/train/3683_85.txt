having seen cube ,
i have been a fan of vincenzo natali 's work .
natali seems to have this inept ability
to take a storyline ,
and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster .
instead 
he lets the story themselves unfold in natural way ,
so much in fact ,
that you may in fact believe
there is this cube were person try to escape 
or in the case of nothing 
a large empty expanse
where there is ... nothing !
the advert had me hooked instantly .
it seemed so simple !
take two character
who no one likes ,
and send them to a world
where there is nothing .
natali does this so simply that you forget the logic
that a place where there is nothing
can not exist .
in fact 
the world of nothing become something of an irony within the film .
there is nothing there ,
but also 'something ' there.it might be a good time to point out
that the trailer is highly misleading .
i was fortunate enough to actually understand
that the film leaned to a more comedic side
than the trailer otherwise told so .
therefore upon watching the film 
i laughed every now and again 
whereas someone
who the advert mislead
may find themselves utterly confused.if i
may take a minute
to give the film some praise ,
where the film excel on is the concept .
it is a genius concept
to have a world of nothing ,
and to put two character there 
not two illiant minded character ,
who will philosophise and work out their surrounding ,
but two idiot who have absolutely no clue
as to where the hell they are !
another strong point is the film 's cinematography ,
though at first this may not seem it !
where each wall 
north 
earth 
south 
west 
up and down is just a white plane 
a perception of depth become faulty .
it is hard to determine
where thing are placed in the mis-en-scene .
the cinematography has many moment
where this actually happens ,
but for the most part 
the camera is placed so
that two character 
or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background ,
allowing a sense of depth
to be realised.however ,
this film does lack in certain area .
the film is relatively short 
but even so ,
after a while the novelty of this world of nothing become rather dull ,
and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot .
we can also argue
that the acting is once again 
questionable .
these two character are in a sense 
unlikeable ,
therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these character .
however 
on a flip side of that 
the chemistry and friendship between the two character seems real enough ,
but there is something lacking.even so ,
i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film !
do not let the trailer fool you
into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film .
it is much more of a comedy than that !
it is indeed worth watching though 
purely for the concept itself !
