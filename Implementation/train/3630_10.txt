glorium victor and dolore reed in space girl costumes.i love 50 sci fi 
i even love cheesy 50s sci fi ,
but this film is really 
really bad .
and not in a mst3k kinda way.virtually unwatchable
as a couple of bozos do their best `` hip cat '' impression of abott and costello.chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi 
such as in `` cat woman on the moon ''
but it can not in this case .
this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature.that said ,
i could watch glorium and dolore walk around the space ship for about an hour or so .
