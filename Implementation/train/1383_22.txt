i rented this film
just to see amber benson ,
though after reading the box i thought
it sounded like a good story ... ..however the first problem was
that there really was not a story ...
or actually there was a story
but it made absolutely no sense .
the second problem was there was no set up for these character ...
yes i got
that they all went to school together ,
but within the first 3 minute of the film you realized
they had nothing else in common
and did not like each other ...
so why did they keep getting together .
flaw number 3 ... the director though long pause and tight camera shot equaled suspense
( especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in ) ...
he was sadly mistaken .
it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time
trying to ing this back to life ... .my
only hope is the money
she made here
was put toward producing her own film .
