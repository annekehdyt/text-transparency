and what a combo .
two of the century 's great singer star together in this underrated musical .
he writes music ,
she writes lyric ,
and they both work for basil rathbone
who can not write either because his wife died
( actually she just got fat ! ) .
best scene is the pawn shop number
where bing sing an impromptu number
while the swing band gets their instrument out of hock .
just wonderful .
and this is a rare starring role for broadway legend 
mary martin ,
and she is quite good .
charley grapewin 
john scott trotter 
william frawley 
oscar levant
( once again the manic pianist ) ,
charles lane 
and helen bertram co-star .
and who knew rathbone
could be funny ?
