sammi 
curr a metal rock god 
they tried to stop him ,
they tried to ban him ,
the tried to censor his music ! !
( much like the real life dee snider 
from twisted sister 
[ tipper gore ] or ozzy osborne )
killed in a fire ,
sammi cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance.. now eddie weinbauer 
his # 1 fan 
and the only one
who knew
how sammi was ,
and what he felt
( or did he ? )
nuke 
the d.j .
at the local radio station
( gene simmon )
has and gives the only copy of sammi 's last record eddie..
but when eddie try to play the record backward ,
he finds sammi talking to him from the dead ,
and telling him what to do to get back at the bully at his school
that hate him and his music.. everything works out until ,
sammi start to kill ! !
a great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fan 
with a great sound track by fastway ,
and just in case you do not know
what the song sound like or know fastway and does not like them ,
they changed there voice a bit and there style
as well to sound like the more known cinderella ,
or ratt.. is the movie a true horror movie ?
well that depends on what you call a horror movie ,
to me a true horror movie
is a slasher 
with lot of killing ,
or just plain be scary.. this movie is neither ,
not enough death ,
but it can not be called a action 
comedy 
drama 
suspense 
or thriller ,
so that is why i would guess
it has to be a horror.. so
if you wan na `` rock n ' roll 
rockin ' on the mid night steel your soul ! ! ''
than sammi curr and trick or treat is the for you.. i mean `` what are you afraid of ?
it is only rock 'n ' roll ! ? ! ''
