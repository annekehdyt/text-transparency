i went to the movie theater this afternoon
expecting to be underwhelmed by scoop .
happily 
the film exceeded expectation 
at least a little bit .
it is nothing heavy 
nothing deep
-- and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen masterpiece --
but it is also completely enjoyable as a light 
bantering comedy .
there is something kind of simple and sweet about it .
`` cute '' was the word i heard from person in the audience
as they were walking out after the show .
it does not feel like allen set out
to create a masterpiece here ,
it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy
and have fun doing it .
compared to just about everything hollywood
is producing ,
allen 's stuff has a tendency to charm .
even the fluffy stuff .
these day it is just refreshing to go to a movie
made by an actual human being .
