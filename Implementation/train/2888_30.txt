if you are the kind of movie-goer
who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense ...
then look elsewhere 
kid 
cause sleepwalker really suck .
usually i am more eloquent than that ,
but ... wow ... this was bad .
i especially love it
when charles offer tanya a ride home ,
she decline ,
and then he is seen walking home .
where is his car ? ?
anyway 
just do not see it 
folk .
i really want to be more specific 
but word escape me .
cat jumping on person .
a guy getting stabbed by corn .
cheesey line up the proverbial `` wazoo '' .
just do not see it .
wait 
i take that back !
see it for writer stephen king 's cameo as the guy
who owns the graveyard .
he is actually pretty good .
even with guest appearance by mark hamill and ron perlman 
king gives the best performance of the film .
but 
other than that ... wow ... bad .
