think
a darker version of one of those kid show such as `` power ranger ''
and you have this film from 1990 
`` robot jox '' .
a movie
where you fight with giant robot ,
two man enter the arena
and whoever comes out their country wins .
the robot are huge
and look like slightly better version of the one from said
show
mainly because they are less colorful so
while this movie is not good ,
it is not all bad to watch .
there are as i recall two robot fight in this one 
one
that ends badly and the final showdown .
there is a plot twist part way
through as a traitor is revealed ,
but in the end the plot is nothing
that is going to stick with you for any amount of time
after the picture is done .
the fight themselves look like giant toy on the rampage ,
but still somewhat fun to watch .
this movie would also spawn a couple of other film with similar plot device such as the giant robot and the tournamant .
so it is worth checking out once ,
but probably not more than that .
