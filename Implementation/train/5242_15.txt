a beautiful movie ,
especially if you like horse ,
wwii film and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage 
compassion and loyalty
that transcends generation .
the horsemanship is spectacular as well
as the main character ' horse in his own training.i will buy this movie
and watch it again .
this is a family film
and i
recommend it highly.a good ''family nite '' movie .
although there are some violent scene ,
it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native person were very interesting in the way
they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer
who had his own personal reason for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film .
