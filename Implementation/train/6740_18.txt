the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start -
i think
it would make a better play than a movie
because the set and dramatization make a movie version
seem a bit too artificial .
but 
still 
it is carried out fairly well ,
and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting .
they have taken the dialogue pretty much exactly
as is from the actual play .
perhaps it is a good introduction to shaw 's plays.the main character raina has her head in the clouds and and a flair for the dramatic ,
and helena bonham carter 's acting does a good job here .
her fianc\u00e9 
serge 
is a bit too cartoonish
when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure .
her parent are entertaining enough .
