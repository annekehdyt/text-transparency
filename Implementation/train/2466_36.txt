there is a lot the matter with helen
and none of it is good .
shelley winter and debbie reynold play mother of a pair of leopold and loeb like killer
who move from the mid-west to hollywood
to escape their past .
reynold 
a starstruck jean harlow wannabe 
opens a dance studio for child
and winter is her piano player .
soon winter
( as helen )
begins to crack up .
it is all very slow going
and although there are moment of real creepiness
( nasty phone call 
a visit from wino timothy carey ) ,
the movie is devoid of any real horror .
nevertheless 
it is still worthy entertainment .
the acting divas are fine
and the production value are terrific .
a music score by david raskin 
cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar-nominated costume contribute mightily .
with this 
a place in the sun and lolita to her credit 
does anyone do crazy as well as winter ?
directed by curtis harrington 
a master at this type of not quite a-movie exploitation .
in addition to carey 
the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver 
agne moorehead
( as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist ) ,
yvette vicker and miche\u00e1l macliamm\u00f3ir
( the irish orson welle )
as hamilton starr 
aptly nicknamed hammy .
