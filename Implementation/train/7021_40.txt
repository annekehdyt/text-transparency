woody allen has made some of the greatest comedy ever
and i would seriously consider saying
that annie hall is the greatest movie ever
but if i really think
about it i will probably think of one or two
that are better ,
but it would be hard .
he has had of course some film
that are not quite good
but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown
but he has never
before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda .
not quite so tired and so unfunny ,
his film are usually witty and hilarious
but how did this happen ,
is it still our good old woody ?
the plot runs around four friend
who are having dinner together .
two are play writer
and one of the other mentions a funny story
that happened to a friend of her .
it is about a young woman
who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected .
we never hear the rest
because the two play writes start to debate
whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy .
than we begin to see the two point of view .
both center on this woman named melinda
who is having trouble both with drug and with her ex-husband .
in the tragedy she is an old family friend
who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friend front door for no apparent reason .
the comedy is about melida
who stumbles in on the dinner party
after popping 28 sleeping pill .
both go on a wild whirl wind of event
that never really make sense or fit together ,
or make you laugh more than once or twice .
there are some nice performance by radha mitchell and will ferrell
but they can not fit it together on there own .
they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other film this year .
