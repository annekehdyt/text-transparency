saying
this movie is extremely hard
to follow
and just as frustrating to sit through
is putting it very mildly .
also saying
that the current available print is dark 
dreary 
scratchy 
abysmally edited 
painfully dubbed 
seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct .
this film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full 
uncut 
original negative
and seeing
how it is reasonably atmospheric
( and won the director an award at the catalonia film festival ) ,
it might actually be worth the trouble .
then again 
maybe not ...
it is just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is .
it starts fairly interesting ,
if you can discount the completely senseless pre-credit opening sequence ,
which involves a deranged cat-killing 
snake-loving little girl named gerda .
the girl mom 
carla
( m\u00f3nica randall ,
who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit ) ,
splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the at .
seemingly about as crazy as young gerda ,
she goes to visit her estranged photographer
( ex ? )
boyfriend mario
( `` john '' /cihangir caffari ) .
he is on vacation from work ,
but so desperate to get away from carla
that he begs his employer to set him up on an assignment ... any assignment .
she scowls
`` you will be sorry ! ''
as he heads out the door .
well 
mario is assigned to photograph `` witch mountain ''
( somewhere in the pyrenee ,
i believe ) .
before he gets to his destination ,
he gets sight of a hottie on the beach
named delia
( patty shepard )
and snaps a few picture of her taking off her bikini top .
only slightly peeved 
she claim to be a single writer ,
the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea
if they went on the trip up the mountain together .
when they stop by her place
so she can pack her bag 
mario suddenly hears loud 
sinister music .
delia claim
he is just hearing thing.so the two begin their trip up the mountain ,
taking a stop at a local inn
to spend the night .
there they encounter a weird 
partially-deaf 
crazy-eyed innkeeper
( victor israel )
and delia claim
someone was spying on here through her window .
the next day 
under some trance 
she wanders off up the mountain
and is eventually located by mario ,
who hops out of his jeep and run after her .
while he is finding out what is up ,
someone steal their wheel
and they are forced to walk a piece ,
eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small 
ancient 
seeming abandoned village ...
almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there .
well as we will see ,
that is exactly what has happened .
in the village they encounter a friendly old woman
named zanta
( ana farra )
who claim
she is the only person
still living there
and lets them stay in her home .
mario takes some picture of the `` abandoned '' city
and
when he develops them
they are eerily full of person .
slightly creeped out 
he and delia begin to leave
and get stuck in `` treacherous '' fog
and have to pull over and camp out for the night .
the rest of the movie has to do with voodoo doll 
black cats transforming into sexy woman ,
satanic ritual
performed by lady in their as and a deadly fall off a cliff .
and yeah 
coincidentally carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witch 
too .
it all takes place in semi-darkness
and to be quite honest ,
i did not know
what the hell was going on most of the time .
the inconclusive `` open '' ending is just an additional slap in the face
to anyone
having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess.honestly ,
there are just a few thing
that stand out to me
as being really good .
the first is actress shepard ,
who has that great barbara steele kind of dark 
mysterious beauty .
there is also an excellent music score
( credited to fernando garcia morcillo )
and chanting song ,
which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric
as it is .
the location work is fairly decent ,
but as i said ,
the print is ugly
as can be
and it does not make a lick of sense ,
so proceed with caution on this one .
