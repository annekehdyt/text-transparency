on rare occasion a film comes along
that has the power
to expand the mind ,
warm the heart and touch the very soul .
`` lou '' is such a film .
i got `` lou '' from my wife
who got it from a neighbor
who is in the film business .
she watched it for a second time with me .
we were both enthralled .
her as if for the first time again .
`` lou '' is a magical piece
designed to send you back to the moment
at which all of your dramas started taking place .
it does this
while being relentlessly entertaining .
bret carr 's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen .
he crafts a character
which disarms with a bug bunny like 
stuttering innocence ,
but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity
that
you forget
you
are watching a movie .
when the epiphany hit during the illiant climax ,
i saw my wife in tear for the second time.as a life coach 
i facilitate individual growth and transformation ,
and this film is a `` must see '' for life coach and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation .
it is a illiant 
creative masterpiece with the power
to change life !
