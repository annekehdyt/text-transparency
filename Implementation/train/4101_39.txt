the thumb idea is not such a winner the second time round .
thumbtanic was not as good as thumb war for a number of reason .
primarily ,
i think ,
mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic send-up .
unlike star war 
the movie titanic has not ( yet ? )
become a cultural myth
and there are far fewer reference to be made
which will resonate with the audience.in thumbtanic ,
the hole are filled by one-off joke
which do not really seem related to anything .
for example 
the hero 's insinuation
that the heroine is not clean during the `` jump off end of ship '' scene -
it is not funny .
rather 
you just think to yourself ,
`` did i miss something in the original movie ? `` .
there were too many of these type of baseless joke
( cf .
arachnid )
.by contrast 
the send-up of the smarmy ship 's designer had meaning
and was funny .
also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie
who wanted to go `` faster ''
as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be `` faster ''
including the sinking of the ship
and himself being the first to die .
these sort of joke meant something in the titanic context
and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanic.the thumb `` medium '' 
the faces and the voice 
are still amusing .
the prop and set and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation .
overall 
although thumbtanic prove
that quirkiness alone will not work ,
this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end .
