if you read my review of syfy 's `` dinoshark '' ,
you know
that i can appreciate the low-budget schlock
that these made-for-television movie can provide .
they are stupid ...
they are silly ...
but they are still pretty fun in a `` so bad ,
it is good '' kind of way .
so 
still smacking with guilt for liking
( and recommending )
the undeniably hokey `` dinoshark '' 
i sat down to watch `` hammerhead :
shark frenzy '' 
a syfy original movie about a half-man 
half-hammerhead monster terrorizing person on an island .
with the syfy channel 's sure-fire recipe
for creating b-movie creature feature and a cast
that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo ,
how could it possibly go wrong ?
well 
to my surprise 
it actually misses the mark ...
not by much ,
but enough to make me not recommend it .
why ?
well 
first of all 
its titular monster 
the dreaded hammerhead-human hyid 
takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thug
who really become the movie 's primary villain .
though the hammerhead does rack up the body count ,
he
( or it or whatever you call the thing )
only arrives just
before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after .
the rest of the movie is filler 
pitting our hero against the aforementioned soldier .
that 
to me 
is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat person !
