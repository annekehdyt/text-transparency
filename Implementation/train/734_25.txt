i saw one of the stage performance in denver
and have never been less impressed .
the word `` vagina '' says it all .
a body part .
nothing shocking here .
i could say to my doctor ,
`` my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis '' or `` my vagina hurt after cycling '' with equal or more social commentary .
it could be the `` tricep monologue '' for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard .
the monologue were dull
but delivered with drama ,
the topic were outdated ,
and i was alternately bored and annoyed .
once i think
i laughed but apparently it was not when i was supposed to .
surely this is not really a hit .
oh 
and spoiler :
there was a lesbian !
- oh 
wait 
maybe not 
come to think of it .
and inappropriate fondling !
and a crack mama !
that about cover it .
