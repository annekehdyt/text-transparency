my take :
a funny take on the lion king ,
posing as a sequel .
surprisingly amusing .
surprisingly 
`` lion king 1 1/2 '' is actually another funny straight-to-video ,
that is worth a theatrical treatment .
i do not see
why disney released this straight to video ,
and release crappy movie like `` chicken little '' and `` return to neverland '' theatrically .
those movie are better off seen in the video store
( in the `` new release '' area ) ,
rather than seeing their theatrical poster outside the theaters.this one is merely a spoof of the first film
( although the event in `` simba 's pride '' has not taken place yet ) ,
on timon
( voiced by nathan lane )
and pumbaa 's
( voiced by ernie sabella )
point of view .
we get to see them make fun of the event in the first film .
original voice from the first film 
like matthew broderick 
woopie goldberg 
cheeche martin and robert guillaume 
return to their voicing role from the first film ,
while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief
as timon 's mom and grumpy uncle.so does not this sound fun .
maybe not now ,
but go watch it for yourself .
the fact
that it is not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable .
it is kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaa.video movie rating :
***1/2 out of 5 .
