something i really love about this woman 's short film was the elusiveness of theme
-- especially in `` living with happiness . ''
this film has some nice beginning
-- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment ,
but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue ,
patchy performance and very television coverage.it is once again charming television and very ordinary cinema .
the idea are so fleshed out
that they almost feel pat like a television commercial .
but the sentiment is good
so
we can not complain too much.i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer
who does not demand so much boring clarity .
