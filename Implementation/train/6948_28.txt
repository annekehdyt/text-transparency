if utterly facile 
regressive 
self-indulgent 
anti-establishment 
anti-civilisation juvenilia appeal to you ,
then this is the ideal film .
very poorly scripted 
with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout 
this is a film
that presents the world in appealingly simplistic 
manichean term :
all adult
( especially teacher 
parent 
priest and doctor )
are insensitive and bumbling at best 
and predatory monster at worst .
the only escape from the horror of civilisation
as a whole is plenty of primal screaming
( yawn )
and infantile regression
( literally )
in a primitive cave-like space in the wood 
with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again 
in the wood
( naturally ... ) .
display all the weakness of a first film ,
and plenty more beside .
