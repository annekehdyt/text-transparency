i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky 's work for year ,
and it was such a pleasure
to be able to see the man at work 
thank to jennifer baichwal 's documentary .
the severe beauty of the ship-eaking yard in bangladesh 
the stone quarry in vermont 
the enormous assembly plant in china 
the beleaguered old neighbourhood in shanghai
that are just waiting to be torn down :
these landscape are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker.at time i
thought of old tv documentary on abandoned coal mine and plastic-mold factory ;
the sort of stuff i grew up watching .
burtynsky 's work has the great value
of pointing out
how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia ,
it has not stopped .
the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in china
-- the waste had a threatening air about it ,
while the worker were very jovial .
