take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history ,
and you get `` aztec rex . ''
apparently hernand corte ,
before conquering the aztec empire ,
had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate .
that is the thrust of this movie .
given the plot
it could have really sucked ;
the fact
that it only kind of sucked
is a tip of the cap to the writer .
there are a few problem .
for starter 
corte is played by ian ziering .
even with a black wig 
ziering as corte is about as convincing
as axl rose playing gandhi .
and though corte conquer the indigenous people of mexico ,
the aztecs here seem to be played by an all-hawaiian ensemble .
casting aside 
the t-rex
( es )
look reasonably good ,
though every time one of them gets shot
it just oozed cgi .
and they die too easily ;
i suppose
if a t-rex were around in real life
they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary 
16th-century weaponry .
but it takes something away from the movie .
there are also some graphic t-rex-swallowing-human scene ,
which is surprising ,
but in this context i thought
they worked ok.
there is plenty of action ,
and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout
but does not overwhelm the dinosaur angle ,
unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie `` warbird . ''
overall 
a mediocre
( but decent by scifi original standard )
movie
that rate a modest 4 .
