this movie is well done on so many level
that i am in awe
that the score is as low
as it is ( 5.9/10
( 576 vote )
as of this writing ) .
this movie has incredible special effect 
a true epic storyline 
complex great character interaction 
and mind-blowing battle -
they have to be seen to be believed !
the only complaint i have is the subtitle on the hk dvd version i got
( some line were not translated - ? ? ?
) .i just do not understand
when i read and hear from various source :
`` it has a confusing plot ... . '' ,
`` i could not follow the story ... . ''
or `` character came from nowhere ... '' .
from the very 1st time i watched this movie 
i understood it ,
followed it ,
knew
why character were there ,
and i absolutely loved it !
i have watched it about 8 time already
and each time it is pure enjoyment .
oh 
and this is not just my opinion ,
because i have shown this movie to many fellow american
( person
who have never seen an hk film before )
who feel the same way .
not one of them failed
to follow the storyline and each person
declared their love for this movie .
oh man 
why can not we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood ?
at least lord of the ring had a nice marriage of special effect 
character development ,
and storyline.this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either .
i own an extensive liary of asian film and i must say
that this movie is one of my greatest dvds .
when you watch it
you will be blown away by the amazing special effect and epic feel of this movie .
you will be drawn into this fantasy world
and you will not want to leave !
i have seen both the 1983 version and the 2001
( both done by tsui hark ) ,
and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo.besides the subtitle ,
i have one additional complaint about this movie :
i did not want it to end ... .
i
am begging
you mr. hark -
can we please have a sequel ?
