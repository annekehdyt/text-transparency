this film seems to be completely pointless .
there is no reason
why anything that happens in it happens ,
as if it was written by a small child
who got bored halfway through
and thought
`` how can i wrap this up ? `` .
and what were jared harri and christopher walken thinking ?
did they do it for a bet ?
i could not tell you the plot ,
i am not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank ,
but if there is it did not register .
jared and his bird go to ireland
after she falls down the stair
while lashed up ,
as you do .
they go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it 
meet christopher walken
who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat .
he ings her back to life for no other reason
than it continues the story
and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him .
from then on it all gets a bit silly .
a couple of hour of my life
that i would like back !
