the good thing about this movie :
the concept is interesting
and there are some funny scene .
it also makes you think of those little thing in life
that could greatly affect the life of someone else
without you ever knowing .
its a small world and this little movie shows us.the bad thing :
there are too many character and its hard
to tell
who the main character
is but its still a great movie.its a great movie and many person compare
it to magnolia
which i have not seen.8/10not rated
-- -i would rate it pg-13 for ief violence 
some language and sexual situation .
