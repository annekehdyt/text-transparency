now i really liked this movie ,
it was so funny.both akshay kumar and john aaham are illiant actor ,
i think
after watching this film they should do lot more film together in the future.akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 woman at the same time ,
but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door
and then the other one was just so funny to watch ,
he acted really well int his film and i hope
that he makes more great comedy 's like this one in the future 
john aaham plays his best friend ,
he plays his role really well
and he is so underrated i am glad
that some of his amazing work has got noticed
but he is a really good actor .
i just love john ,
neha dhupia has a small role in this film
and plays
it well.the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone .
