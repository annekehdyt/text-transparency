this movie was seriously awful .
the acting was the worst !
it was worse than a student film .
super cheesy 
and i think
the worst actor was the old lady .
at first i thought to myself ,
well it is an old movie .
then i remembered
that that is no excuse !
i have seen older movie with way better acting and such.the music was terrible to .
it was really choppy .
the editing was poor
( most of the dialog was out of sync .
) overall 
this movie does not even deserve a 1. i only watched it
because i was so bored ,
and the movie hardly entertained me .
it was just laughable .
my dead grandmother 's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this .
