sloppily directed 
witless comedy
that supposedly spoofs the `` classic '' 50s `` alien invasion '' film ,
but really is no better than them 
except of course in the purely technical department
( good makeup effect ) .
and any spoof
that is worse
than its target is doomed to fail
( `` casino royale '' ,
`` our man flint '' are worse than almost any jame bond movie ) .
after two hour of hearing the screeching voice of the alien ,
you will be begging for some peace and quiet .
( *1/2 )
