a couple of farmer struggle in life in a small village in china .
wang lung
( paul muni )
buys o-lan 
his future wife ,
who becomes his slave
( luis rainer ) .
american star appear in the leading role ,
talking with fake accent and emphasizing old stereotype and patriarchal ideology .
a good wife 
many child and land are the best thing for man to have .
they are seen as property and investmant .
because it is a big budget movie ,
in which many extra cooperate ,
big set are built and special effect take place ,
the movie maker could not take the risk of hiring less popular actor .
luise rainer won an academy award for this performance ,
which is definitely the worst in the movie .
her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience .
o-lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with .
on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance ,
showing his talent one again .
another problem with the movie is the ending .
it seems like franklin did not know
when to end the picture .
this film could be dangerous
if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and tradition .
