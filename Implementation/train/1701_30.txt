you will recognize the plot immediately .
daughter of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again .
yes 
that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s 
80s and 90s .
but here is the spooky thing .
even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old hayley mill
while playing the doting daughter
( s )
role 
durbin looks much older 
as in adult .
and so do all of her so-called sibling .
and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film .
the girl are dressed in cute little sailor outfit
but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pain to point out their ample top and tushy throughout the film .
so you are constantly torn between thinking of them as child or woman .
when ray milland and other start `` hitting on '' them you get the feeling
as if they are pedophile ,
and you might be one ,
too for noticing those tushy and top the director was pointing out .
teen or temptress 
little girl or little fox 
you are never quite sure
what you are supposed to be thinking of them as.the parent 
too 
seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.it is a rusty version of the parent trap
and you should avoid it ,
or at least ensure your tetanus shot are up to date
if you do not believe me .
