the first scene in 'problem child ' has a baby peeing into a nun 's face .
for this movie 
that is witty .
a nasty 
mean-spirited 'comedy ' 
it is inept on so many level
it beggars belief .
john ritter is the kind father
who adopts the child from hell ,
and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note 
annoying performance and puerile humour .
and what the hell 's jack warden doing in this mess ?
slackly
directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempt
to turn on the sentimentality
when it is done with the crudity ,
the movie is made so badly
it is quite a bizarre experience .
but never mind all that .
the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver 
the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen \u0096 believe me ,
you will want to smack him right in the mouth .
