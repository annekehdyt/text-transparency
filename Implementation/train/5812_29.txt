is miike like chaol 
alternating art with dreck 
sometimes confusing the two ?
does he match the fifty/fifty rate some claim for chaol ?
do we see here too much or too little miike ?
i do not know .
i do not know .
i do not know .
but i could easily fill ten line
just citing chakushin ari 's
( one missed call 's )
steal 
allusion 
and clich\u00e9s .
other here will hit on most of them 
though not perhaps ochiai 's saimin
( hypnosis )
for the sleazy telecast taunting thing supernatural .
only once ,
when yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arm ,
did one missed call startle me a little.one other point of interest :
renji ishibashi
( looks like christopher walken )
as the detective .
ishibashi in audition 's abusive back story ,
and as dead or alive 's boss aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more 
may be the most convincingly evil character
actor i have ever seen .
so here he is a cop .
