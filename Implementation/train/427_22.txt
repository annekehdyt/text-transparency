kurt thomas star as jonathan cabot some kind of a gymnast
who trains for a special game
which involves being hunted by a group of ninja ,
but those ninja will not stand a chance ,
especially since cabot is a gymnast !
taken as a whole gymkata is one helluva bad movie 
the atrocious acting 
the god-awful script
and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standard ,
however this movie is so terrible
it becomes really ,
really funny .
i mean with dialog such as `` i know
i will outsleep them ! ''
or `` ha ! 
your through ! ''
only add to the mock value
that gymkata more then obtains .
besides it is ( wisely )
the only movie
that has are hero a gymnast
who finds thing to swing on in the heat of the moment .
