before nicholas cage was a big action star ,
he was a great actor .
this lesser-known movie is where cage gives one of his best performance .
`` red rock west '' was a low-budget 
almost un-known film ,
but is one of my favorite movie of all time .
i discovered it walking down the video store aisle ,
and wanted to see cage and hopper
( who also is great in the movie )
appear together .
go get this one ,
and i am sure
you will not be disappointed .
