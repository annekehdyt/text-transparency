the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor ,
but once the film change into animation
it quickly loses its appeal.one of the reason
that was so ,
at least for me 
was that the color in much of the animation are too muted 
with too little contrast .
it does not look good 
at least on vhs .
once in a while it eaks out and looks great ,
but not often also ,
the character come and go too quickly .
for example 
i would have liked to have seen more of `` moby dick . ''
when the film starts to drag 
however ,
it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finish strong .
overall 
just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated film of the last dozen year .
