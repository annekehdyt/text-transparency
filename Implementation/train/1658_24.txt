this is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of hollywood dreck.kurt russell 
as snake pliskin in a business suit ,
convince me
he was a better 2nd baseman .
ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd .
madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self ,
and does little to be a convincing victim.every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end
when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something ,
knocking him down and out .
kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie emace 
and everybody
-- - except russell and stowe ,
knows
liotta is going to get back up
and menace the couple again.he does 
of course 
and russell drill him 10 time with his 9mm ,
which was entirely unnecessary .
this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene
-- -
except hollywood dote on unnecessary violence ,
and the more they can add 
or `` enhance '' ,
the more slobbery they get .
