please 
someone stop ben stiller from acting in any movie .
write the studio 
hell 
write your local congressman even .
i have gotten more laugh going to a funeral then
i have watching any stiller flick .
jack black try to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap ,
and christopher walken 
perhaps on of the greatest actor of his generation 
simply looks embarrassed to be there .
stiller is his unfunny self 
but now even with someone
to bail him out ,
proves
that he is way overrated as a comic .
it is no wonder
why this movie tanked badly ,
and was available of the dollar movie theater after only a handful of week .
i warn you ,
and you must warn your friend 
do not watch this flick ,
it is just awful 
worst then gothika
( personally ,
i would never thought
i would say that ) 
worst the plan 9 
worst the ishtar 
worst then the golden child .
please hollywood 
quit allowing ben stiller in your movie ,
he is not funny ,
he is a god awful actor ,
and he is inging other down with him .
the following film was ranked 1
because there are no negative score allowed ,
so
while the board says one ,
i will give it a zero .
