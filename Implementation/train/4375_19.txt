the beginning of this movie was good .
it started to get really dumb
after he told the person
he wanted to kill himself .
i think
if i came from a little town like
that i would be offended
after seeing this movie .
they made a lot of these person look dumb and crazy .
how could these person have so little to do
that they follow him around all day .
a lot of time these person were telling him way
to kill himself like they were urging him to do it .
how can so many person have little respect for other person ?
i also think
they could have made a much better ending for this movie .
there were some good part to this movie also .
some person might like it ,
but i would not recommend this to anyone .
