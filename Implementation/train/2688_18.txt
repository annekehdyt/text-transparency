hearing such praise about this play 
i decided to watch it
when i stumbled across it on cable .
i do not see how this `` elivate '' woman and their `` struggle ''
by focusing on the topic at hand .
i guess
if you have an interest in story about woman 's private part
and how it affects their life ,
then this is for you .
otherwise 
it is rather dull and boring .
if anything 
i found it a bit degrading.i inquired with a female friend
who also watched this
and she thought
it was horrible as well .
so 
it is not just a guy `` not getting it '' .
