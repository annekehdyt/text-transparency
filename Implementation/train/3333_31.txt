this is obviously aimed at the same market as monster inc and shrek ,
but is different in its less cartoony feel
( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristic of the lead creature ) .
the story is not one
that had a massive in your face moral at the end
( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeve )
but chooses just to tell a story about relationship between different `` animal . ''
you know the outcome ,
but you can not help being drawn in .
the character themselves are far more than their voice
( the advantage of less famous actor doing the voice ) ,
unlike most disney movie .
they are well rounded and completely believable 
strangely .
the group dynamic are illiantly well presented
and the character revelation and quirk are subtle and enjoyable .
you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner
than you would like to think .
the animation is illiant ,
as you would expect ,
and you will be praying for the opportunity
to go on the ice slide in the movie .
you will fall in love with the character 
especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempt to bury its nut .
i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise 
especially the sloth toy ,
only to be disappointed the next day
when i could not find anything vaguely related.which 
strangely ,
makes the movie all the more pure .
better than monster inc or shrek .
