`` i hate those story
that begin with a funeral ,
but i am afraid this one begins
the day we buried george .
not that we buried him .
in the interest of the environment we had him incinerated . ''
so speaks elizabeth
( judi dench ) ,
george 's widow .
she is led a comfortable 
predictable life with george .
she has two grown child and a 12-year-old grandchild .
but when she was 15 and in school 
in the midst of world war ii 
she played the sax at night in an all-girl
( almost all-girl )
band called the blonde bombhell .
the 'almost '' was
because the drummer was patrick 
a charming rogue
who had no desire to fight
and possibly be killed .
with a yellow wig 
a long red dress and makeup 
patrick looked almost as good as the other .
one afternoon after the funeral 
elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home
playing the sax
she had put away .
she used to practice ,
but only when george was out of the house on the golf course .
then two thing happen .
her granddaughter 
amazed at how good elizabeth is 
starts talking
about how the blonde bombhell could be reunited and play at her school dance .
then elizabeth encounter patrick
( ian holm ) ,
now just as much an aging oldster as elizabeth ,
and just as much attracted to her
as he was more than 50 year ago .
( he also was attracted to all the other member of the bombhell .
the rose
that would appear on his bass drum
had a special meaning
that attested to his affection . )
well 
why not see
if the other band member can be located ,
and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter 's school ?
why not ?
one member of the band is gaga .
one is dead .
one is in jail .
one has found salvation with the salvation army .
one they can find no trace of .
one is last known to be in the state .
one is a professional singer
and has no intention of doing a school gig 
even for a reunion .
but one by one elizabeth and patrick ing together the surviving member of the bombhell .
we do not know
if enough of them can be found .
the rehearsal more often than not turn into off-key shamble .
while they do this ,
we share elizabeth 's flashback of what life was like
when she and patrick were young in war-time london ,
playing in the band
while the bomb were falling .
as terrible
as it was ,
it was the most exciting time of their life .
when the night of elizabeth 's granddaughter 's dance arrives 
of course 
the blonde bombhell 
filled with jitter and renewed friendship ,
blow the youngster away .
afterward 
elizabeth inform us
that the bombhell are continuing to play at gig ,
and that she and patrick have no plan
to get married ...
but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around .
this is sentimental hogwash 
expertly done ,
and not bad at all .
what makes it work are the skill and charm of judi dench and ian holm .
when i hear the term 
`` warm-hearted comedy 
'' i usually cringe
unless the actor are first-rate .
dench and holm are wonder to watch
as they take something as light-weight and predictable as this script
and turn it into something
that charms us .
then there is the `` old oad '' gambit
that is fun
if you remember the old oad .
among the blonde bombhell are leslie caron 
joan sim 
olympia dukakis 
billie whitelaw and cleo laine .
laine sing three number and almost over-balance the production .
she is so strong and unique a jazz talent
that
while she is singing the program
nearly becomes the cleo laine show .
another attractive feature is the number of great wwii song
played in strong swing .
