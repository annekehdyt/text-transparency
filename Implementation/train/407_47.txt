what on earth has become of our dear ramu ?
is this the same man
who made sarkar 
satya 
and comapny ?
i refuse to believe so .
if aag was ramu 's most ambitious project ,
he has clearly jumped off the high cliff
he has ascended
by giving the industry some of the greatest work of all time .
this movie is made to fall like a ick .
i was cringing to leave the theater ,
but i was forced to sit
because i would not have been able to take my car out of the parking lot
before other also left .
else 
nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.this movie is nowhere close to sholay .
it does not even come near it within a mile .
i believe
ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay ,
since sarkar was a classic piece of work .
i read ramu 's interview a couple of day back ,
in which the interviewer said
that ramu does not sleep for more than 4 hour a day ,
that too not at a stretch .
i completely agree with this now ,
as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.there is no power in the performance .
amitabh bachchan does not even look scary .
he looked more terrifying in the few poster and wallpaper i saw earlier .
ramu 's favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar
because she did not have many dialog
( in fact none
if i remember clearly ) .
she opened her mouth in this movie ,
and has found a place in history .
the new guy
playing jai 's role seems to have that ash look ,
but did not manage jai 's role at all .
i can not go on ... im sorry ...
my pain is too big for me to manage right now.i promised myself throughout the movie
that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see
that it is still there.bottom line :
horrible movie .
the medium and critic are going to cook ramu 's goose .
and just to remind all reader once more ,
i am one of the biggest ramu fan ,
and even i can not spare him for this act .
