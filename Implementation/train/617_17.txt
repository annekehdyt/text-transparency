from the awful death scene to guns
that fire
without making sound to a character
called the fiend .
it is all tiresome 
slow moving 
unimaginative drivel .
it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around .
visually it was creepy
and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time ,
but even in 1936 one would think
that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this .
i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance
as person stood around making speech
and acting like they were posing at an office picnic .
and then there are those bullet as a previous commentator mentioned .
perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone 's pant pocket .
