i always enjoyed watching this
when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60 's .
it is a typical hollywood history epic 
dramatized 
stylized and full of inaccuracy but so what ,
it is an entertaining movie and a good looking film .
cecil b. demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film .
his son-in-law actor anthony quinn
who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film
is the director in his directorial debut and swan song
as he had never directed a film
before
and never would again .
demille assembled a crew
who had recently worked on his 10 commandment
to help quinn pull it off
including longtime demille associate
producer/actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project .
also from the 10 commandment are screenwriter jesse lasky 
cinematographer loyalk griggs 
assistant director francisco day 
2nd unit director arthur rosson 
art director walter tyler and hal pereira ,
set director sam comer and ray moyer ,
costume designer edith head 
john jensen and ralph lester
who as a costume design team
received the buccaneer 's only oscar nomination .
a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson .
also in the cast are charle boyer 
e.g .
marshall 
lorne greene 
claire bloom and inger steven .
at just over two hour it drags in some spot
but makes up for it with some excellent battle scene .
i would give it a 7.5/10 .
