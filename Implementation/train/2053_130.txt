`` deliverance '' is a dead-on example
of what wonderful movie came out of the '70 .
while your jaw is dropped during a `` terminator '' movie ,
are you really sacred ?
i do not think so ,
because you are there
to see what new cgis have been strung together -
plot matter
not.so many daily situation can become terrifying for no reason at all ,
because there are so many person
involved in daily living
- like a trip to the market ... ..or a walk down a dimly-lighted street .
`` deliverance '' is so frightening ,
because those innocent action can turn deadly in a heart-beat .
venturing into the backwood is a frolic in fun ?
anyone
who has that notion does not read the paper ,
watch the daily news 
nor has not seen some of the other movie
that depict the seriousness of `` trespassing '' into territory where outsider are not welcome .
it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on `` deliverance '' did not inform almost everyone going to view
it this was no picnic ,
and `` squeal like a pig '' was not a part of `` deulling banjos '' .i hate the term `` hillbilly '' ,
because - as some `` user '' wrote -
that demeans entire region of person
who are very content to live
as they know how -
without the interference of modern life .
much is made of `` ined '' -
that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwood .
`` chinatown '' should teach us that lesson .
however 
city-slicker are extremely dumb
to enter a closed society
and give them attitude .
i know lot of `` hillbilly '' -
they are moral person ,
when left to themselves .
their `` justice '' can be utal
when they feel threatened or humiliated 
just like the `` justice '' in city street .
they do not need any part of the city -
the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal site .
`` deliverance '' was the last film i
found jon voight to do any real acting -
i
hope i am wrong .
he was extremely underpaid for `` midnight cowboy '' ,
because he was unknown ,
but demonstrated
that he could do that role at the drop of a hat .
his acting in `` deliverance '' was superb .
it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary person
can move mountain ,
if it is necessary -
but who wants to be thought-of as `` ordinary '' today ?
his stifled sob at the dinner was illiant .
wow !
for burt reynold ! ! !
one must ask what led him into those other tacky film ?
his manliness 
although misguided 
in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary
to make it out of the wilderness -
not only in the backwood 
but the wilderness of everyday-life .
ned beatty was stellar -
his underwear may not have had `` versace '' stitched on it ,
but his shell-shocked performance was perfect .
as noted ,
he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie .
ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man
should have his determination to do what is right .
several `` user '' have theorized
he was shot 
or lost his balance
when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey ,
he committed suicide .
no gunshot was heard during the scene
and voight and beatty did not find a wound.james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale ,
and was great as the sheriff -
it is said
he was so terrified of acting
he came to the set drunk every day .
his character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving ,
but also knew
they did not stand a chance against a jury of the local person ,
no matter how kindly they were treated in `` aintry '' .
he was also aware
that the meaner of the local could be cruel .
justice ?
- `` do not come back up here again '' .
not many `` user '' knew `` hillbilly '' were used in the film
where ever it was possible -
what actor could portray them better ?
the `` mountain-man '' were actually mountain-man ... ...
.every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt
it was dangerous to play in .
play in ?
better `` fight-for-your-life '' in .
i have experienced some near-dangerous incident ,
and am content to live outside of the fray -
you guys
who feel your manhood raging
can have my part.that
we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable area of this country in undeniable .
to be able to view its grandeur on any medium is enthralling ,
but it leaves a bitter taste
to realize some do not care about it .
los angele ,
where i live ,
is a perfect example :
it is built-up right into the territory for wild animal ,
and steadfastly believes human come before animal .
those are their rightful habitat -
we should leave them be just that .
any wonder
why coyote and bear and wolf wander into neighborhood ?
they are theirs.in some less threatening way ,
we all need to experience the lesson
to be learned from `` deliverance '' -
to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy .
i thank all those city-slicker
who went out into the wilderness
to produce this modern classic ,
so that it can scare the heck out of me
when i watch it .
you can have the thrill of danger
- i will stick to the tv .
30-out-of-10 .
