but if you like the muppet i defy you to dislike this one .
basically the same plot regurgitated
( this time new york 
not la )
it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx .
a lot of the muppet leave the film pretty early on
as it centers around kermy and miss piggy .
i happened to have enjoyed it greatly .
fun to watch with your kid .
