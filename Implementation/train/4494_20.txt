i have only seen gretchen mol in two other film
( girl 6 
donnie brasco ) ,
and do not really remember her ,
but she did a great job as a naive girl
who posed for picture
because it made person happy.she really did not think
what she was doing was wrong ,
even when she left the business
and found her religion again.the photos
she made were certainly tame by today 's standard ,
and it is funny seeing man with camera get all excited 
and politician pontificating on the evil of pornography .
david strathairn
( good night ,
and good luck )
played a super part here.mary harron
( american psycho )
wrote
and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever .
