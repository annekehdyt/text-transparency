for anthony mann the western was 'legend'-
and 'legend ' makes the very best cinema !
mann 's work was full of intensity and passion 
visually dramatic ,
and the action always excitingly photographed ... stewart 
a docile actor with the ability
of displaying anger 
neurosis and cruelty ,
made with anthony mann 
five remarkable western :
`` winchester '73 ; '' `` bend of the river ; '' `` the naked spur ; '' `` the far country ; ''
and `` the man from laramie .
`` in `` winchester '73 
'' stewart reveals his darker side ... he offers all the reserve of anger 
inner ambivalence 
and emotional complexity in his nature
that his audience had 
up till this time ,
failed to catch ... a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style : shelley winter is at her saucy best ; dan duryea perfect as the vicious 
sneering psychopathic villain ; john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character ; charle drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor ; and a very young rock hudson 
attempts the role of an indian chief ... `` winchester '73 '' is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized 
rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876 ... stewart and his estranged other ,
who bears another name
( stephen mcnally ) ,
compete fiercely for possession of it 
and though stewart win 
mcnally steals it and sets off cross-country with stewart in pursuit ...
what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic ,
is stewart 's determination to revenge his father 's death at the hand
of that same renegade other\u0097a revenge
fed by long-standing fratricidal hatred ... photographed in gorgeous black and white ,
the film comes on as powerful and arresting ,
acted with deep feeling and intense concentration ,
not only by stewart but by all the supporting character ... look fast for a promising newcomer 
tony curtis 
the soldier
who finds the rifle after the indian attack ...
