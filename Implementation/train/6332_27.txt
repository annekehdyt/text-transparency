this movie had so much potential - a strong cast 
a reasonably strong idea
and clearly a decent budget .
i am not sure
where it all went wrong ,
but each of those element was wasted .
the story went nowhere ,
the character were hollow
to say
the least and the result was a very boring 
pointless 
waste of a film .
i hated it .
judging by the other vote ,
i am in the minority here
and must be some sort of freak .
however 
i thought
this movie was dreadful .
i had high hope ,
but was very disappointed .
a particular disappointment was jody foster 's character .
a very cocky `` fixer '' of sort makes a nice idea .
jody was confident and sexy ,
but the character did nothing and went nowhere .
denzel washington played the same character
he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new .
