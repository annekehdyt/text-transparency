this movie scared the crap out of me !
i have to admit
that i spent most of the film watching through my finger
but what i saw was really scary .
i screamed out loud two or three time during the show.film-making-wise my favorite aspect were the sound and photography .
the sound was particularly great
and the setting was really creepy beautiful .
i read somewhere
that it is some weird husband and wife team
that made it .
for some reason
that makes this even stranger for me .
if you enjoy the jump and jitter of scary movie
than this one is for you !
very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friend
who love to watch movie curled up on a sofa
screaming like little girl !
