every scene was put together perfectly.this movie had a wonderful cast and crew .
i mean 
how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr. in it ,
none have and ever will exist .
he has the ability
to ighten up any movie with his amazing talent.this movie
was perfect !
i saw this movie
sitting all alone on a movie shelf in `` blockbuster ''
and like it was calling out to me ,
i could not resist picking it up
and inging it home with me .
you can call me a sappy romantic ,
but this movie just touched my heart ,
not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time .
even though it made me cry ,
i admit 
at the end 
the whole movie just ightened up my outlook on life thereafter.i suggested to my horror 
action 
and pure humor movie buff of a other ,
who absolutely adored this movie .
this is a movie with a good sense of feeling.it could make you laugh out loud 
touch your heart ,
make you fall in love ,
and enjoy your life.every time you purposefully walk past this movie ,
just be aware
that you are consciously making the choice to live
and feel this inspiring movie.who knows ?
what if it could really happen to you ? ,
and keep your mind open to the mystical wonder of life .
