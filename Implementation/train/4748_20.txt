jeopardy has the feel
of being a stock movie of sort
- one of the movie
that the studio pumped out inbetween big budget/box office one .
it is a mere 70 minute
and does not feature many set ,
and the only star is barbara stanwyck .
but what a star 
of course .
stanwyck is a tough lady once again
as she runs into an escaped convict
while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert .
the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor ,
who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help .
some psychological battling there .
it is a surprisingly effective little movie -
its short length makes it taut ,
and that stanwyck is great should go
without mention
( but i will still praise her every time ) .
