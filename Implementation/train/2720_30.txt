when i bought this dvd i though :
`` it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationship
made up in portuguese standard let 's give it a chance '' i was totally wrong !
what a disappointing movie !
first 
it is not a comedy ;
it is a cheap drama
which can be so melodramatic
that it is even worse than many portuguese soap operas !
second 
the plot is so boring ,
and leads nowhere
it has no structure ,
it just flows 
like the wind 
in one or another direction the production is also bad !
the sound mixing is horrible ,
because sometimes the voice are disconnected .
it made me remind some old portuguese movie from the 80's the acting should have been better too well 
to sum up ,
it is not with film like this one
that portuguese cinema will improve !
in fact 
it was one of the worst portuguese movie i have seen in the last year !
bad argument 
bad acting 
bad production i had no high hope for this movie ,
but it was much worse
than i have ever imagined !
just forget about it !
