spoiler
( although none that are not revealed in the first two minute of the movie )
robin william is actually quite good in this as the friendly 
lonely 
emotionally stunted loser sy .
he makes a very human 
even sympathetic psycho ,
and really disappears into the character
-- no small feat for such a recognizable performer .
too bad
the rest of the movie is such a waste .
the supporting performance
( and performer )
would not look out of place in a soft-core porno
( it does not help that every character
but sy is made of 100 % cardboard ) .
at time 
the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense :
we know from the very first moment a )
that sy is a complete whack-job 
b )
that he survives ,
and c )
that he gets nabbed by the cop at the end .
so all we are left to ponder is the how and the whys ,
and the answer provided are not all
that interesting.the plot is plodding and contrived ,
and features some nonsensical moment
( for instance ,
the husband berates his wife for her expensive taste ,
even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore ) .
about two third of the way through 
sy does something so irredeemably stupid
that it makes one wonder
how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme .
and the final clich\u00e9d explanation of his psychosis 
right out of `peeping tom 
' is a terrible copout.the dialogue is of the absolute worst sort .
it is not overwritten 
or awkward 
or unbelievable 
or bad in any other way
that could be considered fun 
even for bad-movie lover .
instead 
every line is purely 
hideously functional
-- it is as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter
and said 
`hey ,
i need a workable script on this
-- in an hour . '
it made me want to scream ,
honestly.this movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware-the-help thriller of the eighty and ninety
( `the hand
that rocks the cradle 
' e.g .
) ,
and
while it is certainly unpleasant ,
it is never really scary .
sy 's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable ,
but on its own
that is not enough
to make the film work .
in the end 
lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved 
except robin william 
sink this one .
3/10 .
