this movie is not very good.in fact ,
it is the worst elvis movie i have seen.it has very little plot 
mostly partying 
beer drinking and fighting .
burgess meredith and thomas gomez are wasted .
i do not know
why they did this movie.you could say
elvis was wasted as well ,
he is much 
much better in `` follow that dream . ''
