finally a thriller
which omits the car chase 
explosion and other eye catching effect .
the movie combines a simple plot
( assasination of a french president )
with an excellent background .
it takes a look behind man behavior with authority ,
and explains
why we would obey almost every order
( even murder )
which would be given to us.furthermore it shows us
how secret service can manipulate the run of history
and how hardly they can be controlled .
the best thing on this movie is ,
that there is no classic `` hollywood end ''
which can easily be predicted .
