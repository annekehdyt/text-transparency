frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situation
where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time ;
and just at the moment
you realize
you should not be laughing ,
you have already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness ;
and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide-open mouth and glazen eye ,
you feel a piercing ache
beginning in the pit of your stomach
and suddenly rushing up your throat and ... well ,
you get the point.but for all its unpleasantness and punch in the face 
frownland ,
really is a remarkable piece of work that ,
after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic trouble and mishap ,
makes you want to scratch your own eye out and at the same time ,
you feel
sickenly sorry for him.it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein 's film 
but for some insane reason 
i felt an unwavering determination
to stay the course
and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer .
if someone sets you on fire ,
you typically want to put it out :
stop !
drop !
and roll !
but with this film 
you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body .
you endure the pain
-- perhaps out of spite 
or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can not even begin to attempt to explain.unfortunately ,
mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you .
but if you get a chance
to catch it ,
prepare yourself :
ing a doggie bag .
