this series would have been a lot better
if they had just done one simple thing :
made ian mcshane code name :
diamond head instead of code name :
tree .
diamond head the character needs someone
who could handle the role of the lovable rogue ,
which mcshane proved
he could do with the lovejoy series .
roy thinne 
the actual diamond head 
is really only so-so in the role .
mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree .
france nuyen 's character 
tso-tsing 
can not seem to make up her mind
as to whether she is the hapless victim or the tough-and-ready-to-fight woman .
she really earned her pay at the end
when she had to play the role of diamond head 's lover .
after viewing an episode or two ,
i ended up not caring what happened to anyone .
tree gives us a lot to hate him ,
but diamond head gives us nothing to like him .
unfortunately 
the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite
as it was in the 1960 's .
