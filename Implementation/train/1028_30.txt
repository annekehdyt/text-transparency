what keeps us going - or at least what i feel
the writer wanted us
to keep us glued at an early point
is our desire
to know
whether martinaud has done the dirty deed .
without spoiling so much ,
of course there is a red herring and a twist .
but then we discover
that this is the story of martinaud 's imperfection and his difficulty in coping .
when there is the revelation -
we begin to sympathize and pity him
because as the story progresses we are made to think
he is the sick 
perverted pedophiliac
that we are predisposed to have in mind .
one of those thing
he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have
even though they live on the same roof .
these problem of course are given their denouement in the film 's shocking finale.this movie demands your patience
and it has certainly tried those of restless teenager
sitting at the rear .
they were heckling obviously
because they are not partial to `` central location '' film .
although there is a bit of travelling ,
when we get to the wood and the beach .
and we realize
that gallien is not as clever
as we are made to think
he is.the inquisitor is 5/5
