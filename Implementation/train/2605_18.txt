it is hard to believe an `` action '' packed jet li movie could be so boring ,
but this was transcendant trash .
the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flick .
the martial art action is all special effect and no human talent .
it is a comic book story about a group of super-human soldier
who are to be killed
because they are mentally unstable 
one of their number
( li )
who hold off an incompetent army
to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist liarian .
the saved killer resurface with an austin power quality plot
to take over the world ,
and li shed his new life
to save the world.the version i
saw was dubbed ,
and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin plot and comic-book 25 cent special effect .
but i suspect even ninja-turtle-watching 8-year old would have found this juvenile and hollow .
