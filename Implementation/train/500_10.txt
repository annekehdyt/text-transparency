power ranger 
the moronic merchandising television kid show from the 1990s ,
has got to be the most pointless
and ridiculous television show ever created.what
exactly is the point of this show anyway ,
other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to child ?
there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway.look at the costume ,
which look like spandex gone bad.the mullet style hair 
earring ,
and fashion of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days.avoid this show at all cost !
