this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story
that is handled exceptionally well
-- thank to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performance .
dana andrew star as a hot-headed detective
who all too
often uses his fist instead of his ain .
soon after the film begins 
andrew is being reprimanded for this and is warned
that if this continues he will be off the force .
a bit later ,
while investigating a crime
he is attacked by a suspect
and andrew is forced to fight to protect himself .
this time he does not use excessive force
but the assailant is killed .
andrew panic and assumes
they will not believe him
so he tries to cover up the death
-- though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime.there is a lot more to the film than this --
including a plot
involving a slimy villain
( gary merrill )
and a love interest for andrew
( gene tierney ) .
all in all 
this is one of the better example of the genre
-- with great gritty dialog 
superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story .
this is the way
noir was meant to be .
