i thought
that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i
finally saw it ,
i took a good surprise.the movie is not great thing
but it is very fun
and the action scene are very well done.this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias.it is very similar to that series
and it reminded me too ,
to the wolfgang petersen 's thriller in the line of fire.if you are going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thriller in the history of movie ,
you will be disappointed.but
if you go with little expectation ,
you will enjoy the sentinel.rating:7
