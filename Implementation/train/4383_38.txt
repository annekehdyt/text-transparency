an older man touches a flower in his wife 's greenhouse
that seems to be wilting .
he gets pricked by it ,
or bitten by something on it .
he quickly becomes ill ,
and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind .
a later attempt
to resuscitate him with paddle result in a splatter of blood.a cop
is at the hospital
because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out .
somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctor 
as well as an entomologist
who is ought in .
there are several young kid wandering around the hospital ,
who i suppose
we are supposed to find adorable ,
but who are extremely annoying little at .
they happen to wander into the room
where the speciman is being kept ,
and happen to dump a growth hormone on it .
horror movie logic would say
they deserve to die for this ,
but they are never even in any danger.the critter grow and starts eeding .
person run away from it ,
and sometimes toward it for some reason .
the hospital gets
surrounded by military
who are prepared to destroy everything
if need be.there are no really compelling character in the movie ,
and most of the time
it seems like person
are searching around for the monster .
it was fairly boring .
clearly it owes something to the alien movie ,
with the monster being born inside a human
and having several stage of its growth .
there is also a character named bishop ,
and the lead actress has sigourney weaver 's hair .
