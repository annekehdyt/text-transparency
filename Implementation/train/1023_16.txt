overall i would have to say
that i liked the movie .
some of the fight scene are really good .
especially the fight against leung ka-yan .
one point
that really bothered me
was the fact
that they used an asian
to play a black man .
i mean really .
talk about bad taste .
during a fight scene ,
you see one of the fighter on the floor is laughing .
otherwise 
sammo copy bruce lee 's fighting move perfectly .
5/10 star .
