'had ned kelly been born
later he probably would have won a victorium cross at gallipolli ' .
such was ned 's bravery.in australia and especially country victorium the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised .
in greta he is still a hero ,
the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism
he created ,
but in mansfield they still have not forgotten
that the three policeman
that he 'murdered ' were from there.many of the building
he visited in his life are still standing .
from the old melbourne gaol
where he was hanged ,
to the post office he held up in jerilderie .
a cell he was once held in in greta
is on display in benella and the site of ann jone ' hotel 
the station and even the log
where he was captured in glenrowan
can be visited.evidence of all the event in the movie
( except for his love interest ) can be found all over victorium 
in police record and even in the sash
that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning .
none of this is wrong ,
and what left out would further justify neds action .
the horse that ned 'stole ' was actually stolen by wild wright
( the man
who ned box with after getting out of jail ) .
ned was already in prison
when the horse was reported stolen
so he could not have stolen it.the jerilderie letter
is more
than what has been stated before .
it is not self justification
it is ned 's biography 
an outline of what he stood for
and who he was protecting .
so go ahead
and read it ,
watch the movie and then make up your mind
about what ned stood for .
