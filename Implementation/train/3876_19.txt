this film is too skeletal .
it is a fairly low-budget film
( i hope ! )
which excuses it somewhat ,
but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much .
phillip is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family
who 's searching for himself
( though his family is ... er ... well 
a little too white ... ) ,
but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws .
every moment
that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama ,
and there are *way* too many sub-plot
( which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency .
they needed filler ... )
i would not recommend this film to anyone
who is not either a hard-core phillip fan ,
or who has absolutely *nothing* to do .
4/10 .
