there are so many `` hollywood '' movie made now
that are not only torture to watch ,
but also have no bearing on anyone 's life 
whatsoever .
granted 
movie do not always have to have deep meaning ,
but it is nice to know
that there are still film-maker out there
who care about telling `` human '' story .
i will not give away the premise of this illiant film 
however ,
the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable one i have ever seen in my life ,
and i am a 32-year-old film buff too !
bug rank top ten on my list of favorite ,
which includes :
on the waterfront 
sunset boulevard 
and black narcissus ,
to name just a few .
this `` moving '' movie should become one of your favorite also-
that is ,
if you have a heart !
