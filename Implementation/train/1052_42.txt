honestly
before i watched this movie ,
i had heard many person
said
this movie was a disgrace .
i did not believe
that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken role in this movie ,
and watched it by my own .
apparently they were right .
i was really disappointed
and wondering all the time during the movie -
why the hell did i watch this movie.of course i
was not expecting much from justin
as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business .
but morgan and kevin ?
i could not stop asking myself
why the heck they agreed to take part in edison .
to be honest ,
their role are rather stupid.well you might think
if the player suck 
then i should pay more attention to the story .
it is indeed story is the core of a movie ,
but guy ... trust me ... this is not a movie
you want to give a credit for its story .
imagine this 
a smart-ass journalist
( justin timberlake )
wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real ' journalist from his boss
( morgan freeman ) .
this all was supported by one agent
who still has heart for justice
( ll cool j )
and an illiant investigator
( kevin spacey ) .
at the end 
they beat the system with a happy
ending story.jeez ,
i could not even carry on with this .
just recalling the movie is making me sick already .
my advise guy 
do not watch this !
please save your money and time for another movie .
