although the casting for this film was admirable 
particularly dianne keaton and tom everett scott 
the quality of the writing was so poor
that it would be impossible for any actor or director
to make this film worth watching.my wife and i decided
that the reason
we watched the entire film
was that it was like a train wreck ,
and it was almost impossible to turn away .
it may have been that we `` hoped ''
that the message would eventually make itself apparent ,
and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort .
unfortunately 
this did not happen.of course the audience may have been able to `` make sense '' of this convoluted tale 
a credit to the ingenuity of the human ain
to make sense of the absurd .
the writer 
however 
did nothing to facilitate this innate need
we seem to have for finding meaning.it was apparent
that those involved were simply going through the motion of their respective craft ,
and
that any intrinsic passion for the character or the story was either secondary or non-existent.unfortunately ,
made-for-tv movie have seemed to devolve over the year .
wherea communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writer in the past ,
present-day writer and producer seem condescending to their audience ,
concentrating primarily on manipulating us to `` stay-tuned '' through the incessant advertising
which seems to be the only reason movie such as surrender ,
dorothy are made .
