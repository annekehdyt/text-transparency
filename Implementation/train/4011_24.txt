another in the they do not make em like that category .
this story of a family with some real skeleton in its closet still qualifies as good clean 
sometimes over-the-top fun .
robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley sibling ,
and they really took the role
and ran with them .
malone won an oscar
and stack was nominated in the supporting category ,
both honor being eminently well-deserved .
they counterbalance the somewhat bland lead .
neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actor ,
but they have both had better part
and played them far more convincingly
than they do here .
it is kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson
playing such a red-blooded heterosexual
as he does here ,
but that is more of a personal bias than anything else .
but that does not take away from the movie 's overall entertainment value ,
which is considerable
and this movie is extremely watchable .
if you are up some night
and this movie comes on i would say watch it .
it is well worth it .
