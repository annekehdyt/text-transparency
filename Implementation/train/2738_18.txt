i thoroughly enjoyed this movie ,
but it is nothing new.everyone here is grouping it with other war movie ,
this movie has been miscategorized !
its not a war movie any
more than `` one flew over the cuckoos nest ''
is a asylum movie
or `` cool hand luke '' is a prison movie .
this is a movie about individuality 
nonconformity 
self-confidence and the cost
of that personality type.the plot is the same
as `` one flew over the cuckoos nest ''
and `` cool hand luke '' 
its in good company ,
and it holds its own .
its these movie
it should be held up against and compared 
not `` apocalypse now '' or `` platoon '' .eric
