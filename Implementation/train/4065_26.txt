although i rated this movie a 2
for showing a complete lack of effort
in trying to create a quality horror film
it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale .
i could not figure out what was going on in the movie
or who the person were but i did not care
because i knew every scene
was going to have something
to make me cry with laughter .
dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie
but i believe
this is because they started filming
without a script .
the fact
that there is no plot line
makes the movie extremely versatile .
it does not matter
if you sit down
and watch the movie from beginning to end
or if you watch it in rewind you
will be confused with enjoyment .
i particularly like the scene
in which the inmate are taking turn running around outside beating each other with stick .
i believe
the doctor refer to this as treatment .
genius !
