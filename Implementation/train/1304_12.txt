at least it is not full of sensless violence or fluff .
it is also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline .
this story had some potential
but the director appears to have lost site of the green .
the story is disjointed
and goes off in strangedirection 
to no conclusion .
i also do not believe
the director spent much time around a golf country club 
either .
some of the depiction are absurd .
not very engaging .
