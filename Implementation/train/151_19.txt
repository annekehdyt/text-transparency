my child watch the show everyday that its on .
its a great program for younger child .
however they need to stop showing re-runs
and do some more actual show
and get rid of rooney 's and deedee 's yellow tooth .
moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie tooth and the child notice these thing
and ask
if the 2 do not ever ush their tooth ?
does the show ever make its way to the united state
and if so where can we find its schedule at .
and one other thing if we might be able to add .
moe you need to stop hiding so much .
sometimes when you pop up out of no
where you scare the younger child
and what with the pulling of the rope ?
what does that signify ?
other then getting wet all the time .
they need to add newer thing to their show instead of the same ole same ole .
kid loose interest that way .
