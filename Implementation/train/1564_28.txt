the secret of kell is one of the most unique 
beautiful ,
and eye- popping animated film i have ever seen .
before watching this film ,
i was convinced
that nothing could give up a run for its money
and that it was a shoo-in
to win in this category ,
but i found in kell a serious contender.the secret of kell tell the story of a young orphan
named brendan ,
who lives with his uncle 
the abbot of kell .
the abbot is a loving guardian 
but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by viking
than he is at nurturing the boy 's imagination .
when the legendary brother aidan
( who looks surprisingly like willie nelson )
shows up
and takes the boy under his wing ,
brendan goes on a journey into the wood and meets a lovely forest nymph
named aisling
who takes a liking to him
( and saves his life more than once ) .
with aisling 's help 
he attempts to save the town
and help brother aidan complete the mystical book which\u0097legend has it\u0097can turn dark into light.see my full review of the secret of kell at :
