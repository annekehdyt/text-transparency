i thought
`` intensive care '' was quite bad and very unintentionally funny .
but at least not as bad as i thought
it might be .
sometimes it is somewhat suspenseful ,
but never a good shocker.spoiler aheadthe fun lies in ridiculous moment .
but the all-time classic moment is this :
peter
( koen wauter )
is stabbed
and beaten by the killer .
he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway .
amy
( nada van nie )
kneel beside him
and asks `` poor peter ,
shall i get you a band-aid ?
`` .this movie was shot in dutch and english .
to spare cost ,
all license plate are usa ,
and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan .
very funny if you are dutch
and watching the original version in dutch .
