the crater lake monster is easily one of the most awful ,
amateurish film i have ever seen - ranking right up there with mano 
the hand of fate in term of poor acting 
useless direction 
and kindergarten-level production value .
in this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wake up after a meteor hits a lake in bumblebum 
ca ,
and begins dining on the local hayseed .
in the thrilling climax 
the creature ,
described by one local as `` a giant alligator with flipper '' ,
drags it is ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch ,
before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of time
and it dies from boredom .
every character in this moovie is a complete moron .
one pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store
to purchase a $ 4.75 pint of ripple ;
instead of simply buying the bottle ,
the idiot shoot the cashier and another bystander ,
shoot at a cop 
gets chased towards the lake ,
all so that he can eaten by the monster .
unfortunate close-up of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam .
there is a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent
( to make him seem more legit ) ,
two overly-bumbling redneck boat renter 
some cheesy `` pre-historic cave art '' done in crayon ,
and annoying banjo-pickin ' background moosic .
in one painful scene 
the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minute by cowmenting on how may stars
they can see in the night sky ,
even though it is clearly day time still .
even on constant fast-forward 
this moovie hurts 
and hurts bad .
moocow says
call the fumigator 
'cause this cow pie really stinks !
