the sarah silverman program is ... better than those other show .
no laugh track 
no painful joke 
just a program .
the sarah silverman program .
if you are like me ,
and you love comedy ,
this is probably a show for you.sarah silverman ings out-there-funny 
and right-here-funny to the table with ease .
a mix of different style ,
which makes for its own.this program
is not something
you want to start a compare war with ,
seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them
( other show ) .
this show is its own entity ,
and i think
most comedy head will like it just fine.go watch and see .
