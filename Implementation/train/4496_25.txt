i saw this movie on the hallmark channel
and thought
it was wonderful ,
especially since it was based on a true man .
pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man
who took on the persona of the half eed grey owl .
the photography was beautiful.this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney
known simple as grey owl .
i want to read as much as i can about him .
at the time i did not know
richard attenborough had directed it .
but i am not surprised .
i like all his movie
whether he
is acting or directing .
i gave it the highest rating .
however 
i would have liked to have seen more in the movie
about why he took on this persona
as it only showed the two aunt
who raised him
and his room in their house.you can not go wrong with this movie
if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story
without hearing foul language
and contrived special effect every few minute .
