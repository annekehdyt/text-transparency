to a certain extent 
i actually liked this film better than the original vampire .
i found
that movie to be quite misogynistic .
as a woman and a horror fan 
i am used to the fact
that woman in peril are a staple of the genre .
but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much .
in this movie 
natasha wagner is a more fully-realized character ,
and the main bad guy is a gal !
arly jover
( who played a sidekick vamp in blade )
is very otherworldly and deadly .
jon bon jovi ... okay 
yeah 
no great actor ,
but he does ok. at least he does not start to sing .
catch it on cable
if you can .
it is on encore action this month .
