`` i love new york '' is another entry by vh-1
( mtv network )
showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill 
obnoxious 
woman .
it must have been an easy decision
to take the most wildest 
ebonic speaking 
craziest contestant - and her mother -
and give them a show on this network .
many will argue ,
`` this is a show '' .
true 
it is not as bad
as it is previous show 
`` flavor of love '' -
but it is just as bad.it reminds me of a skit from the 90 's show `` in living color ''
where keenan ivory wayan was imitating the boxer mike tyson on `` the love connection '' dating show
and he picked `` robin given '' for a date .
mike talked of how the date was okay ,
but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in .
this show reminds me of that.the man are chosen
and given name to degrade themselves and the woman
that they are dating more -
( i would think an intelligent man
looking to date an intelligent woman
would not allow her - and her mother -
to give you a name
that is so ghetto ,
you will embarrass yourself every time
you appear on tv . )
but these are professional reality actor ,
so why bother.it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this .
the fact
that this is as fake
as her newly implanted addition ?
15 minute of fame and hundred of thousand of dollar in ad time for the network ?
( well 
you can not hate them for trying to make a buck . )
maybe the wonder is -
who would want to be with this woman past an hour ?
or wonder if she and her mother 's next show would be on the wwf !
any way
you slice it ,
it is a train wreck
you have seen countless time
before so by now the shock value is down to nil.no twist
or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck 
or any different from any of the other .
appeal to the lowest common denominator and for those
calling an `` end '' to reality show ,
this is just another nail in the coffin
as to why they should end 
immediately .
