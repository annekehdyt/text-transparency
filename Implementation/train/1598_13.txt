i am sorry to say
that it was one of the worst film i
have ever seen .
although visually fascinating
( e.g .
the use of colour was absolutely stunning ) ,
it was pretty boring and disturbing
( see the father/son incest )
.what is more ,
music is totally absent ,
and if you think of those wonderful soundtrack by michael nyman
( who wrote the soundtrack for most of greenaway 's film )
then you can imagine what a difference it makes .
