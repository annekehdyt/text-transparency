this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer .
the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critic in canne ,
but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director
to get himself noticed .
hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence 
drug abuse or juvenile delinquency
( or any other issue ,
for that matter )
.the main character 's metamorphosis from good ,
but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent ,
whereas the rape scene
( being an over-dragged ,
exaggerated version of the rape scene from `` a clockwork orange '' )
is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic value .
there are some thing
an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal .
at least in my opinion.to wrap it up :
shockingly utal 
revolting and not worth your time .
see `` a clockwork orange '' or `` le pianiste '' instead .
