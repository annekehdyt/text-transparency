this movie had me going .
the title was perhaps the greatest idea
that i heard .
i thought
it was an independent movie about a zombie outeak and their quest
to take over the us and a group of lone survivor 
band together ,
and plan to take out the zombie .
dead wrong !
it is about a psycho cop with a weakness
for killing his female arrest gets what is coming to him
when a pack of zombie woman rise from their grave
in order to get proper revenge .
as you can see
there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved .
where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster
caused our nation.first off ,
the zombie woman look like victorium secret model with dark eyeliner and a pale face .
what are zombie but mindless 
debatable intelligent 
cannibalistic killing machine
that eat as a result of their primitive most basic need ?
these zombie woman walk like streetwalker and runway model ,
they talk
as if they are in a poor film noir movie
and not do they act like real zombie .
sure the eating and killing is there ,
but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement ?
although it is a very interesting concept
and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre ,
it makes fun of that genre and asks the question ,
`` why can not zombie be beautiful vixen killing machine ? ''
i would say
that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie
that was produced
and made by garage junkie .
i would not recommend this movie
to anybody
that loves zombie genre too much ,
it is an insult and as for scary not even .
