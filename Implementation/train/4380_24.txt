despite its stereotype 
virtually 'no-name ' cast and an obviously low budget i thought
this film was alright ;
much better than i expected it to be .
i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus
that can also infect person
seemed a little ludicrous to me .
but in the end 
i thought
the film handled the concept well
( even if some scene were a little clich\u00e9d )
.the cast was quite good ,
and the two lead seemed to take their role very seriously .
i could not help thinking 
though ,
that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look-a-like .
maybe it is just her face or the make-up 
hair and clothe
she had in this movie
but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind
the whole time.while it is not a 'must see ' or a great film by any standard ,
'fatal error ' is an entertaining flick
that will keep you
watching until the end .
