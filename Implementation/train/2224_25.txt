i do not know
why i picked this movie to watch ,
it has a strange title and from the description
it just looked like something different .
every once in a while its good
to try a film
that is slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different .
right from the beginning this film had me intrigued
but i could not figure out why until the end if the film
when i realized
that the movie was great
because the character were so real .
i thought
the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them
and hope thing turn out well for them in the end .
i think
that everyone
who watches the film
could in some way
relate to one of the character and this makes for great viewing and some good laugh at the sheer ordinariness of the actor .
at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being ,
and are left with the 'thing are going to be ok ' type of a feeling .
i am sure
this will have wide appeal
and should be given a chance .
