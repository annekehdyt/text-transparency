if you have trouble
suspending disbelief then this is not for you .
consider :
a woman
already in late middle age
finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch
and raises it as her own .
think about it ;
she makes no attempt to locate the mother ,
who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment
and seemingly no one from the italian equivalent of social service makes any attempt
to put the baby into 'care '
( no social service ?
now i know
it is a fantasy ) .
before you know
it young toto is ten or so
and his adoptive mother dy leaving him to the orphanage from which
he emerges a happy man
who loves everybody .
in nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man
who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide shantytown resident and for an encore
he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman
who buys the land
on which the shantytown stands
when oil is discovered there .
this wants some swallowing
without the subsequent 'miracle ' beginning with toto 's dead mother
( the old lady
who raised him rather than his biological one )
appearing to him and handing him a dove
which doubles as a magic wand
allowing him to grant modest wish and a finale
in which the hobos fly away to a better place
located presumably somewhere over the rainbow.on the other hand
the film is up to here with charm
and is easy to surrender to .
on balance a small masterpiece .
