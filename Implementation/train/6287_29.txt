there is a remark
that one of heroine was raped on `` drunken rampage '' by russian soldier ,
which is completely untrue .
this movie should not be shown
only because of this.also there is a statement by someone ,
that kgb prosecuted `` jew 
gypsy etc '' ,
which is `` worse than nazis '' .
kgb was looking for so called `` zionist '' agent ,
who were
( kgb believed )
imperialist agent .
this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation ,
as nazis did .
gypsy were never prosecuted .
kgb was political tool
and used politically 
but from internationalist standpoint .
communist really did not distinguish between nationalities.whole movie stink like fake .
main hero does not speak russian ,
sign in berlin
contain typographical error ,
kgb general look totally phony .
some so called `` russian proverbs ''
are totally made up ,
and list goes on and on.not
recommended to watch - this movie is full of ly 
and phony stuff .
go to `` good shepherd '' instead .
