i should love this movie .
the acting is very good
and barbara stanwyck is great
but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me .
the movie makes
working class person
look low and cheap .the fact
that the daughter is ashamed of her mother
and that the daughter does not rise above
it has always made me a bit uneasy .
barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mother love
to find happiness with her well
to do father family .
i wonder
how many other
who have seen this film feel this way
about it.again the acting was very very good
and worth watching .
i really do not like the story line .
just a personal preference .thank
you
