i have always been a fan of the show
so i will admit
that i am biased .
when the show 's run ended ,
i felt like too many question remained unanswered .
this movie to me felt like closure .
to see all the person i would followed over the past few year together at last was most rewarding .
i have heard
that this is probably the only homicide movie
that we can expect .
if that is so ,
this is the appropriate way
to go out .
this movie is sometimes poignant 
sometimes upsetting ,
but always satisfying .
if you are or ever
have been a fan of the show 
watch this movie .
