ahh this film had so much potential !
a good cast of quality b actor 
the thigh of jessica simpson and ...
that is about it !
i believe
some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea .
basically 
let do a kind of legally blond film ,
but do it in new york .
that big ight city of chance 
power and money
and where everyone is a heartless ,
power/money hungry person .
let 's add to this jessica simpson 
small town bimbo ,
that other of owen wilson and for some no apparent reason andy dick
( only because of him you should ignore this film )
.basic story line :
boy leaves girl for ny 
girl follows 
boy cheat 
girl stay in ny with cousin 
gets a job under false pretense 
mucks up ,
is courted by other boy
( brother wilson )
and together save the day
and kiss.a few word come to mind
when reflecting upon this film 
i.e .
dire 
awful 
unbearable 
intolerable and xenophobicjust do not watch this film ,
you will be happier .
one reviewer referred to guantanamo and i definitely agree with him .
this film induces shock .
and i know
what you are thinking ...
at least at some point will i see simpson naked or close too .
it is not gon na happen ,
spare yourself the time and youtube her .
you will have better sexy time !
the film editing is flimsy 
the acting is unbearable ,
and why do they use blue screen ? in conclusion ;
this is cinematic treason
which should be punished to the maximumanother question
why does willie nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every jessica simpson flick
and why are there no black 
latin 
asian or european person in this movie ?
