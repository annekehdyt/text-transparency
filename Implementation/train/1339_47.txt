as incredible
as it may seem ,
gojoe is an anime- and hong kong-inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message .
this ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist
( a great acting job
done by daisuke ryu ) ,
a killer-turned-to-boddhist-monk benkei .
benkei has sworn never to kill again ,
but he still takes up the sword
to fight what he thinks
is a demon invasion ...
gojoe is a film difficult to rate .
it is visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful ,
but it uses too much trickery
( circling camera and high speed drife 
expressionistic shot 
leeched color 
digital effect etc .
) 
so the end result is somewhat tiring .
that said ,
the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful .
if only the director sogo ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks.other problem with gojoe is the amount of violence .
for a film with such an anti-violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time
to depict the endless battle scene .
also 
the way
the violence is shown
is always on the edge
of being self-indulgent ;
in fact 
a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the film signature image .
luckily 
ishii is wise enough to show the ugly 
tragic side of violence as well .
still 
it seems
that ishii is not sure
whether he is making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory .
the audience can not be sure of this 
either 
until the very end of the film .
the powerful
( albeit cynical )
ending is what saves gojoe ;
it clearly emphasizes
that this film is something more than a mere gore-fest .
