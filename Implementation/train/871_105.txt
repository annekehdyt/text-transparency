recently 
i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city
( olathe 
ks . )
of this title .
it is difficult for me ,
being a lover of the art as i am ,
to report the following 
but 
the truth sometimes hurts 
and quite frankly
after sitting through this tripe
( i am using the slang definition here - worthless statement or writing )
for an hour and a half 
i feel obligated to share
( warn )
any interested party .
let 's begin at the beginning 
a good place
to start as always .
the first 15 minute are not really that bad 
a couple of laugh 
and decent development ,
but then it is downhill from there .
this is the story of a woman 
in her mid thirty ,
that
( as the writer would like for you to believe )
is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled .
the first major difficulty occurs
when if you do not know
that fact going into the movie ,
you will not know it
when she suddenly risks it all for 
in my opinion 
a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman .
there is little development
( drastically insufficient development )
to justify her action for the affair
she has ,
and
when it occurs ,
one feel ,
as i did ,
that she is just of low moral character .
the word `` slut '' comes to mind 
hopefully ,
they will let
that pass the review and post the comment .
this 
in my opinion 
is the first fatal flaw of the film .
if you are married or have ever been in love ,
irregardless of whether you are male or female ,
its going to turn you off .
quite frankly 
i feel
that it would have made a much better `` blue movie ''
-
that is the level in my opinion
of which the screenplay is deserving .
the second fatal flaw is the casting ,
diane lane just did not work for me here ,
and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job ,
believe me .
the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin 
the depth of her ability as a fine actress shine in place 
conveying a subtle yet very blunt
( i apologize for the dichotomy
but it is accurate )
portrayal of an emerging teen .
bravo 
well done .
i am not going to give the ending away ,
but i was disappointed ,
being billed as a slice of life romance
is one thing ...
but an ending like that ... . well ,
if that teased you enough to see this picture ,
do not say
i did not warn you ,
but you better look fast -
if this celluloid is released ,
i doubt it goes four week before bursting into flame .
i would say wait for the video ,
but the free sex education tape at most video rental outlet have more entertainment value .
hmmm 
dustin hoffman produced this ,
you think
he had learn after ishtar .
this film once carried the working title `` blouse man ''
and should have been left on the rack .
if you have never in your life
wanted to walk out on a film ,
give this one 35-40 minute 
the only thing worth
staying for is anna paquin ,
if you can stomach the fact
that you will find your mind drifting
to whether or not you took out the garbage
before you left home ,
which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place
if you are off to the movie to see this one .
that is my two cent ,
for what it is worth .
