i am surprised at imdb 's low rating of this movie .
with all due respect 
its low rating is representative of the iq level of those
who rated it so poor .
they would rather see a movie with cheap thrill 
a bigger budget 
and more gore.the first misconception by person
is that this is a horror film .
it is not ,
nor does the film mislead you into believing
it is one .
it is a psychological thriller .
it is for person
who actually want an intellectual experience
when watching a movie .
reel.com 's review is the perfect example
of how i feel about this movie .
all the other negative review does not make much sense .
it is almost
as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days-
is something bad and not worth it.i will reveal some spoiler for the moron
who said
it was boring
and did not make sense .
martha was ainwashing herself and performing experiment on herself to be a caring mother
while she really was an evil nazi
who would kill
without warning .
the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact
that at first viewing ,
we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film 's direction and writing.i definitely feel
that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 's range on originality alone .
i recommend this movie for the person on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart person-
since this movie is obviously being butchered by those
who would rather watch scream or freddy 's nightmare.kudos to the acting as well .
for such a low budget film 
you are amazed
that this movie did not hit your local cinema with the great direction 
writing 
and acting .
please do not be fooled by the rating by imdb .
this movie is worth it .
i actually recommend buying the film
since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .
