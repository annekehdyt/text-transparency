dragon hunter has to be the best-looking animated film i
have ever seen .
it was jaw-dropping .
the film is about a couple rogue in search for some cash ,
their weird furry blue dog
that pees fire 
and a girl
who dreams about becoming a knight ,
and they are sent on a quest to go to the end of the earth
to kill the world gobbler 
an impossibly immanse dragon .
but honestly 
it does not even matter what the film is about .
because 
it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous .
the gravity in this fantasy world is different 
so block of architecture and sphere of land float around amidst cathedral and castle and village alike ,
and there are forest of floating lily pad .
the world is so creative ,
so uniquely beautiful ,
with a sort of muted storybook look to it .
the world looks like a set of gorgeous painting .
the monster are visually stunning as well 
like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bat .
some of the plot is not too original ,
like the main protagonist wanting their farm a la of mouse and man
and never seem to be able to make it in the world ;
but the gorgeous graphic 
some seriously sinister scene 
and emotion-evoking dialog makes this film spectacular .
