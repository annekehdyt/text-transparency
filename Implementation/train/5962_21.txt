i am sorry to say this ,
but the acting in this film is horrible .
the dialogue sounds
as if they are reading their line for the first time ever .
perhaps i got the `` dress rehearsal '' version by mistake .
the director over-uses slow motion during special effect perhaps as an attempt
to compensate for the poor performance of the actor themselves .
the story is pretty well written ,
and the fight sequence are actually better
than i have seen in many action film .
the fight seem pretty real .
but all of this happens
while to two leading actor time and time again miraculously survive incredible amount of point-blank automatic weapon fire 
grenade 
morter round 
and bazooka .
the enemy soldier are definitely some of the worst shot i
have ever seen ,
especially when they have the escaping truck in their sight from about 30 yard ,
and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 foot .
those bazooka need serious site caliation .
