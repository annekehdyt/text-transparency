twisted 
bizarre 
enchanting 
and hilarious !
i could not stop laughing watching this film .
darren stein presents the movie
he made on the family camcorder
growing up in southern california in the 1980 's .
it is an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivation and ability
to manipulate for the camera .
manipulation is a strong word ,
however do not we all watch movie to be manipulated in some way or another ?
from the beginning 
i was amused at the fact
that the boy in the film seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible .
later 
darren comment about his budding homosexuality ,
and you can see it from the hint
( big hint ! )
of flamboyance at an early age .
maybe it was just the warm southern california weather ,
who knows ?
as a gay man
who also grew up in a nurturing environment ,
it is great to see
that his parent supported and loved him ,
and that his friend seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the len .
`` put the camera on me '' offers a look back to the 80 's untouched by commercialism .
you will remember the hair 
the music 
and the fashion .
i am the same age as mr. stein ,
so the trip back to memory lane was welcome .
his solo lip-syncing dance number is priceless ,
enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t-shirt.the film deal with dark theme at time .
child abuse 
the holocaust 
nuclear war 
sexual fantasy 
and social dysfunction .
no childhood is completely carefree ,
and the way stein deal with these subject is interesting to say the least 
and hilarious to behold.watch at your earliest convenience !
