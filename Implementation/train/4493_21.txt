i know
nothing of the iliad so can not comment on it is accuracy to that story .
however 
as a stand alone
film i found this very boring .
the battle scene tried to be large and spectacular
but they were just obvious cgi.the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the lady .
but he does not make a good warrior ,
too pretty i am afraid.good point are is the design .
this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings/wall impressive .
i do like a film
that at least try to get the character accent true
but this film just seems to ignore it completely .
we hear american 
scottish english anything
but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation.all in all ,
i do not recommend this film for a family sit down .
it is too long
and the young will get bored.for adult ,
it is ok
if you do not care about the lack realism .
