first of all 
i firmly believe
that norwegian movie are continually getting better .
from the tedious emotional film of the 70 's and 80 's 
movie from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour .
imagine.. actual comedy were made !
movie were actually starting to get entertaining and funny ,
as opposed to long 
dark ,
depressing and boring.during the 90 's and 00 's several really great movie were made by a 'new generation ' of filmmaker .
movie after movie were praised by critic
and played load of money .
it became the norm !
then came united ... *minor spoilers*
it is just simply not funny .
not once .
not ever .
but the thing is ...
we think its funny .
because we are used to norwegian movie
to be funny .
especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedian .
but.. they neither say
nor do anything funny !
where is the humor ?
show me the humor !
is it the awkward clerk
played by harald eia ?
is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach ?
is it the commentary by arne scheie ?
the movie is just not funny !
but thats not my main rant about united .
that namely is the predictability .
( and it is here i fear
that norwegian comedy have come to a standstill
since i have seen this in many other movie as well . )
all the time you just know
its going to end well .
all character are exactly
as they are presented in the start of the movie ,
and everybody gets exactly
what they deserve in the end .
there is absolutely no room for surprise at all !
all in all i can say
that i sat with a bad feeling
after seeing this movie .
it was the one movie
that made me realize
that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie
making ... again !
rating :
1/6
