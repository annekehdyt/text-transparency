this movie started out good ,
i felt
like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld .
much to quickly i started questioning the situation and action of the main character ,
and found no answer to why they were doing
what they were doing .
all the acting was superb
but only a few scene had ief moment
where they were actually funny .
dan cortese was amazing .
i loved him in this role .
his agent should show this movie to casting agent .
watch the first few scene
and then find something better ,
or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess .
i found this in a bin at a video store .
it cost me two dollar and due to the rareness of this movie i feel
like it was a good price .
