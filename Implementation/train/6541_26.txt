this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome.the character development in this film is excellent .
we get to believe
that harry is a businessman
who neglects his family ,
and george is an innocent man
who craves loving and care from the `` normal '' society .
acting is excellent ,
and the canne best actor award is well deserved.the fantasy scene in the film highlights
the fact
that george misery towards his abandonment by his family ,
and his desire
to be treated like a normal person .
the song
that gets played repeatedly
also reinforces this message .
the film shows
that person
who are mentally handicapped
are good natured .
we have been treating them with discrimination and neglect 
a fact
that is highlighted by the scene
where george gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen ) .
if we get to understand and share these person 's world ,
both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy.i was so drawn into the film and the character ' emotional experience .
it is a touching film for good natured soul .
