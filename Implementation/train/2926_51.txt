in the early to mid 1970 's 
clifford irving proposed
to write the ultimate biography of howard hughe ,
claiming to have spent month preparing for the book ,
engaged in interview with the reclusive millionaire .
when all of this turned out to be false ,
irving was accused of perjury and spent several year behind bar
( although always admitting his finding were accurate ) .
flash forward to 20001 
several month prior to september 11th 
a book 
entitled 'forbidden love '
( published in the u.s. as 'honor lost :
love and death in modern day jordan ' )
by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri 
a woman from jordan ,
who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia ,
due to the fact
that dalia ,
being from a devout muslim background ,
was dating a christian man .
it 
like irving 's biography on hughe was revealed as a potential hoax .
australian film maker 
anna broinowski attempt to delve into the quagmire
that was khouri 's attempt to clear herself of the lie
( s ) .
over the time frame of 104 minute 
the film attempt
to reveal
is norma khouri telling the truth ,
or is she just a compulsive liar 
with an agenda/vendetta of her own ? .
interview footage with those
who know/knew her
( including an ex husband 
her publisher 
and other )
tell their side of the story .
this is a toothsome ,
well produced documentary
that manages to point many finger at just as many potential guilty party .
not rated ,
but contains pervasive bad language
and a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene ,
played over a few time
( but nothing nearly as graphic and disturbing
as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic ,
such as saw :
part 84 ) .
not a good choice for the little one .
