time travel is a fun concept ,
and this film gives it a different slant .
i got a kick out of captain billingham 
one of the more down-to-earth character ,
who was just not having a good day .
ordinarily 
i do not choose to watch horror film ,
but this is an exception .
good story 
excellent acting .
