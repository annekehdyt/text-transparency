a famous conductor decide after a heart attack
to go back to the village
where he was born
to live a quiet life .
there 
he comes in dutch with the local church choir ,
that will change his life.i had no expectation
when i saw this movie for the first time yesterday ;
i like watching foreign movie
that are not english ,
and i have already seen a couple of swedish movie in my life ,
but this one was the best so far.where
to start ?
in my opinion 
this film is a jewel 
thank to many thing ,
of which one is the outstanding acting .
michael nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful 
almost shy and devoted conductor daniel dar\u00e9us .
beautiful frida hallgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting .
the choir member are all well-developed 
interesting character with their own story each.this movie tells a story 
a beautiful story 
about music 
love 
pain 
memory 
death 
about a man
who devoted his life to music ,
and who tries to create a calm existence in the village
where he was born ,
while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then .
kay pollack shows us
that the swedish are outstanding movie creator .
go see s\u00e5 som i himmelen ,
it is a movie
that makes you think about life and love ,
and that is also comforting 
in some way .
