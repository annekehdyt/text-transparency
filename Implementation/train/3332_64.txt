deanna durbin 
nan grey and barbara read are `` three smart girl '' in this universal film from 1936 ,
which introduces deanna durbin to film audience .
it also stars ray milland 
mischa auer 
charle winninger 
john king 
binnie barne and alice brady .
it is a sweet story about three young woman ,
now living in switzerland with their divorced mother ,
who hear their father
( winninger )
is marrying again .
not having seen him in 10 year
and knowing their mother still loves him ,
they board a ship to america ,
with the help of the housekeeper/nanny ,
determined to stop the wedding .
realizing that the intended 
called `` precious ''
( barne )
is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother
( brady ) ,
they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count .
this is arranged by their father 's accountant
( king ) .
the man he chooses is a full-time drunk
( auer ) ,
but the girl mistake him for an actual wealthy count
( milland ) .
what a mess.this is a delightful film 
not cloying or overly sugary at all 
with some nice performance 
particularly by auer 
milland 
barne and brady .
the young woman are pretty
and all do good work .
the emphasis 
of course 
is on young durbin ,
who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer .
in fact 
her voice as a youngster is much more
even than it would be as an adult -
she has no trouble with the high note ,
as she did later
on
because she put too much weight in the middle voice .
she sings a delightful `` il bacio '' in a police station.one of the nicest thing about the film is to see the father ,
played by charle winninger ,
not want his child around -
until he sees them and gets to know them .
barne as the gold-digger is not all that young ,
but the girl ' mother looks way up there ,
so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger 
more glamorous woman .
in fact 
he finds
the youth he was seeking in his daughters.universal gives durbin the big star buildup here -
she has the final shot in the movie .
ray milland at this point was still paying his due ,
and it will probably be a surprise even to film fan how young and attractive he is.very entertaining and of course 
this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna .
