welcome to collinwood is one of the most delightful film i
have ever seen .
a superb ensemble cast 
tight editing and wonderful direction .
a caper movie
that does not get bogged down in the standard tricks.not much
can
be said about this film
without spoiling it .
the tag line says
it all - 5 guy .
1 safe .
no brains.william h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast .
george clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem .
