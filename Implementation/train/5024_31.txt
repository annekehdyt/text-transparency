just about everything in this movie is wrong 
wrong 
wrong .
take mike myer 
for example .
he is reached the point
where you realize
that his shtick has not changed since his snl day 
over ten year ago .
he is doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness joke and the same voice .
his cat is painfully unfunny .
he try way to hard .
he is some weird type a comedian ,
not the cool cat he is supposed to be .
the rest of the movie is just as bad .
the set are unbelievably ugly
-- -
and clearly a waste of million of dollar .
( cardboard cut-out for the background building would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street . )
alec balwin try to do a funny great santini impression ,
but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent .
there is even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celeity paris hilton
-- -
that stick in the mind
simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story .
avoid this movie at all cost 
folk .
it is not even an interesting train wreck .
( i hope
they will make horton hears a who with robin william .
then we will have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy . )
