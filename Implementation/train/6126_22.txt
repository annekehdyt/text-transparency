very few chess movie have been made over the last couple of year ,
but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need
to be loved and the need
to win it ,
john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man ,
nothing matter to him accept 64 square and 32 piece 
the game validates him as a person ,
when he looses a game
he looses the one thing
that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion 
even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.it makes you wonder
if there other luzon 's out there
who obsess about the game ,
i am sure
they are ,
if you are a chess enthusiast
it will not hurt to watch it.it an intelligent piece of work
laid out properly
and executed well ,
it achieves its objective ,
unfortunately i doubt
if there will be sequel .
