i got this film about a month ago
and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore 's .
i love a happy
ending and this film gives a illiant one with the truth of red sox slotted in !
it is about a math teacher
who takes some promising kid on a math trip to a company
where the successful lindsey
( drew )
shows them some information .
this then leads in the ben
( teacher )
and lindsey dating .
but it is not all simple
when he confesses
he is a massive red sox fan .
first of all thing are fine
but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life .
it is all fine in the end
and it took one shot
to get drew running across the field ! !
i got it for two quid in blockbuster
so i was happy .
if you like film like this i suggest
you see some more of drew 's work like charlie 's angel and 50 first date or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyric .
