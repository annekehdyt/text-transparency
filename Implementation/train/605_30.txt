this could have been interesting \u0096 a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family \u0096
but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment
and the unsuitability of both cast and director.the film suffer from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare 
i.e .
the fact
that the spirit demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than
that they are expected to !
besides 
it does not deliver much in the scare department \u0096
a giant crab attack is merely silly \u0096 as 
generally 
the ghost inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way 
such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup !
at one point 
an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger
if
they remain there \u0096 eventually ,
he is called upon to exorcise the premise .
however 
history is bound to repeat itself
and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation
duly created \u0096
leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax
in which albert and mcclure 
possessed by the spirit of their japanese predecessor 
engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death !
at the end of the day 
this emerges an innocuous time-waster \u0096 tolerable at just 88 minute but 
in no way 
essential viewing .
