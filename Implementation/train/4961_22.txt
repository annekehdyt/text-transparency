i just saw this film ,
i first saw it
when i was 7
and could just about remember the end .
so i watched it like 
10 minute ago ,
and ( i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha-ha )
i started to cry at the ending ,
i forgotten
how sad it was .
i think
i was mainly sad for anne-marie
because she said :
'i love you charlie ' and also :
'i will miss you charlie ' ,
just made me really cry ha-ha .
it has to be one of me favourite movie of all time ,
it is just a film well worth watching .
watch it ha-ha ,
thats all i can say xdbut ,
i love this film 
its a true classic.xx maverick xx 10/10
