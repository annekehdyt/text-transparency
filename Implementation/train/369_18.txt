by 1955 
five year
after this one was released jame stewart
and anthony mann had completed another six film together 
four of them western .
their rapport was obvious from the outset
and what was intended as little more
than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic .
buff of the period will revel in the fact
that the first ten name on the credit were all more than well known -
and that is not counting ray teal or 'anthony ' curtis ,
later to become tony .
perhaps ten year later the 'psychological ' western was well entrenched
but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel ,
to say
nothing of addressing several other issue along the way ,
and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned .
one to add to the dvd collection .
