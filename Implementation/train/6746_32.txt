she may have an oscar and a golden globe ,
but this film shows why
she also is a perennial razzie nominee .
to do a film
that is so bad
must be an indication
that she needs money .
she could do ad on why you should not talk on a cell phone
while driving 
especially at night on the way to a crowded mall.susan montford should stick to producing
( shoot 'em up )
as she is not very good
as a writer/director.she is accosted by four thug in the mall parking lot ,
and the first thing
they do
is tell her
they have a gun .
what does she do ?
she start pushing and cursing them like she knows martial art or something .
she manages to get away ,
but gets lost in the forest after crashing .
why did not she run to someones house ?
we get four thug with gun
chasing a lady with a toolbox .
of course 
their gun are no match for her wrench .
ha !
of course 
she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver .
those poor thug.now 
she is home for christmas -
and she ought a gun !
