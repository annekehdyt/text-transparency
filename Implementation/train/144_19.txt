i was really looking forward to seeing this film ,
but after watching it i was really disappointed .
the best bit was
when stephen king was in it .
rober john berk can not act to save his life
and neither can any of the other .
a few of the performance even made me laugh out loud !
the film was was not as i imagined it ,
after reading the book
which was awesome ,
i imagined it darker and a lot scarier .
if i was stephen ,
i would be really mad ! i do not know
why they changed the ending ,
i thought
the ending of the book was very good .
if you just found out the pie killed your daughter ,
you would not feed it to anyone else would you ?
! book was so much better !
