when `` girlfight '' came out ,
the review praised it ,
but i did not get around to seeing it .
i finally saw it
when it got released on video ,
and understand
the glowing review.the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto .
we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman
( michelle rodriguez ) .
she has a bad-ass expression on her face ,
and any idea about diana
that we might derive from this expression
soon gets corroborated
when she gets in a fight .
as diana gets in trouble for this ,
we then meet her father 
an aggressive type in his own right ;
clearly we can not totally blame diana for her attitude.but then the movie really picks up 
as a new thought germinate in diana 's mind :
boxing as a way
to escape this grim existence .
her older other has already gotten into boxing ,
but her father most likely will not approve .
only diana herself can decide what to do.just the first few minute alone
identified
that i was in for a very gritty 
non-hollywood movie ,
but the ief appearance of john sayle in a supporting role truly affirmed that .
even before they get to any boxing scene ,
you feel
like you are getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life
that diana life .
and when they finally arrive at the film 's main story ,
there is no turning back.all in all ,
i definitely recommend this movie .
i will admit
that using boxing as a means
to show someone
trying to make something of himself/herself
has been sort of a clich\u00e9 in cinema for many year
( `` rocky '' 
`` million dollar baby '' ) ,
but i still think
that they did a great job with it here .
in fact 
this may have ought the genre to its apex .
really good .
too bad
that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movie
after this one .
