i must preface this
by saying
i am a huge romantic .
hence i really wanted to like this film .
so i am writing
my thought to save the rest of you from the disappointment i felt watching it .
the leap year tells the destiny-filled tale of li-ann
who falls for the suave jeremy
and they commit to meet every leap year .
a very romantic premise ,
based on a great short story and with a cast
that does not feel
like you are watching yet another jack neo flick .
then why oh why is it so bad ?
firstly 
i feel
the filmmaker thought
they were shooting a music video ,
because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotion with cheesy montage 
predictable action and clich\u00e9d line .
i am both upset
and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in singapore to watch the leap year ,
but those of us in the cinema would agree
that our muffled groan at the cringe-worthy performance spoke volume .
my hope was to watch a romantic movie
that would surpass forever fever 
the best singaporean romantic comedy so far ,
and the leap year does not even come close .
some blog have called it the crap year
which is harsh but ultimately true .
do not waste your money or your emotion like i did .
the movie will make you give up on love forever .
