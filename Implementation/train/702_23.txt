i loved it !
fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson 
a somewhat conceited 
proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player
who is in love with maggie
( carole lombard ) ,
who 's always there for him .
they meet in panama
after maggie comes off a ship
and end up in a bar with anthony quinn .
tony gets punched in the nose after her insult maggie
by thinking her a loose woman - all
because she took off her hat in public .
big awl and maggie ends up stuck in panama .
romance .
carole and arthur are great together .
maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her .
she urges him to go to ny where
( well watch the movie and find out ) .
they have these wonderful scene together
where she sings in his arm
while he plays the saxophone .
i definitely recommend it .
