nintendo ! ! !
you # % $ @ ers ! ! !
how could you do this to me ?
i can not believe
it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one .
i went to see this at the theatre with my other
because my mother forced me to tag along ... .oh god ...
where do i even begin ?
the plot sucked .
the voice acting sucked .
the animation sucked .
the ending really sucked .
if you liked this movie ,
you suck too .
and to futuramafan1987 ,
who said
this was the greatest movie ever ,
you are a tool 
plain and simple .
this is not a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year old with game boy
who think
pikachu is god .
i am still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie ... .and
then there was pikachu 's adventure ...
do not even get me started on that horrible mess of a film .
it is 
in all truth 
one of the most boring experience of my entire life .
do not go watch this at any costs.bottom line :
go out 
find every copy of this movie
that you can ,
and burn it .
burn them all ,
and then proceed to rent a good movie 
like alien ... or bowling for columbine ... or even back to the future !
