probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life ,
and i enjoyed it .
the plot is related
of how the young army officer took the power in portugal in 1974 ,
to finally defeat the fascist governmant of caetano
and to also finalize the war in the colony 
i.e .
mozambique 
angola 
and guinea
( bissau )
- cape vert .
most of the event shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officer and soldier
to conduct the coup 
of the oppressed person ,
who were very happy with this new developmant and the liberty 
the resistance of caetano 's man ,
and also in a subtle way of most conservative official ,
including spinola ,
who took over as the new president .
the portuguese revolution can be remembered
because of the action of several young officer ,
but for me the most interesting part of the film was
when the young captain expressed
that portugal should develop itself democratically ,
and this is what the country achieved some year after this coup or revolution .
the film also shows
that the army officer and soldier never wanted to kill anyone ;
even the most serious enemy were respected at the end .
