the view of earth
that are claimed in this film
to have been faked by nasa
have recently been compared with the historical weather datum for the time of apollo 11 ,
and show a good match between the cloud pattern in the video sequence and the actual rainfall record on the day.this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film
that the `` whole earth '' picture is actually a small part of the planet
framed by the spacecraft window.i am waiting for bart siel to now claim
that the historical weather datum has been faked by nasa ,
though that would no doubt
involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map ,
and the one in private hand would still be a problem.ah 
a response :
`` trying to discredit this movie
by referring to nasa weather datum i would say
is a charming 
but weak and gullible argument .
what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie ?
a certain wise man once said
something about sifting mosquito and swallowing camel .
do you in any way feel
that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here ?
: - )
this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim
once made by u.s. government
that the moon-mission were a success ,
and that man now are true master of the universe .
thing are nearly never quite what they seem.. just watch the movie ,
and i dear say
you will see thing a bit different than before .
`` first off 
weather datum does not come from nasa ,
it comes for met agency around the world .
second 
the weather datum undermines a major claim in the film .
third 
far from being `` packed with irrefutable evidence '' ,
the remaining claim in the film have been thoroughly debunked .
siel thought
he had a previously secret piece of film ,
so he edited it
and added his own interpretation .
unfortunately for him 
his source film is public domain ,
and the bit siel edited out contradict his claim .
