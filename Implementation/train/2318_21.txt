another british cinema flag waver .
real garbage on offer here once again .
i can not understand
( and i am british )
why this over the top 
patriotic nonsense was ever made .
eight year mark you ,
from when the second world war had actually ended !
other commenter 's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage .
this is extremely poorly observed .
the archive footage is in abundance .
model aircraft swing from wire in the 'action scene ' like so many child 's kite in the wind .
the usual map room sequence tattoo the movie
to make us
supposedly drawn into the whole malta event .
guinness must have his worst acting performance ever .
the shocking back drop dog fight scene are laughable .
hawkin bores us all to death in the map room area .
ealing made many great movie .
this clearly is not one of them .
they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot !
