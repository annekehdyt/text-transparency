amazing performance from simon pegg
who just gets better and better with every role .
as usual he plays the part of a very cringy character
who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes ,
but thats what pegg is all about.the laugh were regular and eye watering and everyone of them
aimed at penn .
the movie was very cleverly put together
where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn
being the only humour involved
which is a huge credit to the director robert weide.and i can not let this one go
without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson
who shone throughout .
highly recommended to all .
