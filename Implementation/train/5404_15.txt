the only reason
i am bothering to comment on this movie
is to save you all 97 minute of your life
and maybe your money.i bought it ex-rental for \u00a33.00 ,
it looked interesting ,
so i took a chance.within minute
of turning it on i realised i would made a mistake .
the entire cast should be stored away until winter
and then thrown on the nearest log fire ,
where they could meet more of their kind.as for the devin hamilton
( writer and director ) ,
he should just be shot ,
sadly this should have been done
before he made this rubbish.avoid this film ,
if you see it in the shop run away.1/10
