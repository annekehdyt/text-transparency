the movie deserves 2/10 .
1.5 star for the girl ,
( i am sorry i am biased ,
i think
pretty girl is the only highlight of the movie ) ,
and 0.5 for the fact
that it is shorter than azumi 1. i
watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating .
i amazed myself being able to sit through it .
let talk about the plus point of the movie .
the girl .
ueto aya is cute .
that all there is to salvage the whole movie .
the fact is ,
if the main character was male ,
i am sure that most person
( including me )
would not have touched the movie at all .
now let talk about the minus point .
firstly 
it is real draggy 
with lot and lot of repeated scene .
scene of nachi and azumi keep coming back .
it seems more like a drama way of shooting .
typical japanese dramas love flashback 
and this movie too .
secondly 
the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting .
i do not mind unrealistic movie .
but this movie is like a poor way
of showing creativeness 
by throwing in ninjas
that act like bear and spider webs ,
etc ...
it reminds me of shinobi ,
though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting .
moreover ,
to portray `` i-do not-know '' what effect ,
the director films person dying with blood spraying
( literally )
all around ... person
not realizing their head was cut off ... etc.. etc ... etc ... too many of these spoil the show .
it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie .
it degrades the show greatly .
thirdly 
is not azumi supposed to be an assassin .
she seems more like an one-man-army to me ,
just
that she is a female .
i do not think you see assassin
charging into army camp .
the only time i felt
she acted `` assassin-liked '' was
when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1. lastly ,
the plot was thin in both movie .
its a linear plot with no development
and surprise in any way .
