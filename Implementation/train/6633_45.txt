this film should have been fun .
a young lea thompson 
a young joaquin phoenix ... and terry o'quinn .
in space .
but it dragged on ,
had unlovable character
and had no target audience.some kid go to a space camp
and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of their
( named 
appropriately 
jinx ) .
the space scene are then long 
repetitive
( the same accident happens twice )
and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view .
adult will be bored and cheesed out ,
kid might be scared as the way
this was filmed
really leaves an eerie sense about it.there is a budding romance ,
but unlike the shuttle
-- this never takes off .
why it is included in the first place
is unclear ,
except maybe to add extra tension between the character -
but it failed
if that was the idea.a young lea thompson
should be quirky and attractive 
right ?
i mean 
`` back to the future '' is great .
but no 
she was irritating and average-looking .
not someone
you would want to date ,
have as a friend or even consider as a role model .
joaquin phoenix ?
he is really lucky
he ever appeared in movie again this performance .
maybe he can act like mikey in the life cereal commercial ,
but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy .
he does not fit in on screen
and i do not think
we can identify with him at home .
i actually would have been happier
if he had never returned to earth.i do not recommend this film to anyone .
