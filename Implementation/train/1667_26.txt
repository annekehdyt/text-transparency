i have read many negative review of this movie
and finally got a chance
to see it on dvd .
to be honest i
really do not know what the problem with it is.it is a decent murder mystery thriller ,
shown from various point of view 
from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspect ,
including the late porn king 
john holme .
please read the plot synopsis for the exact detail of the movie 's plot -
i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.many reviewer
went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence
but i really do not see it .
many modern movie were worse -
saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie ,
which often relies on implied blood stain than actual utal slaying
( the murder
depicted in this film
were done with lead pipe 
afterall )
.i was enthralled with both half of the movie -
the first showing john holme as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict ,
and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath .
the movie has excellent acting ,
even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality.the soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70 's b-side rock and obscure pop ,
spread out over a couple of hour in all the right place ala boogie night .
