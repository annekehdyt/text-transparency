yet another insult and slap in the face to gay man everywhere .
this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommand it .
once again we have an attractive 'straight ' hero
who supposedly can not get any woman
to be interested in him .
yeah 
right !
and we are also presented with the 'sympathetic 
attractive ' gay friend
who is actually a fat 
balding 
ugly old man
whom the lead
is supposed to find attractive .
even i did not find him appealing and i am a fat 
ugly old gay man
( but thankfully not balding ) !
whatever acting talent
there may be here
has been thrown away on a bad script ,
and truly awful direction .
mr. sneedeker should be banned from filmdom ,
but then he is no different than the countless other hack
working in hollyweed .
