i grew up watching the original tv series in the sixty and one thing
that i can tell you right away ,
there is no comparison .
this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit
that was alive .
a martian
that took different shape .
special effect
that looked like something
that a little child would create .
in contrast 
in the original 
character were developed
and the viewer developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin .
the only highlight in this film 
yes 
actually there was one ,
occurred
when ray walston finally made an appearance at the end .
he wore dark glass
and made reference to living on this planet for 30 year as a sort of homage to the tv series .
but even the real uncle martin could not save this turkey .
