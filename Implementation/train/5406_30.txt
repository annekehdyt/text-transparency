no mention
if ann river siddon adapted the material for `` the house next door '' from her 1970s novel of the same title ,
or someone
else did it .
this lifetime-like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough .
having read the book a long time ago ,
we decided to take a chance
when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie
made for television .
you know
that
when the critical moment precede the commercial ,
which of course ,
one can not find in this version
we watched.the film 's star is lara flynn boyle
who sport a new look
that threw this viewer a curve
because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through .
from the new eyeow to other part of her body 
ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy 
the character at the center of the mystery .
this was not one of the actress better moment in front of the camera .
that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actor
that deserved better.the film has a feeling of a cross between `` desperate houswife '' with `` the stepford wives ''
and other better known feature ,
combined with a mild dose of creepiness .
the best thing
about the movie
was the house
which serves as the setting .
