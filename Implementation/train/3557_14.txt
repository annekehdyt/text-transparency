this is the third parody of the scary movie and hopefully the last .
this time the spoof is mainly on the ring 
sign and 8 mile for some weird reason .
in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny .
i laughed maybe three time
and that is not enough for a comedy .
i really enjoyed the first two
but this one was just plain dumb .
if your joke consist of corpse getting beat up
and person constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you .
in my opinion ,
if your smart enough stay at home
and save your money and please stop making these kind of movie ,
they just keep getting worse 3/10 .
