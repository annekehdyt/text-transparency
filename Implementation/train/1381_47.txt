this movie was awful .
the ending was absolutely horrible .
there was no plot to the movie whatsoever .
the only thing
that was decent about the movie
was the acting done by robert duvall and jame earl jone .
their performance were excellent !
the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performance any justice .
if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story ,
it would be worth watching .
instead 
robert duvall 's and jame earl jone ' performance are completely wasted on a god awful storyline ... or lack thereof .
not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something
to happen
to make the movie ...
.well an actual movie ... not just utterless dialog between character for what ended up being absolutely no reason .
it was nothing more than common dialog
that would have taken place back in that period of time .
there was nothing special about any of the character .
the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling 
senile 
drunk 
old man .
nothing worthy happens during the entire movie
including the end .
when the movie ended ,
i sat amazed ... amazed
that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest
to happen to make watching the movie worth while .
it never happened !
the cast of character suddenly started rolling making it apparent
that the movie really was over
and i realized
that i had just wasted 2 hour of my life
watching a movie
with absolutely no plot and no meaning .
it was not even a story .
the entire movie takes place in a day 's worth of time .
that is it .
it was one day in the life
( and death )
of some southerner on a plantation .
how much of a story can take place in a single day
( other than the movie training day ) ?
the acting performance by the entire cast were excellent ,
but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie ...
if you can even call it a movie .
