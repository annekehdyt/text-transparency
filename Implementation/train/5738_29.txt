this one hearkens back to the day of the matin\u00e9e ,
when kid with nowhere else to hang out took their date to the balcony
after dumping their younger sibling below .
it did not matter what was on the screen -
the little kid would sit through it
and the big kid would ignore it .
the adult 
of course 
would never see it.but
they put it on video 
anyway 
along with most of the other creaky 
low-budget `` b '' horror flick of the golden age ... of television .
this film 's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology
( the `` bad girl '' harvested
to replace poor jan 's crushed body -
they had it comin ' ) ,
overused plot
( a mad scientist ,
trying to play god ) ,
violent yet conscientious monster
( whose presence in the heretofore-normal-seeming scientist 's rural lab is never fully explained ) ,
and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top.this is a great party film ,
assuming
your guest enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploit .
in fact 
should you or your guest prefer more passive entertainment ,
this film is also available on video in its `` mystery science theater 3000 '' treatment ,
in which the host and puppet of the cult tv series make the necessary addition for you .
