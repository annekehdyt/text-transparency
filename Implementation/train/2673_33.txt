i just rented this today ... .heard lot of good review beforehand .
wow ! !
what a pile of steaming poo this movie is ! !
does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollar back ? ? ? ?
finally someone bumped `` stop-loss '' from the 'worst iraq war movie ever ' number one spot .
to be fair ,
i do not think
there are any good iraq war movie anyway ,
but this was really bad .
i will not get into any technical inaccuracy ,
there is a hundred review from other gwot vet
that detail them all .
if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest e-nothing about technical accuracy
however they could have made the movie somewhat realistic ... .maybe .
i guess
the writer should be given the `` credit '' for this waste of a film .
he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraint of reality .
does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was ?
was there a message ?
seriously though ... ..wtf ? ? ?
? i am pretty amazed at all the positive review really .
this film is hard to watch as a vet
because of all the glaring inaccuracy
but even if one could overlook
that 
the plot suck 
character are shallow
( to say the least )
and the acting is poor at best .
it is ironic 
i suppose ,
that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal ,
because it is the biggest bomb i have seen this year .
