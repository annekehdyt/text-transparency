apparently ruggero deodato figured out 
early on ,
that his story would not work
if he approached it too seriously ,
so he decided to camp it up .
the result is a film
that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy !
and i think
i will go the second way .
the ief gore moment are well-done ,
the paul brothers openly mock the material
( they even bark at each other in one scene !
) ,
and there is also a charming 
spirited 
good-natured performance by eva la rue 
as the girl
who tags along with the `` boys '' .
plus ,
where else can you see the inside of a dragon lighted like a discotheque ? ?
