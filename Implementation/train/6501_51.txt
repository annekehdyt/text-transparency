this is a collection of documentary
that last 11 minute 9 second and 1 frame from artist all over the world .
the documentary are varied
and deal with all sort of concept ,
the only thing
being shared
is 9/11 as a theme
( very minor in some case ) .
some of the segement are weak
while other are very strong ;
some are political ,
some are not ;
some are solely about 9/11 ,
some simply use 9/11 as a theme
to touch on human feeling 
emotion and tragedy
that are universal ;
some are mainstream
while other are abstract and artistic ) .
this film has not been censored in any fashion
by anyone so the thought
that you see are very raw and powerful.this
is a very controversial film 
especially for conservative american .
i think
two segment might really tick off the right winger
( one from egypt
where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirit ;
another from uk
which recounts the us-backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 
1973 ,
which resulted in 50,000 death and horrible atrocity ) .
the segment from mexico was the most powerful 
recounting the fall of the tower and the resulting death in vivid fashion
( you have to see it to believe it )
.even
though the final product is uneven ,
with some segment being almost `` pointless '' ,
i still recommend this .
it is very difficult to rank this film
because the segment vary all over the place
( some weak 
some very powerful ; ) .
i am giving this a rating of 9/10
simply
because some segment were excellent and covered issue
that usually get censored
( mexico segment 
uk segment 
japan segment 
egypt segment ) .
