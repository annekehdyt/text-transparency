i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made .
both stand out in my mind
because unlike early star trek series 
there is a consistent evolution of plot and character .
if you look at the original star trek and star trek :
tng 
they were fine show ,
but there was no overall theme or plot
that connected all the episode .
in many way 
you could usually watch the show totally out of sequence with no difficulty
understanding what is occurring .
this was less the case with deep space 9
( with its giant battle
that took up all of the final season )
and the other trek show ,
as there was more of a larger story
that unified them .
this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5
and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1 .
the bottom line is that in many way this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form .
sure 
there were a few `` throwaway '' episode
that were not connected to the rest ,
but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.and speaking of funny ,
i loved
that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time
and was not so dreadfully serious .
in this way 
i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5. jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson
-- it is really too bad
he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.to truly appreciate sg-1 ,
you should watch it from the beginning
and see how intricately the plot work .
this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power .
and 
if you do not like sg-1
after giving it a fair chance ,
then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you .
