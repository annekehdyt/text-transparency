i have had a thing for this kari chick for a while ,
and as far
as how she looked in this movie 
no complaint .
but after catching it last night in high definition ,
i am certain :
that is the only thing in the movie
that is not substandard .
the script is horrible ,
the acting is horrible ,
the direction is horrible .
i saw in another comment
someone commenting on how great the sex scene were ... what ?
not at all .
when a movie is this bad you might
as well just turn it into softcore porn ,
but instead i get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing wuhrer 's body and scene
that offer me nothing except a tease .
they should have just gone cinemax so
that the movie was not a complete waste of time 
but no .
with a script this awful they should have capitalized on wuhrer 's look ,
since that is the lone pro of the movie .
2/10 
only because she looked so hot .
