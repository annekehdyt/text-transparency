example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made ,
using first hand account from actual troop and civilian
whom participated in this awful conflict ,
and archived footage gathered from around the time .i caught this on a re-run on the history channel about a year and a half back 
with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time ,
but it enveloped me ,
and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff ,
watching and reading any and all
that i can find about it ,
but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary ,
definitely worth buying the boxed set of ... ... ... ... .this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard .
