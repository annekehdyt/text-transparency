i thought
this movie was wonderfully plotted
it made me confused and my cousin
who watched it with me.to tell the truth i think
that the younger kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ...
but i also thought
the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death '' i was inside you ''
.i think
that is what she gets for doing what she did with him
and how is he going to tell her
that she is too young
when he never cared how old the other girl were .
? now i do not think
i myself could ever trust a cop like that.but to tell the truth
it was pretty obvious
it was him
even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way.and
that was funny
when she sprayed him in the eye in the store.hahahahaha.she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself
and so was the cop
who died hello ! !
it is called back-up.sometime these movie make me mad
when person act stupid and do stupid things.but
that is what i think an thought about the movie .
