as far as spaghettus western go ,
i would put this man can not die on the dull side of the genre .
it is not that the movie is particularly bad ,
but it lacks the illiance and flash of some of the other sws i have seen .
guy madison does his best in the lead role ,
but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary
to pull it off .
with one notable exception 
the rest of the cast is not particularly good .
the direction is uninspired and offers very few moment
that i have not seen before .
there is just not much to get very excited
about.the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri .
she is the one ight spot in this otherwise mediocre film .
unfortunately 
her screen time is limited to less than 15 minute .
( note :
the imdb page for this man can not die is wrong .
rosalba neri does not play jenny benson .
instead 
she is the character melin .
i am not sure
how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy
named john bartha
as listed in imdb 's credit for the movie . )
