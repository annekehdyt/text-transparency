i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission ,
and let me tell you ,
you will watch anything under those circumstance .
not this piece of sh*t though.the first five minute set the tone by weak porn-movie quality acting ,
weird out-of-the-blue plot twist and unbelievable situation and behavior .
it gets worse after that .
this movie does not have one single saving grace ,
and yet it is not bad in a way
that would make it funny to watch .
it is just horrible .
i have seen quite many movie in my life and i am not one of those snobby know-all critic ,
i mean i will enjoy most movie to some extent
even if they are bad .
this one ... man.steer _well_ clear of this one 
my friend .
