considering the potential
this move had ,
the reality was disappointing .
while it is always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie ,
even that could not turn this around .
most of the action was predictable .
the joke were flat to mildly amusing .
and the character were not very interesting .
i wanted to like this film ,
but it just never happened .
ben stiller was hilarious in `` there is something about mary '' .
here
it looks like he
is just going thru the motion .
if they have to lift plot point from `` friend '' ,
they should have known something was wrong .
the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet :
- )
.watch `` 50 first date '' instead .
