this is probably one of the most original love
story i have seen for age 
especially for a war based
( iefly )
film .
basically it is a story
based in two world ,
one obviously real 
the other fictitious
but the filmmaker say at the beginning
that it is only coincidence
if it is a real place .
anyway 
peter carter
( the great david niven )
was going to crash in a plane ,
he talked to june
( planet of the apes ' kim hunter )
before he bailed out
and said
he loved her .
he was meant to die from jumping
without a parachute ,
but somehow he survived ,
and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh .
this other place 
like a heaven 
is unhappy
because he survived and was meant to come to their world ,
so they send french conductor 71
( marius goring )
to persuade him to go ,
but he is obviously in love .
peter suggests to him
that he should appeal
to keep his life to the other world 's court ,
he is granted this .
obviously love prevail
when the two lover announce
that they would die for each other 
june even offers to take his place !
also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe 
kathleen byron as an angel 
a ief
( then unknown )
lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and aaham sofaer as the judge/the surgeon .
david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actor ,
the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerker for the happy ending ,
it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war film ,
it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british film ,
and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest film .
outstanding !
