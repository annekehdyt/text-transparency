i will give it a 3 just
because it showed history
that we need to know about ,
to prevent it from happening again .
i agree with the comment from the gentleman from uk .
the movie was pretty terrible .
all clich\u00e9 
no real plot .
historical and technical inaccuracy abound .
look up the technical specs on de 529 
or any evert class destroyer escort ,
and you will see what i mean .
i now its black history month in the us ,
and im going to be called a racist just for saying this ,
but the history of this ship is not that great .
they did some escort work 
chased a `` submarine ''
that turned out to be a hulk
that they rammed .
sorry 
but black person did a lot more in wwii
then this silly movie gives them credit for .
this movie makes them look like whiner .
let the name calling commence ,
i can handle it .
