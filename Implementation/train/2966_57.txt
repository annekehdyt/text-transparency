mary pickford
( `` born on the fourth of july '' as angela moore )
is `` the little american ''
( of french heritage ) ;
she falls in love with jack holt
( as karl von austreim ) ,
who had moved to america with his german father and american mother .
french-american raymond hatton
( as count jule de destin of the `` fighting destin '' )
has fallen in love with ms. pickford .
the love triangled threesome eventually wind up in france 
with the great war
( world war i 
in hindsight )
complicating their life considerably.a mostly entertaining ,
if propagandistically flawed 
cecil b. demille film .
the torpedoing 
and sinking 
of a ship
carrying pickford is `` titanic '' -like .
the war intrigue gets dramatic
as pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for france ,
while the german occupy her ancestral home .
of course 
german lover holt arrives .
it was difficult to believe
they took so long to recognize each other
as he moved in for the rape ,
but it was dark ;
and 
prior event had them believe each other dead .
the film goes way over-the-top in its symbolism .
pickford was 
by the way 
canadian - though 
few could deny
she was not a `` little american '' 
for all intent and purposes.fun to spot `` extra ''
who later became major star include wallace beery 
colleen moore 
and ramon novarro - especially 
watch for mr. novarro exhibiting `` star '' quality during one of the film 's more memorable sequence :
pickford and the wounded soldier saluting each other
as he is taken by her on a stretcher .
novarro even gets mary pickford to write a letter for him ;
obviously 
he is got a future in picture .
also future-bound is ben alexander ,
who plays the boy `` bobby '' ;
he becomes a dependable child actor ,
and grows up to become a jack webb partner on `` dragnet '' .
