william h. macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father
who wants to step out of the family business
without angering his overbearing parent .
tread much of the same territory as tv 's `` the sopranos '' in term of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme
( here too he visits a shrink )
but is still worth watching thank to some taut direction from brommel
( i look forward to what this guy directs next ) ,
an excellent script 
and all around great performance .
macy is excellent as always .
this is probably his best role since `` fargo . ''
donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father .
tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macy 's wife .
young david dorfman is excellent as macy 's ight and sensitive son
( many of his line sound ad-libbed and are wonderful ) .
even neve campell
( who i usually find abhorrent )
is compelling as the troubled young woman
who captures macy 's eye .
all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace
that lead up to a predictable
but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath .
this film deserved a much wider release ,
as i suspect
it would have connected with audience .
