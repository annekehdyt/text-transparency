prot\u00e9g\u00e9 runs in a linear fashion ;
expect no fast-paced action ,
and neither will you find yourself with baited eath
because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments.there is not much of a crux ,
so do not expect one either .
i would not fault the acting -
the show would have been much worst if not for wu 's acting
which was the film 's only saving grace .
and 
oh
that cute little girl too.the humour is at best 
weak ,
and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign
which employs the usual shock-tactic
( esp in the scene with zhang )
to tell us stuff
that we already know - i.e .
drug eak up family ,
heroin drife you crazy ,
it is not so easy
to wean off ,
you will fall into a vicious cycle.i know
it may seem all a little harsh 
but i feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy
( *spoiler alert* :
take for example
when andy lau got ought to the police station :
what ?
we were just told 'oh we have all the tape and evidence against you since 1997 ' ,
and that is how he got caught .
nope 
no chasing-car action 
just a jump-of-scene ,
which kind of undermined wu 's role as an undercover in the first place . )
i suspect
the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact
that it is after all ,
a production of mediacorp raintree - a singaporean production film company .
