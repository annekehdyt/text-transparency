i have seen mystery man cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public
( take the imdb vote for instance ) ,
but my overall feeling is that mystery man is more fun than most film 
definitely wittier than most so-called comedy film
and very nearly 'clever'.the cast is superb ;
greg kinnear is excellent ,
as are geoffrey rush and tom wait .
kinnear 's limo scene with ricky jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star '
and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism
to make him work.i will admit
the pacing is a little off in place ,
and visual are certainly very flash bang 
possibly to the detrimant of further characterisation 
but at the end of the day 
this is high concept film
making - it is about the little momants `` what is up tiger lily ? ''
- and there are so many great one in this film
to make it worth
repeated viewing .
