this is one of the best movie i
have ever seen .
it has very good acting by hank 
newman ,
and everyone else .
definitely jude law 's best performance .
the cinematography is excellent ,
the editing is about as good ,
and includes a great original score
that really fits in with the mood of the movie .
the production design is also a factor
in what makes this movie special .
to me 
it takes a lot to beat godfather ,
but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest .
definitely a best picture nominee in my book .
