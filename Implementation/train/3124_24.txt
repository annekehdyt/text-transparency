the guy
who wrote ,
directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash
should really consider a carer change .
yes rob stefaniuk 
i mean you !
seriously ,
who funded this crap ?
there are so many talented writer out there
whom money could be better spent on .
i think
the idea is great but the acting 
script and directing is just plain awful !
the joke are so not funny ,
i understand
that they are supposed to be taking the mickey .
but do it with style ,
this movie is screaming 1995 saturday night live skit .
why 
i say again
why do studio give money to hack like rob stefaniuk -
never give a comedian the opportunity
to write direct and star in his own movie .
duh !
