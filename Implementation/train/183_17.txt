i am a huge fan of simon pegg
and have watched plenty of his movie until now
and none of them have ceased to make me laugh .
neither did how to lose friend and alienate person.this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing person off .
however 
he has an innate set of ethic
that prevents him from doing thing
that might just make him famous .
but in the end
he ends up doing them ,
the culture of life.the movie is well toned with humor 
romance 
good acting and also a bit of a lap dance .
its one of those movie
where you
could just be happy
when it ends .
