nell shipman attempted a plot
to lead up to a chase finale in 'back to god 's country ' of the previous year ,
and she failed miserably .
this time 
she does better ,
although it seems pointless .
'something new ' hardly has a plot
lying outside of the chase .
there is a ief premise ,
which sets up the hero
( co-author and shipman 's boyfriend )
to have to save the girl
( played by shipman ) ,
then it is nothing but an exciting 
implausible chase from there .
of course 
it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a maxwell sedan ,
but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous .
it does not seem
that she learned much from the last-minute rescue film of d.w. griffith or its parody by mack sennett and other comedian ,
which she is imitating.one point of interest
is that shipman write and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film 's story ,
which has as its protagonist a writer
( shipman again ) ,
although she does not do much else clever or humorous with it ,
even though she attempts to .
again 
other had pioneered the writer 's joke in the intertitle 
like anita loos with 'wild and woolly ' or france marion with 'a girl 's folly '
( both 1917 ) .
at least 
shipman gives the impression
that she does not take herself or the film seriously
-- and neither do i .
'something new 
'
despite its claim ,
is hackneyed .
