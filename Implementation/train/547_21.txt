as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saint 
i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religion 's history .
i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my son and the other young man and woman as well as their family of our ward .
on a beautiful spring evening 
we drove to kirtland ,
ohio to the church 's historical village located there .
we were to have had reservation at the vistor 's center to view this movie .
since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documantaries ,
i was intrigued .
the only `` full length motion picture '' of the church 's i had seen was `` legacy '' and `` my best two year '' ,
both which i thought were very well written and preformed.at the beginning ,
the missionary interpretor passed out tissue
stating
that several person had been deeply moved to the point of tear by this movie .
i thought `` ok ...
but it takes a lot to move me to tear . ''
imagine my surprise
when i found myself sobbing !
it truly is a very moving and inspirational testamant to the prophet joseph smith.see it
and believe
in it is powerful message !
