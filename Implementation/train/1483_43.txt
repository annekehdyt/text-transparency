composed 
elegant carol
( marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke ) ,
her nice husband eddie
( likable david houseman ) ,
carol 's wacky 
constantly eating best gal pal anna
( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan ) ,
and anna 's hunky 
amorous husband pete
( a typically fine eric edward )
are a quartet of liberated swinger
who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other .
their usual routine gets disrupted
when carol 's lonely 
repressed 
but still alluring widow mother jennifer
( a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welle )
drop by for a visit .
pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swinger ' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle 
with everyone
except carol eager to seduce her .
writer/director joe sarno concocts a sharp 
engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitation of the whole wild'n'easy 70 's sexual revolution ;
sarno turns traditional middle class more on their head
and further spice thing up with a bold and provocative mother/daughter incest subplot .
moreover 
sarno elicit uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast :
welle and brooke are both exceptional 
with excellent support from edward 
jordan 
houseman 
arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara 
and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs. field .
better still 
all the woman are extremely hot and enticing ;
welle in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence .
the sex scene are really sizzling and fairly explicit ,
but never raunchy or tedious .
stephen colwell 's ight 
polished cinematography and jack justis ' bouncy 
melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective .
recommended viewing for sarno fan .
