i was required to watch the movie for my work ,
so i did not pay for it
( on the contrary ,
i got paid ) ,
but i still found the movie to suck far more than average .
the joke were lame 
the two lead actress ... well ,
to use the `` first wives club '' division of woman 's age in hollywood ,
they are no longer in their `` hot chick '' age but more in their `` district attorney '' age .
what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line ,
which pretty much completely plagiarized `` beavis and butthead do america ''
( in which the boy are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to `` do his wife '' ,
not realizing they are expected to assassinate her ) .
all in all 
a bland piece of crap .
