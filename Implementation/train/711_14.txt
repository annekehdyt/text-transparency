the various nudity scene
that other reviewer referred to are poorly done
and a body double was obviously used .
if ms. pacula was reluctant to do the scene
herself perhaps
she should have turned down the role
offer.otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movie .
as other reviewer have pointed
out canadian movie are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value ,
which is what most movie watcher are hoping to get .
perhaps canadian movie producer are consciously trying to `` de-commercialize '' their movie
but they have forgotten a very important thing
- movie by definition
are a commercial thing ... .
