okay 
so i get it .
we are supposed to be horrified .
the idea has been planted .
a girl is doing her dad
and taking photo of it .
call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act
before i can fall for this .
but do not expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified
that she is 'doing her father ' ...
i mean has not that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry
already infiltrated with 'rape ,
and molestation ' porn ... horror is not what your mind can fool you into believing .
it is what actually exists in film .
this is where miike fails in visitor q. extremism becomes mild
when it becomes a choose your own adventure .
