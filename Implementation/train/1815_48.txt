bonfire of the vanity is a film drenched in flop sweat .
i can recall no film
that has tried so hard
to be so unrelentingly outrageous 
provocative and important 
yet failed
so consistently across the board .
it is like a stand up comic
who 's not getting laugh ,
but can not leave the stage .
the harder the film try 
the louder each attempt at a laugh result in a resounding thud .
the desperation the film display is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.the film achieve laugh-out-loud status only twice .
once is in the sight of geraldo rivera
playing an obnoxious 
arrogant and amoral tv tabloid journalist
-- which is funny only
because he apparently does not realize
he is playing himself .
the other scene
that deserves to be laughed at
is the film 's final `` big moment 
''
wherein the judge
played by morgan freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality
is ( `` it is what your mama taught ya ! `` ) .
the pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point
of being absurd .
yet 
one must admit
it is a noble effort .
it does have a good ,
if poorly cast 
band of actor ,
who try to make character out of cardboard thin caricature .
the film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourish
that director brian depalma just love are apparent ,
if not particularly effective .
but the film ,
which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern moral and ethic ,
never arises above the level of cartoon .
satire requires style .
farce requires energy .
even sitcom requires timing .
but the best bonfire can muster is desperation .
in the end 
you do not want to laugh ,
you just want to turn away .
