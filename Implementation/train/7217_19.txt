well 
there is no real plot to speak of ,
it is just an excuse
to show some scene of extreme violence and gratuitous sex
( which can sometimes be fun 
too ,
but it is not in this case ) .
what else can i say about this ... ?
the action 
when happening 
is inventive
and there is a cool scene
where two character are falling from a skyscraper
( one
that has to be several mile high ) ,
but overall there is not much to recommend `` kite '' .
watch it if you want ,
but you are not missing much
if you skip this one ...
