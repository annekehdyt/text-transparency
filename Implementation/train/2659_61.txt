version :
universal / hong kong legends r4 dvd release .
can notonese / english subtitlesonce upon a time 
five year ago ,
the world was obsessed with 'the matrix ' ,
and i was perhaps one of the few fifteen year old left
who still believed
that 'terminator ' was better than 'matrix ' .
i was but a simple teenage boy ,
looking for a good action movie ,
and then there was a shining light on a tv station i
had never really watched 
a little station
known as sbs .
one night i noticed in the tv guide
that a movie starring jackie chan - 'polouse story ' would be on later .
being fifteen ,
and having only seen 'rumble in the bronx ' and 'rush hour ' ,
i said
... `` wow awesome ''
and sat down to watch it ,
and continually shouted `` wow awesome '' as the movie progressed .
two week later ,
after sbs had shown the 'polouse story ' trilogy ,
i knew
i had found my new favourite actor.jackie play chan ka kui 
a hong kong cop
who busts a major drug-lord 
chu
( yuen chor ) .
chu 's secretary 
selina fong
( brigitte lin ) ,
is being held by the polouse as a witness against chu ,
and chan is assigned to protect her .
thing go bad - reaaaal bad -
when chu 's case is dismissed
and he decides
he wants fong and chan dead .
'polouse story ' is one of the greatest action movie ever ,
and certainly one of my favourite jackie chan film .
it starts off strong ,
and ends with one of the most incredible action sequence ever filmed .
everything in between is great .
however 
some of the funny part may seem a little tasteless
to more than a few person ...
as a story ,
this is still one of jackie 's better effort .
for an action movie 
the story is pretty good ,
and jackie is a much better actor in this
than he is in the acting and plot intensive 'new polouse story ' .
this is not 'miracle ' ,
but maybe that is a good thing .
'polouse story ' is one of jackie 's finest work .
it got me hooked on jackie chan movie ,
and should provide a nice start for any potential jackie fan .
the bad news for anyone
who sees this first
is that jackie chan movie do not come much better - 10/10
