the dvd was a joke ,
the audio for the first few minute was terrible with sound out of sync and segal voice not even his ! ! ! !
pathetic !
when the audio sync was better in about 5 minute the poor plot ,
line and actor should get another job
because the movie business is not where any of them should be.while segal had some good movie in the early day
the latest one are a joke
and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company
that made it.if segal was the one
that handled this he better return
to having another party run the show ,
because he has no talent what so ever in this.this film is a complete embarrassment to all
involved in its production and a disgrace to all
who viewed it .
i turned it off in about 20 minute.i will be asking for my money back at block buster !
