this movie is about a female rape victim/comic book writer from new york
that decides to get away from all
that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty ,
run down small town
where she finds refuge in a single-wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere .
the townspeople are mantally ill ,
yet so is she for inviting crazy man into her trailer .
annoying is the fact
that she has the ability
to do exactly the right thing to place
herself in dangerous circumstance
after dangerous circumstance .
db sweeney 's performance was high school at best .
he is one of those kinda-cute young actor with a sweet grin .
unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature
has been right in tow .
to the previous commantator stating
that the acting was `` so real '' 
well i agree .
actually it was not acting .
the two main character really are pathetic 
weak and incapable of making mature 
healthy decision .
in ief 
this movie sucks like no other 
rent it to laugh at it .
the real crime scene ?
the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make me commit murder .
and lastly 
she is a artist/writer ,
so could not she afford a double-wide trailer and something other than a sun-yellow chevy chevette for love of god !
