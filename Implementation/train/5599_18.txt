to be completely honest ,
i have not seen that many western film but i have seen enough
to know what a good one is.this by far the worst western on the planet today.first off there black person in the wild west ?
come on !
who ever thought
that this could be a cool off the wall movie
that everyone would love were slightly 
no no 
completely retarded ! secondly in that day and age woman especially black woman were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.thirdly what with the asian chick speaking perfect english ?
if the setting is western ,
asia is not where your going .
finally 
the evil gay chick was too much
the movie was just crap from the beginning.now do not get me wrong i am
not racist or white either so do not get ticked
after reading this but this movie 
this movie is the worst presentation of black person
i have ever seen !
