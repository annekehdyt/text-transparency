***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** juggernaut is a british made `` thriller ''
released in the us by first national .

and start up a medical practice .
he is propositioned by a conniving woman
who wants to get rid of her much older husband .
she knows
karloff needs the money.karloff agrees to the proposition
and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband .
all the while 
the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy .
karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison
and he kicks off .
however 
his son
( from another marriage )
arrives a few day before the killing
and finds out
the will has been changed .
when he spills the bean to the wife ,
she goes berserk
and even bites the son 's hand.meanwhile ,

he asks the wife to poison the son .
the nurse suspect karloff
and finds the missing hypo .
analysis show poison

as karloff kidnaps the nurse.to make a long story short ,
the nurse escape 
gets the police ,
and manages to save the son
who is about to be injected by karloff .
karloff instead injects himself and dies.this movie does have some good point .
karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor
he did in the devil command and the man
who lived again .
it is peculiar 
however ,
to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over .
we never find out why
he is walking this way .
i suspect the director thought
it made him more sinister.the actress
playing the 2-timing wife overact something terrible .
she has a french accent .
even though she overact badly ,
you still manage to hate her
( or maybe you hate her
because of her acting ... )
.a little below average for a karloff vehicle .
if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy ,
the audio is a bit choppy .
