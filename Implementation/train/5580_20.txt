i am a big fan of cinema verite
and saw this movie
because i heard
how interesting it was .
i can honestly say
it was very interesting indeed .
the two lead actor are awesome ,
the film is not ever boring ,
and the concept behind it
( though obviously inspired by the columbine killing and the home movie of the killer )
is really interesting .
there are some weakness 
such as the final 20 minute
which really detracts from the realism
seen in the first hour or so
and the ending really does not make any sense at all .
the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction ,
but in cinema verite that is a given .
but i still think
the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit .
