i always look forward to this movie
when its on tv .
have to get the dvd i guess .
the range of different type of person is great .
it says to me that anyone can be a dancer
if they try hard enough .
my favorite character must be mr.aoki .
he is so quirky but so full of emotion .
it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing .
unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool .
would make for the perfect sequel if
they had .
but i guess
it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.a very simple and innocent story .
he stays loyal to his wife
and daughter.i have not seen the hollywood remake .
not sure if i want to .
i do not really enjoy jennifer lopez .
i think
richard gere more match the original than lopez .
i have a feeling
that the remake is not as simple and innocent .
