imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy
that a one man spends 8 year 's of his life ,
and has a mental eakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself !
the murder technique is clear ,
but a government unwilling to admit the truth let 's a monster destroy dozen of life .
when i think
my job is stressful ,
i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick .
the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea .
the comic
( and almost tragic at time )
relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movie of the last 5 year .
the catching of one of the worst mass murderer in history had me on the edge of my seat .
while not nearly as well advertised
and talked about as `` silence of the lamb 's '' ,
the plot was just as suspenseful .
rent or buy this movie today !
