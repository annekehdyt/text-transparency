delightful minor film 
juggling comedy and detective 
romance and drama genre as nimbly as lt kenny william
( melvyn dougla )
balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll
( joan blondell )
and his duty to the force
as an ace detective.this hodge-podge may not appeal to all viewer today ,
but in its day 
it had something to offer every member of the movie-going family ,
and the resolution to the rather tired feeling-versus-duty plot is original and refreshing ,
and well worth the wait .
`` the amazing mr. william '' contains what must be among the most outrageous blind date in film history 
and its ight comic repartee sparkle .
ludicrously frocked 
melvyn dougla delivers some of the best line :
`` i would walk down main street in a turkish towel
before i would let any woman control my life ! ''
and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb :
`` good grief !
you look like my aunt nellie ! '
the crime-solving here is standard fare ,
although a fine cast of character actor helps ing the material to life .
from today 's vantage point 
`` the amazing mr. william '' is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct 
all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundary .
while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sex ,
at time it is both subtle and penetrating ,
playing out not only in some of the finer detail of the film ,
but in the battle of genre
that reaches its culmination in the final scene .
