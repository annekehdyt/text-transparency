...
and if you are very ,
very good it will resemble moon over parador.this film
had a slightly silly story ,
but it was a fantasy after all ,
and the casting and the acting was spot-on !
dreyfuss was perfect as the actor/impostor 
full of all the little neurose and vanity you imagine actor to have .
you get a glimpse of what actor are like behind
the scenes.this was one of dreyfuss 's best role ,
just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator !
and the parting scene :
like something out of casablanca 
indeed !
raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police .
he gets some really funny line ,
some of which are homage to other film 
like `` round up the usual suspects ! ''
and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend
-- in addition to being a really hot number :
`` you should get an oscar for tonight ! ''
let us not forget johnny winter as the cia agent and the several guest star playing themselves :
sammy davis jr. 
ike pappas 
dick cavett
-- all perfectly done.all in all 
a memorable romp under the paradorian moon.-r .
