louis sachar 's compelling child 's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger .
it is got murder 
racism 
facial disfigurement and killer lizards.tightly plotted ,
it is a multi-layered 
interlinking story
that spans history to reveal stanley 's own heritage and the secret behind the hole .
it races from latvia 's lush greenness to the pock-marked camp green lake
( hint :
there is no lake and no green )
.disney 's first success is re-creating the novel 's environment
so convincingly -
the set design is superb and without gloss .
the other plus is in the casting .
rising star shia labeouf
( charlie 's angel 2 
project greenlight )
might not be the fat boy of the book ,
but his attitude is right
and he is far from the usual clean-cut hero .
the rest of the cast is filled out equally well 
from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm-turned-bank robber to henry winkler as stanley 's dad .
the downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department -
and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end .
