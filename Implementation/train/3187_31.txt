this is a decent endeavor but the guy
who wrote
the screenplay
seems to be a bit in the dark
as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool .
no 
it is not cgi bug and software company .
actually i am not sure
whether it was a software company -
i saw it
without subtitle so i had to guess what they are talking about .
anyway my point was - instead of wasting your time animating some dumb-ass bug ,
why not throw in more zombie and more action .
2/3 of the 20 minute consist of news bulletin 
bug 
some guy yelling about something .
and to makes matter worse
( more boring )
most of the death occur off-screen .
i realize
that is all too common for no-budget movie ,
but then there were some very impressive effect
( well 
kind-a of )
which left me wondering
why did the director
( or screenwriter 
whatever )
chose to focus on how the epidemic started -
it is a short ,
nobody 's gon na care anyway .
