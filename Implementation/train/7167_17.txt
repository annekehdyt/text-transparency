... the first film i had to walk out on .
and it was the cast and crew pre-screening
( not that i was involved 
i hasten to add ) .
i made it through the first hour ,
so i reckon i am just qualified to comment ,
but that was my limit.like other comment here ,
how did this get through any kind of qa .
an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue 
the epitome of wooden acting 
awful casting ,
all wrapped together
without a plot.tara fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre 
almost comic .
she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history.as i left the screening ,
the director and producer were drinking in a bar outside the cinema .
they obviously could not sit through it again either .
