this afternoon we took the kid to the movie
and saw neil gaiman stardust and all i can say
is wow.it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything
but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen 
maybe even the best movie of any kind
and it is all neil gaiman 's fault.sure ,
i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog
which was smart 
flowed smoothly 
and made the character completely believable.i could go on for day about the spectacular acting 
charlie cox is perfect as tristan 
claire daine is brilliant as yvaine 
and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare.the pure joy ought about by the humor
which managed to be laugh our loud funny ,
intelligent enough
to make the first shrek look like an 80 's sitcom ,
and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.special effect
were near perfect ,
true this was no lotr or star war sf extravaganza
but where they were use
they were exactly what was called for 
not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly.then there is the story ?
what can i say .
how often do you come across a story
containing all of the classic fairytale formula component
that does not just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff .
it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time.any one of those thing would have made this a good movie ,
all of them combined make it a great movie
but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world
that those element combine to ing to life well .
once again neil gaiman has done it ,
he has driven another dagger into my heart
by creating a world of fantasy
that is so beautiful and enchanting
that i would do almost anything to live in it
and only given me a short glimpse into it .
i did not want it to end ,
i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person ,
to travel it is field and valley ,
stroll through it is marketplace
and meet it is resident both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever .
it is a feeling
that i have noticed
whenever i have read anything by gaiman 
the sandman 
american god 
coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness
when i finished reading them
because it was over ,
i could not see anything more into the world
he had created
which seemed to be so much more viant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different.in the end i am sure
that neil 's writing and this movie will not have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say
you will not regret the time or money
spent watching this movie ,
it is easily one of the top 5 movie i
have ever seen and i can guarantee
that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it .
