what a poor excuse for new zealnd movie making .
i am ashamed to call myself a new zealander
when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv
( aug 2006 ) .
the cast is made up of a large number of local soap star .
the ship 
in real life 
is one of the inter-island ferry
that travel daily between the two main island
and even has the company 's logo
( a dolphin ) still all over the set
including on the ship 's funnel .
the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the usa and mexico .
it has obvious sign of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship
on it is maiden voyage .
one of the scene shows the snow capped peak of new zealand 's south island in the background for god 's sake !
must have been a very cold time on the usa/mexico area !
the story is weak ,
the acting is weaker
and the new zealand/american accent just do not work .
i expect
the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie
and that was a waste of money
better
spent on a real production .
i know high school kid in new zealand
who could make better movie with their cell phone .
goof :
there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it
and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck ,
presumably to make it look like it was american .
but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging -
you would think
they would have noticed
that in the prop department before attaching it .
i would love to go on
but it just is not worth the trouble in any way .
