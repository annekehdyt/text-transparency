with such actor as ralph richardson 
raymond massey 
cedrick hardwicke 
and margaretta scott 
how can you go wrong .
very unusual scenic ,
especially the modern one .
the realization of the modern machinery is very effective .
here you have ray-gun blast from building vehicle
that help clear the area ,
so new structure can be made .
although she is much younger in this film ,
it is not very hard to figure out
who the future mrs. pumphrey from the bbc series ,
all creature great and small is going to be !
really effective `` reappearance '' of both raymond massey and ralph richardson .
the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer 
artur honegger
and it is also unusual .
for the time
( 1936 )
it looks like
they used really ,
large set or the effect make
it seem that way .
lastly 
it is a really good story .
