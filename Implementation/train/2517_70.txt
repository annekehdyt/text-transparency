we should all congratulate uwe boll .
he is done the unthinkable .
he may be the only director
to have two movie in the bottom 100 on imdb !
he is like some kind of cinematic cockroach .
no matter how little talent he has ,
and no matter how bad these movie are ,
he manages to keep making them .
i know ,
he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund 
but even so 
his ability
to keep making movie
despite absolute ,
complete failure is one of the great mystery of the universe.it would not be so bad
except that video game developer keep giving their best property to this guy .
i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of game .
even the latest one 
the new nightmare 
was good for a few hour of game play .
there was a good movie
to be made out of edward carnby 's adventure ,
but this is not it .
now uwe boll has gotten his hand on bloodrayne and hunter :
the reckoning .
what is next 
silent hill ?
doom ?
i can only imagine the swath
that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptation
if he is not stopped .
someone needs to take away his line of credit ,
or these video game publisher need to wise up
and realize
that
when they make a bad movie out of a game
that kills the franchise ,
no one is interested in that title any more.think about it 
is house of the dead
or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore ?
no way .
a new house of the dead game comes out for x-box
and nobody 's gon na care .
the title is dead ,
and all
because of uwe boll .
so if any of you out there work for a game publisher ,
or know a game publisher ,
or have access to a game publisher ...
please warn them .
this movie itself is not even worth reviewing .
i can not separate what i did not like about this pile of dung from the rest of it .
literally 
everything about it sucks .
the writing 
the acting 
the music 
the cg effect 
the editing .
i thought
that
if i waited
until it came out on dvd
and then rented it with low expectation ,
i would not be disappointed .
boy 
was i wrong .
never underestimate uwe 's ability
to turn out a big 
steaming pile of boll sh*t .
