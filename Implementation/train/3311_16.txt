watching this movie was a waste of time .
i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie ,
but i resisted .
i do not know what ridley scott intended ,
but i learned that in the army 
woman get as stupid as man .
they learn to spit ,
to insult and to fight in combat ,
and that is also a waste of time
( in my opinion ) .
and 
anyway 
what the hell was that final scene in lybia ?
are they still fighting gadafi or is it
that it is easy for everyone to believe
islamic person are always a danger ?
