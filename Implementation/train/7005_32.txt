hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour-de-star-wars-force
( luke :
how strong ?
vader :
the strength of a small pony ) ,
in which ,
being the master
he is ,
he does not even eak a sweat ,
ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage.. -and
that is with almost 2 hour of whirling his way thru history 
its birthplace 
europe 
and more.from heimlich 's middle-of-the-night 
`` i have invented a maneuver ! ''
to the british empire 's `` ..do you have a flag.. ? ''
and ancient deadbeat god 
`` jeff !
the god of biscuit ! ''
and many more 
this is fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lungs funny.and i confess
to having passed on this video dozens of time over the year ,
seeing as a british transvestite standup 
vogueing on a chair 
is one longshot of a rental after all ,
especially one going back 10 year now .
and yet 
the material is not only timeless but almost oracular ,
turning present day into nothing more than an amplified ,
funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago ,
although come to think about it ,
that may just be a coincidence .
