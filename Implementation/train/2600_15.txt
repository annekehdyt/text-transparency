another demonstration of kurosawa 's genius 
his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic life of tokyo slum dweller ,
essentially a series of interweaving vignette
depicting several group of person eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town .
swinging from comedy to tragedy and back ,
this film shows
how person deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way 
mostly retreating into themselves
and living in the fantasy world of their own head ,
withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol .
mixing kitchen-sink realism with kabuki-esque theatric 
kurosawa toys expertly with the emotion of his audience ,
drawing tear and laughter with equal deftness .
a wonderful 
draining experience .
