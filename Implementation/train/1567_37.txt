stalker is right !
girl see guy 
girl wants guy 
girl contrife mundane way
to keep bumping into him ,
girl will not leave him alone ,
girl pretend
to be a patient ,
girl can not stop talking about him 
girl pretend to love another guy
( or two ) ,
he does not pay attention to her
because she is annoying ,
girl still will not leave him alone .
played right ,
drake 's character could have been charming
but she is completely 
wholly 
unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant 's character 
her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull 
and sadly 
drake 's attempt at playing 
`` charmingly screwball '' comes off as 
`` disturbingly demented . ''
grant is himself 
as usual ,
which is fine for cary
but it is as close to a phoned-in performance
as i have ever seen from him .
the direction is lackluster
and the dialog is just plain dim.screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully
and when it fails ,
like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt 
it just stink .
worse still 
drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order .
she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic .
