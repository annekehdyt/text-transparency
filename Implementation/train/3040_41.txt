this is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller .
in the original 
van damme was among several dead vietnam war vet revived to be the perfect soldier
( unisol ) .
in this one 
it is 
i guess 
about a dozen year later 
since van damme has a daughter about that age .
now he is working with the government in a classified installation
to train the latest unisol - codenamed unisol 2500 
for some reason .
as usual 
something goes wrong :
the on-site super-computer
( named seth
- like the snake in `` king coa '' the same year )
goes power-crazy ,
takes command of the unisol ,
and even downloads its computer ain into a new super-unisol body
( jai white ) .
we are lookin ' at the next step in evolution 
folk !
most of van damme 's fight are with one particularly mean unisol
( pro wrestler goldberg )
who just keeps on comin ' :
drop him off a building - no good ;
run him down with a truck - no go !
shoot him 
burn him - forgetaboutit !
much of the humor is traced
to how van damme is now outmoded and out-classed
( he is even going grey around the edge ) .
but ,
though he takes a lickin ' ,
he keeps on kickin ' !
most sequel of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitation of the original ,
and
while this one is certainly no stroke of genius ,
it manages to be consistently entertaining ,
especially if you are a pro-wrestling fan .
