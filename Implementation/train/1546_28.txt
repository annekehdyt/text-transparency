to be honest ,
i had no idea
what this movie was about
when i started it .
that is how i watch movie whenever possible .
no preconception .
i thought
this was going to be a movie about stoner in the wood or something .
i was wrong ,
kinda.loaded was kind of boring at first
but once it started to get going
it really hooked me .
i know
the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous
where you feel helpless but to do thing
that you do not want to do.another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ .
these kind of thing do happen .
i am sorry
but not everyone lives in a dream world
where nothing bad can happen
and crazy situation are `` implausible '' .
really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen .
the creator of this movie as well as the actor did a great job of portraying
how thing can just go bad
and how person can make really bad choice .
sometimes thing turn out good ,
sometimes they turn out bad
and such is life.i highly recommend this movie .
