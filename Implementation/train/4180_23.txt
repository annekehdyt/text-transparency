working-class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable
as they come ,
yet there are moment of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of star jane fonda and robert de niro
( both terrific ) .
she is a widow
who can not move on ,
he is illiterate and a closet-inventor
-- you can probably guess the rest .
adaptation of pat barker 's novel `` union street ''
( a better title ! )
is so laid-back it verges on bland ,
and the film 's editing is a mess ,
but it is still pleasant ; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy .
there are no overture to serious issue
( even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story )
and no real firework ,
though the character are intentionally a bit colorless
and the lead are toned down to an interesting degree .
the finale is pure fluff
-- and cynic will find it difficult to swallow --
though these two character deserve a happy ending
and the picture would not really be satisfying any other way .
