in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre
it is supposed to be : child 's .
they had more guideline
to follow in order to make this movie
( meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st )
taking all
that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch .
sequel usually make me nervous ,
however this one did pretty well for itself .
knowing
that it did not have the star power of fraiser
as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe
showeman did pretty well as the lead .
the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at time fit well for a younger audience ,
if you want to watch a movie
and hope for academy award honor this is not it ,
but
if you want to watch a simple 
fun ,
energy filled movie
you would make a good choice with this one .
