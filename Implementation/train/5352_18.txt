with all
that going on in the world
sometimes we need an escape .
curly sue is just that .
not a complicated plot or deep meaning ;
however it is not devoid of substance .
there is more than furious action or heart pounding dramas .
there are the charming little show
you can watch with your kid
and have enough substance to enjoy with your date .
try it you may like it more than you think .
the little girl is really smart and cute .
the `` dad '' and the girl go thru some slapstick routine .
when a jealous boyfriend step in 
trouble ews for curly and the life sh known may be torn asunder .
fred thompson and kelly lynch play good role
as the upper crust and alison porter and jame belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless drifter .
their world collide and comedy ensue .
