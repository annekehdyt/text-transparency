i was pleased to see
that she had black hair !
i have been a fan for about 30 year
now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempt to film the stories.i was pleased
that the screenwriter updated the period
to include a computer ,
it did not spoil it at all .
in fact i watched the film twice in one day ,
a sure sign
that it was up to standard .
this is what i do with book
that i like as well.i thought
all the character were well depicted
and represented the early day of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip .
i would also have to disagree with a comment
made by an earlier reviewer about baddy
having to be ugly .
has he actually read the book ?
i thought
this was a very good film
and look forward to sequel with anticipation .
