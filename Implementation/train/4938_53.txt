this movie has several thing going for it .
it is a `` feel good '' story .
the character and actor are likable 
realistic and present fine performance .
most important 
i believe ,
is that dennis quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball .
robert redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in `` the natural ,
and so did kevin costner in `` for love of the game '' and `` bull durham . ''
in `` major league 
'' tom berenger and charlie sheen looked like they knew
what they were doing ,
but many of the other did not ,
and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny .
so many earlier baseball movie ,
even where the story might be interesting ,
presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the lead ,
they were ludicrous in this respect .
in `` the stratton story '' and `` strategic air command 
'' jimmy stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player ,
as your overweight 
non-athletic 
elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion .
other virile and physically robust star
( e.g. 
gary cooper as lou gehrig ;
robald reagan as grover cleveland alexander ;
and dan dailey as dizzy dean )
also exhibited a degree of baseball ability
that would put them in the late round
while `` choosing-up '' for a game at the sunday picnic
( even if coed ,
and even if your uncle were involved ) .
the scene of quaid 's high school team he coached 
the one
where he attends his tryout with the devil rays ,
and those with him playing in two minor league and in the american league ,
all ring true .
the participant are believable and capable .
in addition 
he is an engaging actor
who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization
( except 
to a degree 
some of his `` over-the-top '' scene 
and his forced accent 
in his portrayal of jerry lee lewis ) .
but he is definitely on-target here ,
and this movie is a `` 9 
'' as good 
or better 
as any other of this genre 
except for `` the natural . ''
