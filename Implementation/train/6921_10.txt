i think
that the movie was kind of weird .
in the opening scene 
a person is killed for no reason .
he does not get mentioned again .
the special effect could have also be better
but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie .
it is not the best example of a classic horror movie
but it still was an alright movie .
i give it about a 5/10 of the scale .
