when i bought my toy story tape
when it came out to video
after being released in theater i
saw a trailer for this
that said from the creator of toy story .
as soon as i saw
that i knew this was gon na
be a good feature !
i was right !
a bug 's life like toy story is great story 
great character and great animation .
my favorite character are dim the rhino beetle
voiced by brad garrett
and hemlich the caterpillar
voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft .
my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick
( david hyde pierce )
lifts up hemlich
trying to distract the bird and hemlich 's like you hoo mr. early bird .
how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim 's like i am going to snap !
i am going to snap !
i just died laughing at that scene .
being a big fan of insect i
think
a bug 's life is my favorite pixar
even though i know a lot of person
consider
it the worst pixar film ever !
i do not know
how you could hate a pixar film !
i think
they are all pretty good film !
good job pixar !
