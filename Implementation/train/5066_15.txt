dysfunctional family goes home for the holiday and murder and mayhem result .
violent sexy milligan at his most home made .
little better than a home movie
( as much of milligan film are )
this is a trip into depravity 1960 's style .
notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome ,
playing now more as quaint .
( though decidedly r rated ) .
the film suffer from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production .
( no one was ever sure
where the money went on his movie
since he was always oke ) .
its a bad bad movie
that not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist
or because its got some good looking person fooling around .
