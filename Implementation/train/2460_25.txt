this film has a lot of strong point .
it has one of the best horror cast outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle :
lionel atwill 
fay wray 
and dwight frye 
plus leading man melvyn douglas .
it is got all the right ingredient :
bat 
a castle with lot of stone staircase 
a mad scientist 
townspeople waving torch and hunting vampire 
an `` igor '' -type character 
a beautiful girl 
even a goofy-haired burgomeister .
the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative .
there is even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script.but
it is not really a monster movie
because there is nothing supernatural going on in `` kleinschloss ''
( `` little castle '' ) .
the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist
( nicely played by atwill )
who values his work more highly than human lives.it is not top-tier material ,
because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye .
but it is worth a look
if you like early b/w horror picture .
