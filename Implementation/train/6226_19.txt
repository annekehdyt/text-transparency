it should first be said
that i have read the manga
and therefore my argument is based on the differences.this anime greatly disappointed me
because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova .
what it left behind was merely a husk of what
it could have been .
many of the character lacked the depth
that is seen in the manga .
alucard is not the sympathetic character
that secretly wishes for death .
walter 's story lacks the betrayal .
and the nazi villain
that plot to engulf the world in war
are completely absent .
instead 
the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito
who is defeated against what appear to be all odds.my primary complaint
is not that the anime diverges from the manga ,
but that it does such a poor job .
