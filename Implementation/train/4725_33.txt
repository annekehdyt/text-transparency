i find it hard to believe
that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist .
where the exorcist was subtle and creepy ,
stigmata was blunt 
clumsy ,
and way too formulaic.this is one of the most visually beautiful film i have seen in a while ,
but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition
that makes it unbearable .
my interest in this movie was peaked
when it was compared to the exorcist 
and my visit to the official web site increased
that interest .
the web site had many tale of `` actual '' stigmata throughout history .
however 
scene by scene 
the movie is so obsessed by its quest for `` genuineness ''
that it becomes comical at first ,
then outright hard to watch toward the end .
i began getting suspicious
when the priest charged with investigating potential miracle walk into the beauty parlor
where our would-be heroine cut hair and 
evidently 
flirt with priests.the plot :
a woman
without faith in god
begins receiving the wound of christ
( the stigmata )
and is baffled and upset about the ordeal .
a priest is sent straight from the vatican
to investigate the case .
is frankie possessed by satan 
or a vessel for jesus christ ?
the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends .
