though not a horror film in the traditional sense ,
this creepy little film deliver the good .
it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town draining its victim of their blood .
polouse inspector karl brettschneider 
melvyn douglas in one of his early role 
is skeptical believing
a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok .
the only one
who believes him
is ruth bertin
( faye wray )
the inspector 's girlfriend and lab assistant to dr. otto von niemann
( lionel atwill )
who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory .
the townspeople suspect the weirdo herman gleib ,
played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye
who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role .
the film contains quite a bit of humor
which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murder
being committed .
one funny part has gussie schnappmann
( maude eburne ) ,
ruth bertin 's aunt ,
thinking
weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog .
maude eburne and dwight frye make a good comedy team.this budget movie ings in element from `` the cabinet of dr. caligari '' with dr. niemann
using the power of suggestion
to make a somnambulist carry out his order 
from `` frankenstein ''
by using the human blood
to help create life in the laboratory ,
and `` dracula ''
since the murder are believed by everyone
except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker .
thse element are mixed well by director frank r. strayer with a little comedy
thrown in for good measure .
the concoction works .
the restored version i viewed used tinting
to increase the spooky atmosphere .
so try to see the this version if possible .
