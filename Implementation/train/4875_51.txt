***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** are all teen slasher flick suffering from a drought of originality ?
it awfully seems so .
first of all 
this is a noble premise
that could have been utilized well .
a rejected young nerd
who grows up 
stalk and murder all the girl
who tortured the hell out of him
when he was in junior high ?
can not say
you had nothing to work with .
but this film goes through the same motion
as all the other recent slasher .
everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly
when a false alarm is coming
and exactly
when the killer will strike .
we know the pattern by now .
these stupid slasher movie push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute .
let me ask you something :
who 
in their right mind 
is going to surprise a friend of their in a dark 
dreary morgue in the middle of the night
and just surprise her out of the blue
while she is all alone
and surrounded by corpse ?
does that make any damn sense at all ?
`` valentine '' is only occasionally innovative .
one good shot involves the butchering of denise richard ' character .
she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw .
there is some good song in the soundtrack ,
including one cool track by orgy .
the music video is contained in the special feature section on the dvd.even
the acting is mediocre at best .
the actor all sleep through their role .
of course 
david boreanaz is often stoic 
even in his portrayal as the title character on `` angel . ''
denise richard is a fine actress 
though ,
and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie .
`` valentine '' is just like you would expect :
pretentious 
implausible 
forgettable 
cheesy and without a good scare in sight .
do not even bother.my score :
4
( out of 10 )
