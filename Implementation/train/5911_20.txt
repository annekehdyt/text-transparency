i really did not like this movie
because it did not really ing across the message
and idea l'engle ought out in her novel .
we had read the novel in our english class
and i absolutely loved it ,
i am afraid
i can not say the same for the film .
there were some serious difference between the novel and the adapted version
and it just did not do any credit to the imaginative genius
that is madeleine l'engle !
this is the reason
i gave
it such a poor rating .
do not see this movie
if you are a big fan of l'engle 's texts
because you will be sorely disappointed .
however ,
if you are watching the movie for entertainment purpose
( or educational as was my case )
then it is an alright movie !
