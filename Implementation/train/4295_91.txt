kim basinger star as della 
a housewife
who has twin child
( terri and tammi-played by luke gair and erika-shaye gair )
and an abusive jerk for a husband
( kenneth ) ,
played by craig sheffer.the movie opens on christmas eve .
kenneth is on his way home from work ,
driving a nice car too i might add .
he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner
i would assume .
when he gets home ,
he sees
that the floor is a mess with shoe and toy spread all about .
this angers him even more
and he takes up with his wife 
della ,
asking her why
the house is always a mess .
he pins her up againt the wall .
the twin 's watch from the stair .
he punches the wall ,
leaving a hole in it
and walks away .
she tends to the child ,
trying to comfort them .
after that is all said in done ,
she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping
and because she is out of wrapping paper .
she gets there
and the parking lot is full
because there is a lot of last minute shopper there .
while she is looking for a parking space ,
she notices a car
taking up two space and this irks her .
she finally finds a spot to park ,
makes her way over to the hoggish car
and leaves a note under the wiper
calling the owner a `` selfish jerk '' .
then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping.when
she finally does leave the mall ,
it is closing and many person have left already .
not the owner of the car she left the note on however
and she notices this on the way to her vehicle .
she also notices
that the note
she left under the wiper
is no longer there .
odd .
when she gets to her vehicle ,
she gets in to start it up .
she notices a car coming up behind her
and it blocks her from backing up .
she gets out of the car
only to be confronted by the owner of the car
( chuckie-played by lukas haas )
she left the note on and a posse of his thug friend .
yelling ensue and a mall cop
( no 
not paul blart )
makes his way over to them to see what the problem is ,
only to have his ain blown out of his head by chuckie .
while this happens ,
della jump in her vehicle ,
starts it and drives over the median in front of her .
chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase .
della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development
but she is unharmed .
she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle 
open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox
before the thug get there .
with that 
della spends the rest of the night
trying to outrun
and out wit the thug armed with only the tool
that she has in her toolbox as weapon .
the first kill 
in my opinion 
is the best .
the first kill
that della performs anyway .
the last one was probably the weakest
and it should of been the best considering
that this was the main bad guy
she was offing .
i will admit
that there will be some
that are put off buy the ending
and i was let down a bit myself .
as a whole though it was a fun flick
and move along nicely at it is 1 hour and 20 minute run time .
