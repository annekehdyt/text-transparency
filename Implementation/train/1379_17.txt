baseketball is one of the funniest movie i
have ever seen .
it is an off-the-wall movie starring south park creator matt stone and trey parker.they play two slacker friend
who create a sport in their driveway
which goes on to become a national sensation .
most of the gag are indeed hilarious
but the funniest part of the movie is when player attempt to `` psyche-out '' other member of the opposing team .
there is no rule
about what is not allowed ,
so naturally they do the craziest thing possible .
one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast ,
and after watching for about half an hour i found myself
asking `` wow this this over already ? ''
another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak ,
who is a hyped-up little guy .
baseketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable line ,
and it is very fun to watch !
