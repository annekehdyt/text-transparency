i am going to spend as much time on this review
as the writer did on the script .
this is easily the worst sequel ever made.they killed navin johnson .
not only was mark blankfield 's performance god-awful ,
so was everyone elses ! !
the physical comedy was forced 
flat and predictable .
the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkey
using the pen name ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci .
how the producer managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement
is beyond me .
they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent-less buffoon .
director michael schultz should be ashamed of himself.i want the 96 minute of my life i
spent watching this befouled memory of a illiant comedy back
so i can try and convict everyone
involved for this cinematic atrocity .
