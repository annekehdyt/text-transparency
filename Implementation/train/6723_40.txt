this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community ,
something
that would stand up and scream at the world medium
to take notice
as we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our option
in producing fine work with open source tool .
after the basic version download
( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem )
eventually got here i hit my first snag .
medium player 
mplayer classic and winamp failed to open it on my xp box ,
and then totem 
xine and kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server .
mplayer managed to run it flawlessly .
going to be hard to spread the word about it
if normal user can not even open it ... the film .
beautiful soundtrack 
superb lighting 
masterful camera work and flawless texturing .
everything looked real .
and then the two main character moved ... .
and spoke ...
and the movie died for me .
everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main character
( except for proog in the dancing scene )
looked fluid
and totally alive .
the two main character were animated so poorly
that at time i was wondering
if there are any game on the market at the moment with cut-scene
that entail less realism than this.any frame in the movie is fantastic.. as a frame ,
and the thing is great if
neither actor are moving .
i am
so glad i have not actually recommended this to anyone .
i would ruin my reputation.oh ,
and final fantasy had a more followable
and cunningly devised plot.this movie would get 10 star
if it was not for the tragedy
that sits right there on the screen .
