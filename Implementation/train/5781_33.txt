this movie has a very simple yet clever premise - an unemployed man
trying to steal from a convenience store ,
and the store clerk catches him in the act ...
the thief runs away with the store-clerk right after him .
all the while 
the store clerk is in trouble with a low-rank yakuza chinpira
( gangster ) .
along the chase for the thief ,
they catch the eye of the yakuza
who 's been looking for the convenience store clerk .
the story then moves into high gear in the form of a tom and jerry
( cat and mouse ) ,
but is added with the dog chasing after the cat .
the entire 2nd act of d.a.n.g.a.n .
runner
( can be translate to english as `` pinball runner '' )
is about the chase ,
and the chase goes on and on to the point
that by the end of the 2nd act ,
the bum forgets why he is running away ,
and the yakuza do not remember
which of the 2 guy he is chasing ,
nor does he remember
why they are running away from him.similar to sabu 's later film postman blue ,
the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action 
with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injected
to keep the audience engaged .
what falls short is the ending ,
to which the chase stops
when the three man run out of steam ,
and into one of the most chaotic mexican stand-off you will see on film
that looks almost as if sabu was paying homage to tony scott 's true romance
( written by quentin tarantino ) .
