i had no idea
what this movie was until i read about it in the l.a. weekly .
i generally agree with the review in the la weekly
and decided to get a ticket for this film .
the film star molly parker
( from my favorite television show deadwood )
and lukas haas
-- who i suspect
we will be seeing more of in the very near future .
the film is funny 
heartwarming 
features great acting 
and beautiful photography .
i do not know
if the film has distribution ,
but i hope
it does -
or will - soon .
this is destined to be a real indie gem .
it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews !
the only disappointment was that molly parker was not there at the screening .
even without her there ... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival .
