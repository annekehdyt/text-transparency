i am shocked .
shocked and dismayed
that the 428 of you imdb user
who voted
before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 .
7 ? ! ? ?
-
that is a c ! .
if i could give fobh a 20 ,
i would gladly do it .
this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy 
alongside half baked and mallrat 
as one of the most hilarious film of all time .
if you know _anything_ about rap music -
you must see this ! !
if you know nothing about rap music - learn something ! ,
and then see this !
comparison to 'spinal tap ' fail
to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film .
if you liked bob robert ,
you will love this .
watch it and vote it a 10 !
