how could 4 out of 16
prior voter give this movie a 10 ?
how could more than half the prior voter give it a 7 or higher ?
who is voting here ?
i can only assume
it is primarily kid
-- very young kid .
the fact is
that this is a bad movie in every way .
the story is stupid ;
the acting is hard to even think of as acting ;
the character are characterless ;
and the dialogue is terrible .
i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci-fi channel .
in the sad event
that it is ever reoadcast ,
i suggest you read a book instead .
