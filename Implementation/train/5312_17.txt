whilst it is universally acknowledged
that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode
they have been ,
they are ,
they will be ,
whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point .
as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief ,
although the less charitable may not do .
jame whitmore was ave to take on the task
of directing such a difficult episode ,
invisible elephant and gorilla suit sounds like a recipe for disaster ,
but he pulls it off with style ,
the teaser being an absolute gem .
lance guest does a great job
of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethe with menace as ed meecham .
forget fearful symmetry 's dubious originality
and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file .
