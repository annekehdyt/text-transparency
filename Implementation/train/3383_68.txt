i have not seen all of jess franco 's movie ,
i have seen 5 
i think ,
and there are more than 180 of them .
so maybe it is a bit early
to say so but `` necronomicon getr\u00e4umte s\u00fcnden ''
( better known as 'succubus ' ,
but that is the cut version )
is according to me if not the best 
certainly on of franco 's best .
franco is best
known ( although 'known ' might be slightly exaggerated )
for `` vampiros lesbos '' 
a weird cultish movie
that got more acclaim in the mid 90 's
when person
found out jess franco
was also an interesting composer .
through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man
and found out
what was to be expected
after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the cucumber '
( 'vampyros lesbos ost ' ) :
jess franco is an overwhelming director .
when the phone rang during 'vampiro ' 
i let it ring .
i just wanted to see more of the movie .
since that moment franco never could grip me that much .
but then i stumbled on this movie .
it is even better than `` vampiros lesbos '' ,
i think .
franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera .
we find out he can do a lot .
i certainly did not expect to find `` necronomicon ''
that great : its beginning did not impress me at all .
remember 
i had seen `` vampiros lesbos ''
before
( although chronologically that came only three year later )
and both movie kinda start the same .
but then the story went on 
puzzling and gripping 
beautiful camera work
and the stuff you would like to see godard do
if he were not so occupied with spreading his political message .
later on in the movie i heard a dialogue
about which art was or was not old-fashioned .
the man says
that all movie have to be old-fashioned
because it takes week
before the audience sees what got filmed .
but the girl replies that `` bunuel 
fritz lang and godard yesterday made movie for tomorrow '' .
janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon 
a franco regular ,
is also there .
luckily the acting is good
( something
that can spoil a lot of franco movie for you ,
but not this one ) .
but certainly watch out for the dummy scene .
the erotic tension 
the wild directing and the fact
that it is a yesterday 's movie for tomorrow
make it a movie a lot of person should see .
the fact
that it is a bit more accessible than `` vampiros lesbos ''
certainly helps .
