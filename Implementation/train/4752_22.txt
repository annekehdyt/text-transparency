i have seen this movie many time ,
( and recently read the book
the movie is based on )
and every time i see it ,
i just want to slap all four of them .
the fact
that they do not clue in to the fact
that tom hank 's character is flipping into his dandd
( oops mandm ) :
)
persona
( `` oh ,
he is just acting in character . '' )
outside of the gaming session .
that and the fact that after three month of therapy 
let 's just destroy all that and feed his delusion !
these kind of person are what give rpgs a bad name.also the corny 'love ballad ' 
and the music
done by 'cat on a piano ' and 'stop us
if we get too annoying '
are almost enough
to set your tooth on edge !
