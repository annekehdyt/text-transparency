the order fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is
that the character 's simply do not resonate or even react.two example :
a priest 
walking through a graveyard late at night 
is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirit .
after fighting them off ,
he calmly resumes his walk
when his buddy come up .
`` anything wrong ? ''
his buddy asks 
having seen the attack .
`` just some demonic spirit-nothing i could not handle . ''
no reaction 
no surprise 
just like he had changed a tire .
his buddy is equally unconcerned ...
must be standard priest training ... [
`` and then you put the wafer into their mouth .
any question ?
ok ,
moving on 
demon spirit attack ... ''
] example two :
at one point the priest need an answer to a question ,
and only a demon
( or something ,
who cared by now )
could provide it .
how ?
why 
you have to ask a dying man !
so the demon has some random person
hung in front of the two priest
so they can ask their question to the thrashing 
gasping man .
`` hey 
do not kill him ! ''
or maybe `` that is not nice ! ''
would have been more realistic then their response .
they never ask
that they let the man go or stop-in fact ,
the closest to reacting
they get is mild annoyance .
they ask their question
and go.i had to shut it off at
that point-my ain was starting to atrophy.avoid* / ****
