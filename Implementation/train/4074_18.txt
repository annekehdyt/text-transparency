this movie is good for tv .
i like it
because i am a huge fan of disaster film
even though this is a family film .
accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half
they got the character names right
but in the book there was no storm chaser 
the the car scene
involving the hatch family
running away from the tornado
was not in the book
instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety .
and in the book dan and his friend are both 12-years old .
thats all i can think of .
overall this was a good movie
even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book .
did you know
the book was based on a true story of a series of tornado devastating a small neaska town in 1980 ?
