have just finished watching `` shall we dansu ? ''
and i really loved it .
what a lovely and delightful movie !
the story is amazingly good 
with drama 
comedy and romance .
the cast is excellent ,
and i was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director masayuki suo and professional ballet dancer tamiyo kusakari .
on last september 06th 
i saw the american remake of `` shall we dansu ? ''
for the first time 
and i found it a delightful entertainment .
but now i can say
that it is another unnecessary remake ,
and i recommend this original film instead .
my vote is ten.title
( brazil ) :
`` dan\u00e7a comigo ? ''
( `` dance with me ? '' )
