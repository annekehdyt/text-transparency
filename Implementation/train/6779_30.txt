i rented this back in the 80 's
and honestly can not remember anything specific about the movie -
only
that it is the worst movie i
have ever seen .
this is not one of those
`` it was so bad ,
it was funny '' .
this is not one of those
`` it was so gory ,
it leaves you with a bad feeling '' movie .
it was not even one of those
`` what the heck was that ? ''
movie .
i can not recall the performance of the actor ,
but it was poorly shot ,
the story was disjointed ,
and it had no definable style .
when it was over ,
i was angry
that i had wasted the time.i
have seen plenty of movie i
did not understand
because of unfamiliar culture 
style and/or story-telling ,
but it was clear that those movie had some of those property .
the incubus has none.i actually contemplated not making a comment on this `` piece '' for fear
that someone may watch it out of curiosity ,
but i am compelled to warn anyone
who appreciates film to skip this movie .
