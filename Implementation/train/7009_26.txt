the show is average .
it does not make me laugh particularly .
however 
i think
courtney really ings it down .
she does not look natural .
she has these three way to talk 
all robotic .
she talks quietly
( with no intonation ) ,
she talks normally ( with no intonation ) ,
or she does that thing where she starts talking normally ,
and starts yelling gradually .
however 
her yelling is like `` let 's pretend i am yelling
because i should not be too loud on the set '' .
she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress
doing this funny thing .
it is annoying .
you can not really get her personality ,
because she does not really produce emotion ,
and does not get upset .
she has this husband ,
who 's doing all these stupid thing ,
and there is no reaction from her .
very dry and plain acting .
