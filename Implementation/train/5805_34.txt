i have loved all of cream 's work ,
even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work
to take hold .
even when they go for as long as twenty minute with some of their song
( spoonful and toad off of wheel of fire are prime example )
still rock the sock off of more than half of any
given rock act working today .
this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate
rock band reunion ever with their royal albert hall show last year .
they may have gotten older ,
as have their fan ,
but the energy is still there ,
with the great arrangement of classic blue song as well as their own .
the rendition of white room 
badge 
politician 
spoonful 
sunshine of your love 
not one seems to miss a beat .
clapton 's solos have a formation
that he sometimes does not have when on stage with his solo band .
ginger baker ,
enough said .
jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocal still with a kind of power
that clapton could never get on his own .
bottom line ,
if you want to see what were the best show
you wish
you
had seen last year
( well ,
some may have seen them ) ,
it is all on this dvd 
with cool special feature .
