the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman
( writer of mirrormask )
and it is really a good story .
i think
it would appeal to any labyrinth 
princess bride or 10th kingdom fan
and yet it is totally unique
and stands up on it is own .
and i feel
the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending
than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman .
i will not spoil it for you.the main character 
tristan
( tristran in the novel ) ,
is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave
kept by a witch in the realm of faerie .
the story begins in a town near a wall
that separates the magical world from the human world .
when there is a falling star tristan promises
to retrieve it for a girl
he is infatuated with .
he is unaware
that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world
and that there are other after her too .
three elderly witch
who want to use her heart to become young again ,
and some bickering princes.it is a really good story .
it has humor and magic and beautiful 
surreal scene and visual .
it is charming and i feel
it can be watched by child and adult of all age .
it is simply magical .
it is a true classic fairy tale ,
the like of which i have not seen in cinema since the 1980s .
