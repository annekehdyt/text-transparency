as a history nut
who is particularly interested in this particular historical event ,
i was very disappointed with the movie .
granted 
the costume and staging was quite authentic ,
but the hollywood portrayal of this `` british little big horn '' was truly boring.the amount of film footage
dedicated to marching or parading troop
has to have been unprecedented in film history .
eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin ,
i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler .
obviously 
the producer had invested heavily into `` staging ''
and were determined to get their money 's worth.despite the outstanding cast ,
their dialogue was 
again 
boring and their character were never developed .
whenever peter o'toole or burt lancaster finished a scene ,
i would cringe with disappointment .
their given line were so weak and meaningless
that i could hardly believe
these were the same two great actor
who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectively.there are worse epic ,
but this one is not much better .
