welcome to collinwood is a lot of thing ,
but it is none of the following :
a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un-originaland yes i know ,
the basis for the movie is another movie .
but as far as hollywood goes ,
this may rank with their most authentic output this decade - and for me ,
it does.the movie is from start to finish 
an absolute gas .
here is why.there is not a bad performance in the film .
the funny part are funny .
the edgy part are edgy .
the script contain 
not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful .
and it does not conform to the hollywood norm
( you will see what i mean ,
when you see the film )
when i was a kid ,
i remember seeing advertisement for the film .
this film went under the radar
after not grossing much at the box office ,
and is not even a cult classic .
the reason why transformer 2 
is seen as acceptable by average movie goer ,
is because they are used
to seeing transformer 2.
if film 's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million piece of s**t ,
the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place -
when 'they ' say
they do not make em like they used to 
'they ' did not see welcome to collinwood.a fun 
mini-masterpiece of caper comedy ,
that refuses to compromise .
one of my favourite .
