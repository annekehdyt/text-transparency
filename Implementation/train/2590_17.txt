when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film ,
i know it is bad .
i wanted to claw my eye out .
i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myer for sacrificing the last shred of dignity
he had .
this is one of the few film in my life i
have watched
and immediately wished to `` unwatch '' ,
if only it were possible .
the other film
being 'troll 2 ' and 'fast and furious ' ,
both which are better than this crap in the hat.i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt
to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.to mike myer ,
i say stick with austin or even resurrect wayne world .
just
because it worked for jim carrey ,
does not mean seuss is a success for all canadian .
