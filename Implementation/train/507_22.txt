a classy offering from amicus 
producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell
( 'the far pavillion ' etc )
turn in a classy 
intelligent 'four-hander ' with a strong cast
( peter cushing 
christopher lee 
jon pertwee 
ingrid pitt etc )
all giving stylish performance ,
despite a low budget
which result in a few 'un-special effect ' .
the most outstanding contribution 
however 
is that of the 7-year-old chloe frank
who turns in chillingly effective account of her part
which makes one 's blood run cold .
only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributor 
this underrated release 
a cut above the run-of-the-mill 'blood 'n ' gut ' shocker movie 
is for those
who appreciate a little thought with their horror .
