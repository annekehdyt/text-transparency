i second the motion
to make this into a movie ,
it would be great ! !
i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game .
i have played it again and again
( over 20 time ) just to try something different
and it gets more interesting every time .
final fantasy eat your heart out ! !
this should be made into a movie ! ! ! ! !
if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition
to have this
made into a movie 
please contact me .
i would love to help with that project any day .
the graphic are great for ps1
and even make you forget
it is ps1 most of the time .
the multitude of side quest makes it different every time you play .
