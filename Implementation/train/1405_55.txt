if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport
-- no 
the pure lifestyle --
of surfing to its perfect form ,
this documentary has done it .
this documentary shows the life is not just about the wave ,
but it is more about the person 
the pioneer 
and the modern day vanguard
that are pushing the envelope of big wave further
than it is ever been.stacy peralta
-- a virtual legend from my early '80s skateboarding day as a socal teen --
has edited ream of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence
and created what is not just a documentary 
but a masterpiece of the genre .
when his heart and soul is in the subject matter
-- and clearly it is here --
his genius is fraught with a pure vision
that does not glamorize 
hype 
or sentimentalize his subject .
he reveres surfer and the surfing/beach lifestyle ,
but does not whitewash it either .
there is a gritty reality to the sport
as well.there is so much
that could be said about this documentary 
about the surfer 
the early history of the sport 
and the wild big wave surfer it profiles .
greg noll 
the first big wave personality
who arguably
pioneered the sport ; jeff carter 
an amazing guy
who rode virtually alone for 15 year on northern california 's extremely dangerous maverick 's big surf ;
and 
the centerpiece of the documentary 
laird hamliton 
big wave surfing 's present day messiah.there is tremendous heart
and warmth among all these guy
-- and a few girl
who show up on camera --
and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean
that comes through in every word .
i found the story of how hamilton 's adopted father met him
and how hamilton as a small 4- or 5-year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming
( and 
again 
stripped of syrupy sentimentality )
.if you like surfing
-- or even if you do not --
this is a wonderful documentary
that must be watched ,
if only because you are a student of the form or someone
who simply appreciates incredibly well-done work of art .
