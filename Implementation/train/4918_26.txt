pinjar is truly a masterpiece ... .
it is a thought provoking film
that makes you think
and makes you question our culture .
it is without a doubt
the best hindi movie i have seen to date .
this film should have been shown at movie festival around the world
and i believe
would have been a serious contender at canne .
all the character were perfectly cast
and urmila matkondar and manoj bhajpai were haunting in their roles.the story
the movie tells
about partition is a very very important story and one
that should never be forgotten.it
has no bias or prejudice
and has given the partition a human story .
here 
no one country is depicted as good or bad .
there are evil indian 
evil pakistanis and good indian and pakistanis .
the cinematography is excellent
and the music is melodious 
meaningful and haunting .
everything about the movie was amazing ...
and the acting just took my eath away .
all were perfectly cast .
