if you are after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi ,
you will be disappointed- however
if you are after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme ,
you have found
you are movie.this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi 's life
that it almost made me weep .
( type in artemisia inaccuracy in google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction article . )
from a purely technical point of view though 
the film was alright :
the set 
costume 
and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience ;
although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracy let it down a bit.i wonder
how the director/co-writer agn\u00e8s merlet defended her film at the time ?
perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim ,
which would 've been unfortunate ,
because let face it ,
she was .
