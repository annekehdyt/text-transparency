i could not take my eye off this movie
when it showed up on cable .
the dialogue and costume are of a quality most readily
associated with soft-core porn .
in this case
the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashing with nunchuks .
( perhaps for sex as well ,
but not on indian tv 
anyway .
)
not being a fan of the genre i could not place jeff wincott ,
and had no lead to search from .
only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif
( so mayoral ! )
for the high-top fade
we remember from beverly hill cop ii
did i make the positive id on her.this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90 's couture or nod-and-wink schlock \u00e0 la paul verhoeven .
can we add a genre tag for `` so-bad-it is-good '' ?
