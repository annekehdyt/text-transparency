fire and ice is an animated film
set in a fantasy world .
the film is about a village
that is destroyed by a giant glacier
which is the home of the evil ice lord
named nekron .
the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn
who sets out to avenge those
who were killed by the glacier .
the ice glacier move through the land of fire
and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creature .
larn sets out to find her
and also sets out to find and kill nekron .
fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi
who is one of my favourite adult animator .
he has ought us such animated masterpiece as the film version of fritz the cat and some film
he has written himself 
like the great film heavy traffic .
i did not like fire and ice nearly as much
as i have ralph bakshi 's other work ,
but i still found the film to be enjoyable .
it had some very nice animation in part
and the story was entertaining enough .
the only basic complaint i have is that i wish
that there was more of a story to the film
because the story
it uses
is very thin
and there
is not a lot to it .
i also wish
the film was a bit longer
because it is under 80 minute in running time .
still it is an entertaining action adventure film
that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kid 8 and older .
i only wish
that there was a more developed story
and it went on a bit longer
than it did .
