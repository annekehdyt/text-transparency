hole ,
originally a novel by louis sachar ,
was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film .
starring sigourney weaver as the warden 
shia labeouf as stanley 
and khleo thomas as zero ,
the role were very well casted ,
and the actor portrayed their role well.the film had inter-weaving storyline
that all led up to the end .
the main storyline is about stanley yelnat and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake .
the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow .
this plot deals with racism
and it is the more deep storyline to the movie .
the third is about elya yelnat and madame zeroni ,
which explains the 100-year curse on the yelnat family .
in my opinion 
these storyline were weaved together very well.contrary to many person 's beliefs ,
i think
that you do not have to have read the book
to understand the movie .
the film is reasonably easy to understand.the acting in the film
was well done 
especially shia labeouf
( stanley ) ,
khleo thomas
( zero ) ,
sigourney weaver
( the warden ) ,
and jon voight
( mr. sir ) .
the other member of d-tent 
jake smith
( squid ) ,
max kasch
( zig-zag ) ,
miguel castro
( magnet ) ,
byron cotton
( armpit ) ,
and brenden jefferson
( x-ray ) ,
enhanced the comic relief of the movie .
however 
the best part were with zero and stanley ,
who made a great team together.although hole is a disney movie ,
it deals with some serious issue such as racism ,
shooting 
and violence .
the film 's dramatization at some point is very well done.i would suggest this movie to person of all age ,
whether they have read the book or not .
you should not miss it .
