the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea
the wender has lost his vision 
his ability
to tell compelling story through a map of the moving picture .
the land of plenty seal the coffin ,
i am afraid ,
by being a vastly unimaginative ,
obviously sentimental and clich\u00e9 'd film .
the character are entirely flat and stereotyped 
the writing 
plot and direction are amateurish 
at best .
for the first time in quite a while 
i was impatient for the film to end
so i could get on with my life .
the war-torn delirium of the uncle 
the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion ...
it all just struck me
as being so simple and pathetic ,
hardly the work of a filmmaker
who once made some compelling magic on screen .
what happened ?
the day of experimentation 
perceptive writing and interesting filming possibility are long behind him ,
i am afraid .
let 's hope
he finds his inspiration again ... at the toronto film festival ,
which is where i saw the film ,
wender was there to introduce it .
completely lacking in humility ,
he offered us the following :
`` i hope ... no 
wait ... i know
you are going to enjoy the next two hour . ''
i am afraid
he could not be more wrong ...
