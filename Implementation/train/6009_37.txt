`` this man 's navy '' is ,
as other comment have indicated ,
a rare and well-filmed look at navy lighter than air
( lta )
activity .
the lta crew were justly proud
that the convoys
they shadowed
never lost a ship to submarine attack .
and the filming at the various nas location give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation
that is long gone .
however 
the first half of the movie is all about beery 
his relationship with his service pal ,
and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother ,
and getting drake 's leg fixed .
only then does the second film start .
the second film is mostly ltas in action ,
taking on a surfaced sub ,
guy get killed
and much damage is caused .
the look is fairly gritty and realistic 
i imagine .
then we shift to southeast asia .
did the navy have ltas there ?
never mind ,
this part is really wild ,
with a blimp being used
to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle .
and the jap are shooting like mad .
shade of vietnam ,
except the getaway is oh ,
so leisurely .
this is a blimp
we are talking about .
in the end 
a feel-good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war .
