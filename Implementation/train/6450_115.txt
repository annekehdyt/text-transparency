18 director had the same task :
tell story of love set in paris .
naturally 
some of them turned out better than other ,
but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - beside ,
would not it be boring
if all of them had the same vision of love ?
here is how i rank the segmant
( that might change on a second viewing ) :1 .
`` quartier latin ''

featuring the always stunning gena rowland and ben gazzara .

`` porte de choisy ''

with barbet schroeder
( mostly known as the director of `` barfly '' 
`` reversal of fortune '' and `` single white female '' )
.i could classify some segmant as illiant and other as average
( or even slightly boring ) ,
but not a single of them is plain bad .
on the whole 
i give `` paris 
je t'aime '' an 8.5/10 and recommand it for what it is :
a lovely mosaic about love and other thing in between .
