tillman jr. 's drama about the first african american navy master diver
( gooding jr. ) ,
who defies all odd and achieves his goal
despite a strict embittered trainer .
the screenplay is not bad 
a bit extreme at time ,
but the direction and acting is first-rate ,
and this film is inspiring
and achieves what its supposed to do .
i liked deniro in the lead ,
although its not on par with his masterful work
( taxi driver 
godfather and all the other )
it is as good as his other good performance such as in king of comedy or angel heart .
deniro is always convincing and believable here 
very good performance 
gooding jr. is not bad 
definitely one of his better performance .
