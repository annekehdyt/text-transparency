the movie is a total crap .
we have two good actor
who are miscast and a meat-head of an actor salman khan
just to attract the female audience .
the story is a crap .
the character poorly sketched .
non existent story telling .
no editing to speak of .
ajay devgan as a rock star..that is a dream in itself .
the movie drags along to the point of decadence .
the whole charade about arjun inging his manna to london 
let him grope his girlfriend
and let him not play at wembley
( vimbley in the dubbing process )
is absurd .
salman khan 's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch .
i remember
seeing some good movie from this producer vipul shah
but this is not one of them .
it seems all the good director are falling prey to the box office mania..that
the mumbai medium moron have created .
this is yet another crap movie in the line of `` wanted '' with idiot actor like salman khan
who has no place in a good hindi cinema .
he is good to the indian cinema
as titanic was to the winter cruise business .
on a positive note-i like asin character dancing bharatnatyam
when she changes to the western style dancing
when the teacher is not looking .
