i was lucky enough
to get to see this film many year ago in england .
i have seen hundred of film since ,
but i have never forgotten this one.although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character ,
he was excellent in the role.a lot of person seem to think
that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in `` from here to eternity ''
but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho.the other role
that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad.i would never see or heard of him before this film .
conrad plays a terrific part in this film.i remember his deep and gravelly voice
and he uses
it beautifully
to enhance the few word
he speaks with a menace
that sets the tone of his character.also i remember the music ,
that both introduce conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears.an excellent film
and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance
to see it again .
it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth .
i see in the title
that it says
that the film is in black and white
but when i saw
it was indeed in full color 
i remember sinatra 's blue shirt .
