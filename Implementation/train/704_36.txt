how do comment like the one
that was the headline by high school girl
even make it on this site ,
this was the stupidest movie i
have ever seen ,
it was ridiculous ,
how can any moron sit there
and say
that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie ,
that might be the most idiotic thing i have ever heard ,
i could sneak up behind you and go `` boo ''
and it would make you jump ,
but that does not mean i am qualified to write or direct a movie ,
not to mention `` they tied everything together at the end '' is not a good reason for a movie
to be well received .
what kind of movie would it be
if they did not tie everything together ,
i guess
that would make it half a movie 
not a whole movie .
so basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie 
well i love
how the youth of today hold the medium and production company to such a high standard .
no wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever
they want ,
we have idiot like that coming up in our country ,
what would happen
if this girl actually ends up leading something someday ,
that is a scary thought .
get a life and go watch a real movie sometime ,
try shawshank redemption or on the waterfront 
or something like that ,
and do not comment
that it was `` boring ''
after you see it ,
just use what little ain god gave you to analyze it a little .
