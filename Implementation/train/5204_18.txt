i did not expect much from this film ,
but boy-o-boy 
i did not expect the movie to be this bad .
chris rock is not showing a good act here ,
you can not get the feeling
that his caracter is real ,
i think
the movie would have been a bit better
if it is drama or romantic scene
would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved .
the movie is like
the film maker were having a bad hangover
making it .
in the `` making of '' they do not show a single smile .
this is a very bad film !
i gave it three out of ten
because of few smile it gave me ,
but i did never laugh !
