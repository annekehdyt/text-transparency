what boob at mgm thought
it would be a good idea
to place the studly clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker ? ?
ironically enough 
another handsome future star 
cary grant 
also played a salvation army guy
just two year later in the highly overrated
she done him wrong .
i guess in hindsight
it is pretty easy to see the folly of these role ,
but i still wonder
who thought
that salvation army guy are `` hot ''
and who could look at these dashing man
and see them as realistic representation of the part they played .
a long time ago 
i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army
( the volunteer of america )
and i never saw any studly guy working there
( and that includes me 
unfortunately ) .
maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead !
so 
for the extremely curious 
this is a good film
to look out for ,
but for everyone else 
it is poor writing ,
sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film .
