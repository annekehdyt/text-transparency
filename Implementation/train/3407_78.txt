young beautiful eva
( hedy lamarr )
marries an older man
( zvonimir rogoz ) .
unfortunately he can not satisfy her sexually and ignores her .
frustrated
she goes home
and plan to get a divorce .
then 
one day 
she is skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the wood .
her horse gallop off with her clothe ...
and she runs
after it !
she meets young and very handsome adam
( aribert mog ) .
they make love
and she realizes this is the man
she wants.ending spoiler ! ! ! !
naturally ,
since this was made in 1933 ,
she has to be punished for her sin
so it leads to a tragic finale .
end of ending spoiler ! ! !
! this horrified person in 1933
but it is pretty tame by today 's standard .
lamarr 's nude swim show nothing
and
when she runs after the horse totally nude ,
it is either shown in extreme long shot
or is covered by anch and such .
there is only a few minor shot of her east .
also
when she has sex with mog ,
nothing is shown but her face
but you see her achieving an orgasm .
these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day
and were cut out completely of the american release .
now today they are back in .
this film would get by with a pg-13 easily now.shock episodes aside this
is just ok.
it is beautifully filmed
and there is next to no dialogue .
except for the music score this could be a silent picture .
luckily all the actor are good
-- lamarr and mog especially and they are so attractive
that they just take your eath away watching them .
also the sequence
where
they make love
is easily one of the most beautifully shot
and acted sequence i have ever seen in a movie .
the scene with the sexual symbolism
( there is quite a few of them )
are unfortunately pretty obvious today .
i actually started to giggle during one ! so 
great direction 
beautiful imagery 
attractive actor 
good acting all around
-- but i was not exactly bowled over by it .
i found the movie slow-moving
( beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me ) ,
somewhat dull 
obvious 
static
and had a negative ending .
i can live with the ending
but it does not excuse the other problem
i had with it .
also the final sequence is really strange
-- and out of place .
so i admire this film more than anything else .
it was well-done
and i would recommend it but with caution .
many person seem to love this movie
so i am in the minority .
use your own judgment .
