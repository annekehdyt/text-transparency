this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money 
anywhere .
it is raw 
gritty ,
the character are real ,
the situation are believable
and it does not shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cop and the criminal 
victim 
lawyer and other person in their various orbits.this show ran for 2 season
and was discontinued
because the show did not sell well overseas .
we are all sorry for its loss :
however 
like fawlty tower 
we will be able to revere this as a limited-length series of uniformly high quality .
