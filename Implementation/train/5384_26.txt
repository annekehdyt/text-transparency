i was 10 year old
when this show was on tv .
by far it was my favorite .
the actor were very credible .
alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous ... .
i just order the dvd
( 15 episode ) .
they did not have super-power .
they just had superior human skill
( strength 
hearing 
sight ) .
the 3 actor were very good in their roll 
very believable .
there was a good story in each episode .
at the time 
there were no special effect or explosion everywhere ,
so the script was suppose to be good ,
and the character perform were great .
there was no fancy stuff 
like in other show .
they did not try to make a joke every 2 minute
to make a light show .
i highly recommend this tv show
to anybody
that like good stuff .
