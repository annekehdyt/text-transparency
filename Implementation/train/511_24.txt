jack lemmon and walter matthau began
and ending their career together .
remember best as the grumpiest of old man as well
as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh ,
lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood 's best loved comedy team of the last 100 year .
not as `` raunchy '' as pryor and wilder 
instead 
they were the classic comedy team
that reflected a more modern marx brother routine .
such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos
that marx 
chaplin and keaton were so famous for .
in the odd couple 
lemmon and matthau play complete opposites
that create the chaos .
the physical comedy is as unique as chaplin .
the joke is usually on themselves as oppose
to passing the joke onto another .
not your typical guy film ,
it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old man
as oppose to two young teenager in their prime .
the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainmant enough .
although this movie is not for everyone ,
this is a great comedy .
