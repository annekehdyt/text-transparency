this is a film
that had a lot
to live down to .
on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i would heard nothing
but bad thing
about it especially a plot
that was criticised for being too complicated to be honest the plot
is something of a red herring and the film suffer
even more when the word `` plot `` is used
because as far as i can see
there is no plot as such .
there is something
involving russian gangster 
a character
called pete thompson
who 's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant ,
and an irish bloke called sean .
how they all fit into something
called a `` plot `` i am not sure .
it is difficult to explain the plot of guy ritchie film
but
if you watch any of his film i am sure
we can all agree
that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing .
likewise a jame bond film
though the plot are stretched out with action scene .
you will have a serious problem
believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot
that can be cogently explained
taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bell as to what sort of film you will be watching .
sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british film
made in the last 15 year
and she is doing nothing to become inconsistent .
steven berkoff gives acting a bad name
( and he plays a character
called kant
which sums up the wit of this movie )
while one of the supporting character is played by a tv presenter presumably
because no serious actress would be seen dead in this the only good thing
i can say
about this movie is that it is utterly forgettable .
i saw it a few day ago
and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning person
what they are letting themselves in for by watching ,
but by now i have mainly forgotten why .
but this does not alter the fact
that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
