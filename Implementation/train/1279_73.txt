i sought this film out
because i am a new frain fan
and wanted to see more of his work .
first of all 
his irish accent is great .
he is got a keen ear for dialect ,
it seems .
his acting was marvelous 
as usual .
jame frain aside 
i thought
the film was very well done .
it showed the conflict in northern ireland
as the *mess* it really is .
both side are guilty of grave injustice ,
and the man
drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances.also ,
it is interesting to realise that not every man
( or woman )
that is supposedly fighting for his country ,
is really doing *just* that .
for example ,
when kenny
( jame frain )
asks ginger
( ian hart )
why
he does `` it '' ,
ginger can not come up with a morally acceptable answer .
why ?
because ginger is not in it for the noble cause
of protecting his country or the right of his fellow protestant ... ginger is in it for the fun of killing .
he is full of blood-lust
and it is the perfect job for a guy like him .
in a struggle like this there are guy like liam
( john lynch )
who just want to live their daily life and enjoy their family ... guy
that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting .
there are guy like kenny
that are born leader full of charisma ,
and they add fuel to the flame ,
rather they mean to or not .
also 
kenny genuinely believes in the `` cause '' .
he believes
what he is doing will make a difference in the future ...
which is a bit odd 'cause his character seems too intelligent for it all .
but 
like a lot of other seemingly intelligent man 
he is sucked into a gang lifestyle
not even realizing it ... 'til it is too late .
then there is ginger 
a pure psycho
who is not in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it ,
which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset ,
some might argue .
however 
now 
in this film 
ginger has out lasted his worth ,
and has become a very dangerous loose cannon.everything comes to a boiling point ,
and predictably ,
the ending is a tragic one .
what makes this film worthy is that is shows both side of this ages old conflict .
being american ,
i can not begin to fully understand
what all struggle is about .
but 
i do know
there has to be a better way.all in all 
a well acted 
touching ...
but troubling film .
