as a lover of the surreal
( in art and film )
i was pleased to discover this film on ifc .
it is definitely a keeper .
most of the other review tell the general plot
( not all correct )
so i will not bother to bore anyone with that .
the main thing is the alternate world concept
which is ought on by ana 's impending illness ,
and the way she manages to link with someone else
after being so `` alone '' ,
and finally with her family ,
which
i believe
is still at least a little troubled .
it only can be called a horror movie
in that it has frightening scene
but is a fantasy
( with a little hint of `` coming of age ''
only because ana is a pre-teen
who `` hates boy '' ) .
i heartily recommend it to those
who appreciate the stretch of their imagination .
