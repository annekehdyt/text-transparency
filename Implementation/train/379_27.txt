the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me .
i had received an e-mail from the theater showing
it
that it was a great and inspirational movie .
it was neither great nor inspirational .
the cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie .
a lot the scene were flash back
that were done in a way
that could not tell at time what they were about .
the voice were often distorted for no reason .
also many of the person in the movie were far fetched .
the relationship
he has with his ex and son
is never made clear .
also the whole movie has most him one way ,
and then all of a sudden bam ,
he is cured and inspiring person .
the whole movie seems to show
that boxing is one of the thing
that is bad in his life ,
making him live his life the way
that he is living it ,
but
when he changes ,
he does not leave boxing ,
he teaches other how to box .
thumb down .
