i wonder
who was responsible for this mess .
the joke would not have worked for gilligan 's island .
if this had gone to series ,
would there have been joke about auschwitz ,
or would eva have to replace her oven ,
only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats 50 ? ?
another post compared this show to i love lucy .
the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situation ,
and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence .
after the damage the nazi 's did to england and the number of person
they killed ,
i would think
the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant
and most normal person would have killed this concept
before any episode were produced .
