a confused mess from start to finish .
like they used to say about the beatles'song ,
there was a secret message
if you played the lp backward .
if one had the patience
to watch this film scene from finish to start ,
you would come away with the same degree of disappointment.apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashback and false start ,
the clearest character were the movie backer 
out for revenge
if the movie did not get sorted .
there was nothing to like about these two either .
overacting 
shouting and threat were delivered in comic book fashion .
i think
one dimensional was an overstatement.okay ,
so maybe the artsy type are rolling their eye reveling in the fact
that unlike them ,
we plebeian just did not get it .
well i am
afraid there was nothing to get .
and the two cardinal sin of any bad movie carried from start to finish .
a non-existent and pathetic story line
if you want to call it that ,
and by far the worst 
not a single character you cared about in the least .
