while urban cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone
you might find at a rodeo ,
it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age 
in urban texas .
i also think
that to truly critique this movie ,
one would have to have lived in the time and relative place
that it was made .
there was good music 
fun time and 
yes 
a few `` rough and tumble '' at the honky tonk roadhouse .
the relationship of bud and sissy 
like `` two ship passing in the night '' 
was well conceived .
when pam tore up the note
that sissy had written to bud ,
it echoed the tragedy of many true life romance .
the entire story was well thought out .
i thought
the cast and crew did an excellent job .
i thought
the screen play was well written and directed .
scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor .
