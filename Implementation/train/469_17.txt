this movie had no part
that were hilarious 
mostly just average funny unit ,
but it did not have any part
that were really bad either .
the worst part was the voice of sid .
his slothy slur was just too much for me .
by about 5 minute in i was sick of hearing him talk .
aside from the annoying sloth voice
the movie was good .
there were numerous side joke
which if you catch them make the movie much better .
this is a good movie for kid .
it has enough in it to keep adult content and enough in it to entertain kid .
this one is definitely worth renting
if you have kid
and want to watch a movie with them .
