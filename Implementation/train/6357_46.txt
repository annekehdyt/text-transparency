vulpine massacre should have been this movie actual title .
and the tag-line should have read `` guaranteed
to make your kid cry ! ''
this is a nature drama
telling the story of a family of wild fox in a remote region .
starting with the meeting and pairing of two young fox and the eventual birth of a large family and the trial
of raising them .
the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree
that stands over the den ,
giving insight into the animal love and life ... lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animal .
sound good huh ?
well from there thing go straight to hell
and then start drilling towards the core ... *** spoiler below -
or they it
may be a warning !
***almost first off
we learn one of the fox
is born blind .
but seems to get along well enough
and there is a beautifully cheerful musical score
to accompany him ...
and then he dies ... next
we have one of the sibling adventure .
and then he dies ... one of the sister gets her screen-time ...
and then she dies ...
and so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox
after another is killed off by nature 
in trap 
just up and vanish 
and even by a bunch of snowmobile !
by the end of the movie almost all the fox have been massacred .
though mercifully no death are shown on screen .
( least not in the version we saw . )
unlike say
`` tarka the otter '' the death in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hope are built up
and then snuffed out .
one or two loss would have been acceptable .
it is a nature film after all .
but not nearly the whole family.do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box
into thinking its safe for the kid .
watch it with some foreknowledge
that thing are *not* going to go well at all
and that you or your kid may be left feeling very badly depending
on how sensitive you or they are .
you may enjoy it .
or you may not ...
