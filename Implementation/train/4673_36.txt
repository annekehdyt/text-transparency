okay 
here is what i think about jack frost .
i looked at the morphing box for the vhs tape
and i thought to myself ,
this looks interesting .
i rent it and i take it home .
boy was i right ,
it is interesting .
they put serial killer 's spirit in dream 
in walking corpse and inside every day machine .
but this has got to be the most unique place
to put the spirit of a serial killer .
inside the body of a snowman .
i liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape 
the pot holder 
the snow globe 
etc .
i like the actor
who played jack ,
he put some fun into a killer really
not seen since freddy krugger .
that is right ,
i said it .
freddy krugger .
it is that level of `` cool '' .
i wish some of the puppet effect were better ,
the mouth movement could have matched better .
but i chalk that up to a small budget .
the cast does a great job ,
there are some great one liner and scare
to make any hardcore horror fan jump .
all and all 
a great story 
good effect 
great dialog and a great cast .
i give jack frost ... 9 star
