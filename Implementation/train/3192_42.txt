the dvd version consists of 2 episode ,
the parricide of caesar being the juncture .
in addition 
the language was spanish
without subtitle .
hence 
it is hard for me to review in depth this movie
because
because i did not understand
what was said.cleopatra being an historic icon ,
the part is very difficult
and i found
that for a newcomer 
leonor varela just plays fine .
she is strong-willed
but also a very supportive 
tender soul mate .
thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect
and their romance is the main thing of the first episode .
so 
it is not really a documentary 
nor a peplum but a great love story.after the parricide 
a new lover comes
( marc-antoine )
but the flavor is gone :
we remember always our first love .
so 
i found the second episode dull
and their tragic fate is not told powerfully.nonetheless ,
the production is luxurious :
the set are big 
tastefully decorated ;
the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid .
the producer have a lot of money for sure ,
but they spend nothing on the special effect .
they are so poor
( blue screen 
ship 
sphinx )
that it is funny.finally ,
i would like very much to hear it in french or english
to make a definitive opinion about this two movie .
