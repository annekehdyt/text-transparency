unremittingly bleak and depressing 
the film evoke as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness
that characterised houellebecq 's controversial novel of the same name .
like many french film 
its manner is one of wistful profundity
but it is painfully slow -
or should that be ,
slowly painful ?
while this is an excellent and challenging film ,
it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time
when one might be in the 'right ' mood
to see it .
