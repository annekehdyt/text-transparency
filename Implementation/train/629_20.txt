do not even bother with this movie ,
it is bad
when judged on it is own merit ,
but
when compared to the 1972 original
( which is a classic )
it is down right awful .
and btw 
somebody commented
that the 1972 movie is bad
when compared to the book .
this is silly 
movie should never be judged against the book
they are taken from .
they are 2 completely different art form
( as if this needed
to be pointed out
but apparently it does ) .
if you used this criterium for all movie then `` 2001 '' would suck
and so would `` forest gump '' and `` silence of the lambs '' .
