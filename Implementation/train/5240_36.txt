summer holiday is the forgotten musical version of eugene o'neill 's ah wilderness and deservedly so with the broadway musical adaptation of take me along .
with the exception of the stanley steamer song 
none of the other harry warren-ralph blane song are worth remembering
and even that one is questionable .
it was right after the release of this film
that mgm let mickey rooney go
and i do not think
it was a coincidence .
the film was made in 1946
and released in 1948 ,
so mickey was 26 playing an andy hardy like teenager .
he was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old
who was affecting radical idea in a spirit of youthful rebellion.rooney made four film for mgm from 1946 to 1948 
this one 
killer mccoy a remake of robert taylor 's a crowd roars 
love laugh at andy hardy and word and music .
in all of them rooney was playing an adult part .
even in the andy hardy film 
mickey played an adult andy hardy
returned from world war ii .
why he was in this louis b. mayer
only knows .
rooney 's bad casting makes summer holiday all the worse
because in the original ah wilderness the emphasis is on the father 's character
played here by walter huston .
and in the broadway show take me along
which won a tony award for jackie gleason ,
the great one played the ineiated other-in-law uncle sid here
played by frank morgan
and that is the central character.glorium dehaven step in for judy garland as rooney 's sweet and adorable girl friend and marilyn maxwell plays the show girl
who gives rooney an adult education .
in the original play o'neill has her as a prostitute ,
but this was the hollywood of the code
so all marilyn does is get young rooney soused.a lot of really talented person had a hand in this one
and they do their best ,
but summer holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn .
