okay 
i remember
watching the first one ,
and boy did it suck .
after watching it ,
i just laughed it off
and told myself 
`` oh boy 
just another low budget b-movie .
i will never see a part 2 to this one . ''
then 
about 1 1/2 year later 
there came part two .
it sucked even more .
but 
i just laughed it off again
and said ,
`` there is no way
i am ever gon na see a part 3 to this one . ''
then 
about 1/2 a year later 
part 3 came out .
i was stupid enough to rent it and boy ,
i just snapped
after watching it .
god 
i never actually realized
how much movie can suck these day .
just save yourself $ 7.50
and do not rent the whole series .
trust me 
it is worth every penny .
