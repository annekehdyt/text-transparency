ya i rented it ,
so shoot me !
a decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff ,
but at least it is shot well .
director jon keeye takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside .
in most case this should be a slam dunk ,
but this little stinker derails quite quickly .
the cinematography is above average
and the acting is mediocre at best ,
but the story and writing is just plain awful .
slower scene drag on forever
and the scare are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film .
an eerie mood is set at the beginning
but loses it is luster before any type of horror transpire ,
and i found myself bored to death
and making another sandwich ...
the cover art is appealing and i suppose
it is worth a rental
if you are looking for mindless low budget dreck ,
but
if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending ,
reach for something else .
