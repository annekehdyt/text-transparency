nice movie with a great soundtrack
which spans through the rock landscape of the 70 's and 80 's .
radiofreccia describes a generation ,
it describes life in a small village near correggio
( hometown of ligabue 
the singer
who wrote the book
that inspired the movie ) ,
it describes life of young person and their problem
relating to the world .
it reminds of trainspotting 
with a bit of italian touch .
