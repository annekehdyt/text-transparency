if they gave me the option of negative number i would use it .
this movie was truly god-awful .
i went into the theater
expecting it to be horrible ,
and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations.the script was weak ,
the acting was painful .
i wanted to walk out
but my friend was driving
and wanted to get her money worth ,
i think
we were both disappointed.the growing of the east
when the girl got their super power
and changing of the hair color
was just wrong .
eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain ,
he came off as oddly weak and silly .
jenny johnson
( uma thurman )
came off as psychotic and strange ,
as did matt 's
( luke wilson )
friend vaughn
( rainn wilson .
