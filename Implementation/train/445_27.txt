before the release of george romero 's genre-defining night of the living dead 
zombie were relatively well-behaved creature .
they certainly had much better table-manner in the old day .
but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombie offer to the movie-going public ?
judging by this film ,
none whatsoever.the story is about an expedition to cambodia ,
whose purpose is to find
and destroy the secret of zombiefication .
one of the party discovers the secret on his own
and set about building his zombie army.this film is basically a love triangle with zombie .
but seeing as this is a 30 's movie ,
the said
zombie are more like somnambulist than the flesh-eating variety
we think of today .
they seem to respond to mind-control 
rather than insatiable appetite .
and 
quite frankly 
the 'revolt ' is somewhat underwhelming too .
the whole thing is really very dull .
aside from the lack of horror ,
there is not any over-the-top melodramatic theatric
to keep us entertained .
it seems unlikely
that this could have provided much entertainment even 70 year ago .
see it if you have to see everything with 'zombie ' in the title
but otherwise i would advise skipping this one .
