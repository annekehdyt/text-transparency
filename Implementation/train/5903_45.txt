wow 
i can not believe
i waited so long to see this film .
i just never got around to watching it .
the plot has nothing
that interest me .
i know nothing about soccer
( football . )
i am one of those american fool
that has no clue .
i had never even seen david beckham before this film .
i chose to ignore the buzz
surrounding this film at the time
it was released in america .
enough about me .
truth be told ,
it was a mistake
to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven .
what a fun film .
it is full of color and exuberance .
i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie .
parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable ,
you can not help but root for her .
no wonder
why the american television show e.r .
has snatched her up .
i have a new appreciation for indian culture .
those person
know how to have a good time .
the wedding scene are dazzlingly beautiful .
the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accent .
i turned on the english subtitle
to make sure
i did not miss anything .
( this is not a criticism of the film ! )
i am sure
audience worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american film as well .
this is a perfect date film .
it has a great sport plot like rocky ,
and a strong sense of feminism
that is empowering for woman .
i watched it with my wife 
and sixteen year old niece ,
and we all loved it .
i highly recommend it .
