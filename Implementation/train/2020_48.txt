i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlee 's on beverly .
this movie got the most applause of all the film
that evening .
considering
that two music video opened first 
i did not know what to expect
since they were very fast and attention grabbing ,
i was not sure i was ready for a short immediately .
but to my surprise i really enjoyed this .
i thought
the main actor demon guy was really good .
i was so impressed with his performance
that i checked out his name .
i was surprised to see
that this was the witchblade guy .
he is gotten really good especially since then !
either that or he was given lousy role
or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short .
the girl did an okay job .
i guess
its hard since it was her first performance
and being so young .
the dad did well also .
there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short 
both for this and the short playing next `` mexican hat ''
which was also nice ,
but i enjoyed this the most
because it had the most depth and emotion
and i actually cared about the character .
the other was a very simple story .
the story was quite illustrative and dark !
it dealt with real topic
using a more fantasy like approach
to keep add person like me interested .
we will not even talk about the last film in the block
which i left .
my only complaint is that
i only wish i
had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started ,
which is why
i gave it a 9/10 .
i also thought
the end credits went a little slowly .
otherwise it was beautifully told 
directed and edited .
the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowaday .
there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor .
i now will think of him as the sorrow lost actor not the witchblade guy .
