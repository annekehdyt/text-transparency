i said
it all in the summary 
i simpley adore the movie and the cast ... i would give each actor an oscar ... great 
great movie ... i
am 25 now and i watched it 4 time in different period and i always think
i will not cry and i always do 
about 2 or 3 time ... ; ) meryl s. was absolutely illiant 
jeremy iron also..just illiant ...
i wish
the movie
received more award ...
i really do not know anybody
who watched it
and did not loved it ... also ,
glenn close was fantastic ...
the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... i loved the fact
that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much ,
and how blanca was close to her parent ...
