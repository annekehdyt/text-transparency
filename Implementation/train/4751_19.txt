this is one of the shallowest episode
in that the plot really seemed like an excuse
to just have fun .
but 
i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episode to see on a purely fun level .
think about it
-- the crew member have encounter with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland 
a bengal tiger 
a samurai warrior 
a knight on horseback
who kills mccoy 
and a host of other seemingly bizarre event
that just do not make any sense at all until the very end .
despite all the danger ,
you just can not take everything very seriously
-- it is just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal .
so 
on a purely non-aesthetic level 
it is great stuff .
