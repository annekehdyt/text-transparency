or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like amer .
life tv network .
i have been watching another favorite 
`` voyage to the bottom of the sea '' ,
as well as `` lost in space '' and land of giant '' .
they have been showing them forever
but are not receptive to suggestion for other show .
my father and i were big fan
as i was already a big science/electronic nut ,
( still am )
and my father was an old school chum of nader .
they both attended oxy together .
i still have memory of several of the episode
even though i was only 9. more so than any show
that old .
i think
it was televised on sat .
after `` bonanza '' .
some of the episode i recall are the one
where he takes the experimental drug
that slows down action .
or the one where he body surfs the big one ,
( i did that too ! )
or the one where there was a mine cave in
and he conveys how to use mind control
to have the trapped person slow their eathing
by entering a trance-like state .
that is the one show
that i wish i could see again .
i got my wish with the original `` outer limit '' and `` sci-fi theater ... john
