this film makes a strong comment about the italian person of the time .
the use of the mirror
to enhance the revelation of the character
is lovely and i can not not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni .
i love them both .
their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural
that you may question
whether or not the camera is actually there .
the husband 
in his ief role 
is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian
who commands his wife and child but 
in his own way 
a loving father .
the beginning scene with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italian is incredible
and really places the film historically .
i loved the film and i also agree
that it is funny
it is not more renowned .
