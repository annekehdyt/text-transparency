i can sum this movie up using 20 word or less .
way too predictable of a story line with potential
to be funny
but instead falls flat on its face .
see 
19 word 
however 
i did not completely pan this flick with just one star
but instead decided to bump it up to two star due to the fact
that julie bowen is smoking hot
and provided just enough eye candy
to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine
and blowing it up with an m80 .
my advice 
take the $ 4.00 rental fee
you would have paid to see this movie
and just send it right to me as an advance thank you
for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck ,
or you may want to send me the $ 50.00 replacement fee
you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage
to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice .
