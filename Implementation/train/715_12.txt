i love this film .
it is one of those i can watch again and again .
it is acted well by a good cast
that does not try too hard to be star studded.the premise of a newly widowed housewife
who turns to selling pot
to make end meet
could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller .
either would have killed
the film completely.the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor
throughout.it is worth
watching just for the scene with the two old lady and a box of cornflake ...
( no that is not a spoiler ! )
