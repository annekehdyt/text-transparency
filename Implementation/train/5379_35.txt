a cheap exploitation film about a mother search for her daughter
who has been kidnapped by person
who make snuff porno film .
the trail leads the mother all over europe
as she searches for her child
and we in the audience struggle
to stay asleep.this
is one of the countless soft-core sleaze film
that are made for person
who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger
of it showing up on their credit card bill.personally i
would rather have the stigma
since those film tend to be more interesting
and honest about what we are seeing .
this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not .
mostly its person talking about thing
followed by lot of walking from place to place and lead to lead.periodically through out the film various person get undressed
and everything has more than a touch of sandm to the proceedings .
the violence and fetish material is of the sort
to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement ,
its all so incredibly fake .
worse there is not even enough nudity
to keep it interesting .
( basically par for the course for many of these film )
you will forgive my lack of detail
but it simply is a dull boring film
that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur ,
but there was nothing .
the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite
and nose the size of a buick .
i watched her with morbid fascination wondering
what she had looked like as a young girl
and wondering
whether she had had plastic surgery ,
not the type of thing you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller.avoid .
