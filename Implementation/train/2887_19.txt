this was far
and away the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .
it was slow 
boring 
not scary ,
not funny 
not dramatic ,
not entertaining.sarah michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expression of fright and shock .
she could not sell her character
nor could anyone else in the picture.for those
who thought
the grudge was 'kind of alright ' then do not go see this
unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time
and your life.i saw this movie for free by the way
so i do not want this to come across as a rant from a guy
that lost 8 buck on a terrible movie .
it was free ,
it still sucked 
i hated it.avoid .
