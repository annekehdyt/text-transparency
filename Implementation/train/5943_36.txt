i watch them all.it is not better than the amazing one
( _strictly ballroom_ 
_shall we dance ? _
( japanese version ) ,
but it is completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts.i am an english teacher
and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these review rather upsetting .
for example :
the `` name should scream do not watch .
'how she move . '
since when can movie title ignore grammar ? ''
there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar .
it is just not canadian standard english grammar .
comment about the dialogue seem off to me .
i put on the subtitle
because i am a canadian standard english speaker ,
so i just automatically assumed
that i would have trouble understanding all of it .
it was not all that difficult
and it gave a distinctly different flavour
as the other step movie i have seen were so american.i loved
that this movie was set in toronto
and 
in fact 
wish it was even more clearly set there .
i loved
that the heroine was so atypically cast .
i enjoyed the stepping routine .
i liked the driven mum character .
i felt
that many of the issue in the movie were addressed more subtly
than is characteristic of dance movie.in summary ,
if you tend to like dance movie ,
then this is a decent one .
if you have superiority issue about the grammar of the english standard
you grew up speaking ,
your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie .
