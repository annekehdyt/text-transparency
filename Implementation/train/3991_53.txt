seriously 
i am all for gooey romantic comedy
and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as goodfella ... but this movie ?
it does not make any sense ! ! ! !
and i am not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense .
why does her family live in england ?
or 
at the very least 
why does not she have a british accent ?
she is sure cozy with her dad
and he is surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two year .
( on that subject ,
no one ever makes much of a deal
about her being away for so long ) .
and what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party ?
i am not even going to get into the fact
that the escort she paid for fall in love with her
-- that could have been overcome by better movie-making .
i am just saying
that the character 
the setting 
and the plot are not fleshed out enough
to make an even somewhat cohesive story .
oh 
and the worst part 
in my opinion 
is the filmmaker 's consistent use of the most unflattering angle on deborah messing 's nose
-- i would have sued the filmmaker
if i were her !
i mean 
honestly 
i am all for woman
being who they are ,
but why 
in seven loyal year of will and grace viewing 
have i not ever noticed
how incredibly odd her nose is ?
oh !
because those producer are kind to her !
this movie 
like my other least favorite movie ever 
armageddon 
is the fault of the filmmaker 
not the actor .
i can see both messing and mcdermott in these role with a better writer 
director ,
and producer.this easily gets my vote
as one of the worst movie i have ever wasted time on .
i am just glad a friend loaned me her dvd ,
so all i wasted was time .
if there were a way
to make this review zero star ,
i would do it .
