a note to all of you budding film writer :
study this film .
if your dialog read like the dialog in this film ,
please shred your script
and try again.i did not have high expectation ,
but was intrigued by the description indicating
there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory .
the mystery is resolved very early
and the film becomes a straight romance .
i almost stopped watching it at 5 minute 
10 minute 
and at the first eak .
my spouse ,
who is the hallmark and lifetime fan ,
gave up at the first eak .
forest river is a company
town -
the main business is aiken ornament ,
who make all manner of holiday decorations.the patriarch of the company has recently passed away ,
so the company future might be in question .
we soon meet noelle ,
who would rather be on wall street than main street ,
and the mysterious justin ,
who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman
she is inflating crash into justin car .
once we meet alison aiken ,
doing due diligence for the board ,
we have our story setup.if
you can not nail all the story arcs by the first commercial eak ,
you have not seen enough of this kind of holiday film .
maybe
that is a good thing .
