in the old west there are always the man
who live eathe violence and the woman
who hold their eath .
a famous \u00a8town tamer\u00a8 named clit tollinger
( robert mitchum )
comes
hired by the citizen
to rid the gunlinger
( leo genn 
claude atkin 
among other ) 
baronland 's hoodlum .
there he meets the blacksmith
( emile meyer ) ,
his daughter
( karen sharpe ) ,
her boyfriend
( john lupton ) ,
the marshal
( henry hull )
and the saloon owner
( ted de corsia ) .
clint as lawman is appointed deputy to ing peace
and puts some cartel saying
the following :
\u00a8 warning ,
wearing of gun or other weapon in town is banned .
check all hardware at the marshal 's office \u00a8 .
clint finds his ex-girlfriend 
a local madame
( jan sterling )
in charge of the saloon girl
( angie dickinson 
barbara lawrence 
among them ) .
but the town council afraid the raw method
carried out by clint .
at the end
the kingpin landowner appears and attempt to murder tollinger with his own hands.this is a tremandously exciting story of a sheriff-for-hire
who had only one more killing to go .
it begins as a slow-moving western but follows to surprise us with dark character and solid plot .
the tale is almost grim ,
a pacifier comes to a town just in time
to make sure its citizenry
but later the event get worse .
the highlight are the burning at saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending .
phenomanal and great role for robert mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter ,
he is the whole show .
vivid and lively musical score by alex north
( spartacus 
cleopatra ) ,
atmospheric cinematography in black and white by lee garme .
the motion picture is stunningly realized by richard wilson
( al capone 
three in attic )
who made good western as \u00a8invitation to a gunfighter and \u00a8zane grey\u00a8 episode .
watchable result for this offbeat western .
