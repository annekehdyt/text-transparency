this- and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera-was the greatest epic
to come out of hollywood greatest year ,
1939.i will not not restate the obvious-cary grant 
victor mclaglen
( who was a bengal lancer ) ,
and dougla fairbank jr. give superb comic performances.however ,
i want to note two other 
less understood element of this masterpiece .
the magnificent final battle sequence ,
as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple
to blow his bugle
and warn the regiment ,
is simply grand .
it never fails to enthrall me .
yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli 's performance as the guru .
this is no fu manchu caricature 
but an well drawn 
articulate 
historically informed
( `` have you ever heard of changruputra maurya ?
he defeated the army left in india by alexander the great '' ) villain .
indeed 
one can see parallel between this mystical 
evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirty
( a german 
not an indian ) .
gunga din 
anti-nazi tract ?
not quite .
but still 
a tremendous 
funny 
moving epic .
