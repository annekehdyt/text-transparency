i could never stand watching happy day
after chachi joined the cast ,
so i knew
i was in trouble
when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio
( a skateboard chase scene ! ) .
jodie foster in her first `` grown-up '' role turns in her usual professional performance
but that is no excuse for this boring mess .
two hour out of my life
that i will never get back !
no noteworthy character 
unbelievable storyline 
questionable editing and horrendous cinematography
but worst of all 
i could not have cared less .
the story of california teen in the 1970 's 
where the kid live miserable life
and all their parent are idiot .
do not waste your time
watching this ugly excuse for a movie .
