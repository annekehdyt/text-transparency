i have bought 
`` the feast of all saint 
''
and it is not truly a horrible movie ,
but a lot of thing could have been better .
it had a lot of historical value ,
played out by very talented actress/actor ,
and it is not an everyday occurrence
that actor can play out such a role
and have it be somewhat believable .
there were some part
that were a little mediocre and confusing ,
but i would not say
that the entire movie was horrible .
once you think about that 
capturing 1800 's new orlean ,
and making something out of it ,
it pretty hard 
and much harder to get actor
who can strongly signify those part .
but the only big problem i had with the movie
was that most of the actor
who did play the free person of color ,
were mostly light skinned african 
not very universal in casting other
who were not light skinned ;
one of the old creole stereotypes
that still exists .
whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety
when it came to hue ,
despite many creole are color conscious.rather
picking actor
that looked near white in a sense ,
could have been more thought
out.the actor did a great job ,
the script could have better written ,
and overall i found the performance were very believable .
