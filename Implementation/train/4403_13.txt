this movie was not very entertaining ,
certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story .
the character
( except the youngest )
try to emulate the preceding actor ,
and they fail .
the hillbilly neighbor come out of nowhere
as they were not a part of the first movie .
this really sucked 
might have been good with the original cast ,
then again maybe
not because the story is so weak .
skip it .
