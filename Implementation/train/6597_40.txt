from the opening dialog and scene ,
i knew
i
knew
i was in for a train wreck .
did not want to look ,
but could not turn away .
if it were not for the meer eye candy of this film ,
i would have given one star .
the fact
that the interaction between character and relationship behavior were so far fetched ,
added by poor direction
and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster .
money is definitely not a necessity
to make a good film .
but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.if
you were stuck out in the wood ,
your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease ,
other friend dying around you 
stranded in a strange place ,
what would you do ? a . )
run away from everyone
and try your luck on your own .
b . )
have sex with your friend girlfriend .
c. )
take a hot bath to relax your sorrow to include shaving your leg .
d. )
bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel .
e. )
all of the above.according to eli roth 
none of these answer are that far fetched .
in fact 
all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever .
the total lack of reality and illogical attempt
at explaining
what person would do in traumatic situation
throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store .
stay away .
stay far away .
