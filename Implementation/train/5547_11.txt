vonnegut 's word are best experienced on paper .
the tale he weaves are gossemar 
silken strand of word and expression
that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosion .
his word have been treated well once
before 
in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5.mother night is probably one of the three novel vonnegut
has written i could take to a desert island 
along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeard.the film version deserves a 10 ,
but the book are so permanently part of my interior landscape
that i just can not do it ... some of the scene left out of the film are part of my memory ...
