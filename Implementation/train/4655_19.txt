this was fun to watch ,
spookily atmospheric and effect were pretty good considering
they were bang in the middle of world war two .
the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villain getting their comeuppance.it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940 's
when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis -
well made with quite a serious message about the danger
to britain from third columnists.but arthur askey
was so annoying and unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least i did !
i suppose different taste in different time
but the clowning around became tiresome .
if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script
then he succeeded.a good watch
and quite short at just over 80 minute - a good background for older kid too
so they have an idea
of what train travel in austere time was like ;
uncomfortable slow 
dirty train 
being thrown off for no reason 
surly staff ... .
