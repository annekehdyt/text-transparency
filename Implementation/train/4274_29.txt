i loved this movie .
it is a definite inspirational movie .
it fills you with pride .
this movie is worth the rental or worth buying .
it should be in everyones home .
best movie i have seen in a long time .
it will make you mad
because everyone is so mean to carl brashear ,
but in the end it gets better .
it is a story of romance 
drama 
action 
and plenty of funny line
to keep you tuned in .
i love a lot of the quote .
i use them all the time .
they help keep me on task of what i want to do .
it shows
that anyone can achieve their dream ,
all they have to do is work for it .
it is a long movie ,
but every time i watch it 
i never notice
that it is as long
as it is .
i get so engrossed in it ,
that it goes so quick .
i love this movie .
i watch it whenever i can .
