i think
that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen .
robert harling 's script is near perfect ,
just check out the `` quote '' section ;
on second thought 
just rent the dvd ,
since it is the delivery
that really makes the line sing.sally field gives a comic ,
over-the-top performance like you have never seen from her anywhere else ,
and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious .
robert downey 
jr. is typically illiant ,
and in a very small role 
kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer .
i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue ,
but she is great here
as the one *real* person
surrounded by a bevy of cartoon character on the set of `` the sun
also sets ''
-- that rumbling you feel beneath
you is hemingway rolling over in his grave .
either that 
or he is laughing really hard.five star .
funny 
funny 
funny .
