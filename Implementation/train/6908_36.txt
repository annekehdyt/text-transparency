the movie has several story line
that follow several different character .
the different story line do not feel like one whole complete piece
which makes this comedy a very incoherent one
and gets even annoying to watch at times.it may sound weak and clich\u00e9
but it is true ;
you are way better
of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin .
it is more fun and even more hilarious
than this movie is .
i am
sure
both cast and crew had lot of fun
making this movie
but the movie does not give us the viewer much pleasure .
for a comedy it simply is not funny enough and steve and terri irwin just are not good actor ,
not even when they play themselves !
their antic are simply not good enough
to make an entire movie around and their scene 's feel long 
distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.the movie had quite some potential ,
i mean steve irwin is one character
that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch ,
so
when i first heard
that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter ' my first reaction was ; illiant !
the movie however heavily suffer from its weak story and the incoherent story line with uninteresting and unfunny character .
the movie does has a certain entertainment value 
at least enough
to make this movie watchable for at least once but still ,
i must certainly would not recommend this movie.watching this movie
felt like a waste of time .
still this movie might be watchable just once ,
when it gets on tv 
on a rainy afternoon .
it does has some good moment
but the story line really completely ruin the movie and its potential.4/10
