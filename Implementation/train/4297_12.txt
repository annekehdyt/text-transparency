worst .
movie .
ever.what was the purpose of filming this remake
( aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie 's soundtrack ) ?
zombie that *run* ? ? ?
i guess the director never watched the original `` dead '' film ,
which show stiff-limbed
( from rigor mortis )
creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey.and how 
exactly ,
did the survivor know
which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve ? 1/10
