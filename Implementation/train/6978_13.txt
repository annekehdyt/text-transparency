in this day and age of incredible special movie effect ,
this one was a sore disappointment .
the actor seemed stiff and uninspired ,
as was the dialogue .
western are not common fare for hollywood so much these day ,
but movie like `` silverado '' prove
that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one .
considering that 
it is hard to conceive
that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing ,
much less creating such a weak film as this one .
if you love and are looking for a good western ,
keep looking !
