it is amazing
that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlist after all .
it is by far the number 1 worst movie i
have ever seen.not only have i ever been this bored
before
( luckily not for more then 1,5 hour ) ,
the pre-adolescent attempt at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corner of my mouth slightly tilted .
after the first very awkward part 
you tend to hope
that the other part will be at least slightly better .
you hope in vain ,
it only goes downhill from there.the movie has no story worth
telling whatsoever
and repeats this non-story three time .
one can only hope
that by some miracle all remaining copy of this movie are lost forever
and trent harris never lays his hand on a camera again ...
