this is a so
called 'feel-good ' movie ,
however it made me sad in a way .
why ?
because i had the talent ,
but my parent did not let me study at the sport academy 
as well the fact
that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer.and soccer
is the red line in this movie .
together with the struggle youngster have with the expectation parent have .
an english-indian girl and her parent 
with their tradition and strong family ty 
and on the other hand the english family with a daugther
who dresses like a boy ,
and play soccer ... a combination
which worries her mother !
this movie also line out the life of ordinary person 
as well as the indian community in england .
it is about believe in your dream ,
and live your one life
( where did we hear that before )
.paraminder nagra
( a beautiful woman ! )
play yasminda 
a girl
who is not interested in boy 
new clothe 
make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff .
in contradiction with her sister pinky 
complete the opposite of yasminda.a real must it is ,
to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the tradition of their parent ,
and finds her luck eventually .
with great music from blondie 
curtis mayfield 
texas 
melanie c 
as well as indian hit songs.pleasant to watch ,
but if you ,
as myself ,
ever played soccer ,
and never made it to the top ,
then this movie will make you melachonic .
