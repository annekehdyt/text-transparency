this movie pleasantly surprised me .
it has a touching 
slightly off-center approach
that never loses your attention .
this is a movie i
never heard about ,
but
if you want a `` sleeper '' ,
this is it .
great writing 
production 
and acting .
i highly recommend it for audience
who want something thoughtful .
nick nolte 
sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous .
why was not more made of this movie ?
