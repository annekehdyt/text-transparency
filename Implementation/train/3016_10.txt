this entry is certainly interesting for series fan
( like myself ) ,
but yet it is mostly incomprehensible .
the plot is confusing ,
as is the sequel continuity .
some striking effect ,
to be sure ,
but we never find out what it all really means.try to see the `` nc-17 '' workprint version
which contains the gore
that was cut to be re-rated `` r '' .
