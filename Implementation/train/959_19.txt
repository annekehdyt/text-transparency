this two-parter was excellent - the best
since the series returned .
sure bit of the story were pinched from previous film ,
but what tv show do not do that these day .
what we got here
was a cracking good sci-fi story .
a great big
( really scary )
monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit ,
some superb alien in the ood - the best `` new '' alien the revived series has come up with 
a set of basically sympathetic and believable human character
( complete with a couple of unnamed `` expendable '' security person in true star trek fashion ) ,
some large-scale philosophical theme
( love 
loyalty 
faith 
etc .
) ,
and some top-drawer special effects.i loved every minute of this .
