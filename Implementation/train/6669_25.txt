i appreciate movie like this : smart and well-crafted 
entertaining 
absorbing 
well-acted and nicely directed .
nobody
-- even pacino --
is chewing the scenery* ,
trying to stand out ;
one of the film 's most effective moment
( aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp )
is chilling precisely
because of its restraint.not as good as 
say 
quiz show 
city hall is of a similar cloth :
engaging the mind as well as eye 
ear 
and heart .
why such well-hewn entertainment flop at the box office is anybody 's guess .
*you know 
pacino does chew it up in one particular scene ,
but precisely
because it is required .
great scene 
too .
