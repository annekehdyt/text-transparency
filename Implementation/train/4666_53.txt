a large part of the scene should be cut off .
there is a lot of scene
that should have been cut off .
for example the scene
where the hunter mentions `` i got spider on my dick '' ,
`` i like dick '' ,
playing in the mud scene 
or a bar scene
where a professional dinocroc hunter main job is a snake charmer.how about other terribly incoherent scene
featuring a woman 
diane
who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend
who walks like he wears woman 's panty three size too small .
while they make love ,
did not they realized
they are making it out next to the little boy
who will soon run away and loose his head ?
why did they do in a living room ?
i mean his head really flipped .
how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielberg 's jaws scene at grant lake .
all these strange scene could easily be re-dubbed
and billed as a comedy.here in my local town ,
the cineplex theater had been advertising for month about dinocroc ,
and i am glad i did not watch it
because i later found out
it was shown only for 1 or 2 day
before it was canceled .
the movie was that bad .
i suspected
that dinocroc was not a good movie
looking at the preview .
it features the leg of dinocroc
that looks like a child
wearing green pajamas and slipper with claw
and walks up
and down like a 2 year old .
it could easily passed over as baby geniuses.if any student of movie
making wants to learn what not to do this
is a real classic trash .
such as diane 's boyfriend
who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes
you wonder
what the poor woman sees in this guy
who looks drunk
even before he get to drink beer .
when this happens ,
who cares about dinocroc ?
the panty man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of dinocroc .
his acting was so bad ,
he makes a much better replacement for mr. bean .
move over rowan atkinson ,
here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick .
perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood .
