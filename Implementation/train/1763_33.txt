do not understand how these animated movie keep coming out ,
and no matter how good
( or bad )
it is person love it.i saw this movie with my two kid
( 5,7 ) .
they like pretty much anything animated
( like most person
who rated this film ) .
the theater was almost full ,
and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast .
to tell the truth i was bored silly .
it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny .
there were a couple chuckles throughout the film
and that was it .
of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh ,
but just did not work .
my son almost always says to me
that he wants the dvd
after we see an animated movie 
but not on this one .
my daughter fell asleep half way through .
also 
the kid thought
the character animation looked weird .
i have not heard
that from them since seeing the polar express ,
which gave my daughter nightmares.trust me ,
i am not the type
who looks for the negative in everything .
but quality is quality ,
and like so many animated movie
they throw out there ,
it has very little .
