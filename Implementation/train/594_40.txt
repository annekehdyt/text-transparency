david webb person meets paul anderson ...
if it already sounds weird to you ,
then you are right ,
because it is.person is known for his script with moral implication of what is right and wrong 
the value of life 
etc ...
he covered these issue in bladerunner 
unforgiven ,
and pretty much in all of his screenplay there is something along those lines.paul anderson 's first successful movie was a violent thriller .
not surprisingly so have all of his other movie !
and here is a violent thriller with moral implication !
person ' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie .
soldier trained from birth ,
taught to kill ,
and never had a normal life .
they are replaced by better 
genetically engineered soldier and todd 
one of the original soldier 
is left on a planet and left for dead .
there he must cope with a group of refugee ,
some want him to stay other hate
him
and there is an interesting drama here .
but then ... ... the bullet start to fly
as the new soldier move onto the planet for a military exercise
and try to kill all the person .
big 
violent 
loud action ensue and person ' script turns into an anderson action-fest .
it is hard to believe
that the script was originally written
that way ,
but the end product is better then i expected .
entertaining 
somewhat 
though admittedly not very 
thought-provoking ,
and exciting once the action starts .
7/10rated r :
a lot of violence
