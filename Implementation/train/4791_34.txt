mislead by the terrible lie on the cover 
`` fun as american pie '' 
my girlfriend and i sat in front of the tv waiting for a comedy ...
and this is definitely not one .
you probably will not laugh one time
if you are not one of those jackass-like ever-teeny mind .
it is not even an erotic movie ,
which would at least been something ,
given
that it is about sex ... so ,
what is this ?
the erratic plot deal with a guy
who wants to lose virginity
( zero in originality ,
i remember
`` losing it '' for one )
and his gang of friend .
the rest of the character
( i.e .
the girl ) just come and go for no credible reason .
come on ,
there are even dwarfs
( so simple :
`` dwarf are fun ho ho '' ... )
the acting is very tv-like
( as is the video look throughout the movie )
and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girl ... awful movie .
amateurish 
badly produced ,
and over all not funny .
kid and teen will love to watch it with friend
because of the swearing and sex joke .
other than that 
do not even think of renting this movie .
