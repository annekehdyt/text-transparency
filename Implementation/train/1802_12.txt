when the grinch came out i was excited
though i thought
it was going to be a happy go lucky film
and it was .
though it did have a little nightmare before christma touch to it .
you know kind of dark and spooky .
i loved this film
because it helped fill person with the christma spirit .
so mostly the grinch saved christma .
and what happened then well in whoville they say
that the grinch 's small heart grew three size that day .
merry grinchmas !
