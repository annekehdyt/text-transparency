anyone
who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead
who should stick to car chase movie and romantic comedy .
this film is riveting
and does not have a boring moment .
why ?
because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real person in a moment of crisis and detail their effort
to survive that crisis .
i repeat
-- intelligent dialogue !
that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer 's film ,
and that is why a lot of person do not like them .
they prefer action .
fine 
let them spend the rest of their life
watching action film ,
while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out film like this.rohmer
has always been accused of being `` talky . ''
well 
he is ,
but to me that is a compliment 
not a criticism .
shakespeare was talky 
too .
is there a talkier play than `` hamlet ? ''
whenever the subject 
or theme 
of a work of art
consist of idea and conflict over value ,
there must of necessity be a discussion of these idea and value ,
an that is largely what this film is all about .
aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism ; loyalty to old friend
that is put to the ultimate test
when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path ;
the value of human life and the responsibility
to help save that life ,
even if the person possessing
that life is not so nice 
or even despicable .
( anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky 
or `` crime and punishment ? '' )
these are what this film is all about.the two lead in this film
are impeccable ,
as if they were born
to play these role .
lucy russell ,
who is english and speaks french as her second language ,
is especially illiant .
do yourself a favor and see this riveting film .
it may be the last film by this screen master .
