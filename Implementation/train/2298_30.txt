disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie
that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer ,
who was easily one of the last century 's most recognizable degenerates/serial killer .
released straight-to-video back in early 2003 ,
`` dahmer '' is an overtly talky 
boring ,
badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama
that never truly delf into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer
like it had the perfectly good potential
to do !
what it does 
however 
attempt to do for reason
unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out
to be what is ultimately a lonely 
nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser
who was simply lookin ' for love in all the wrong place
as opposed to the cold 
calculating and depraved sicko and madman
that he was !
overall 
2003 's `` dahmer '' is one
that true-crime buff everywhere might as well skip
because i am not kidding
when i say
that it is one of the worst serial-killer biopic ever done !
it is even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like `` gacy '' 
`` bundy '' 
`` ed gein '' and `` the night stalker '' !
