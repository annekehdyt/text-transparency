absolutely one of the worst movie of all time.low production value ,
terrible story idea 
bad script 
lackluster acting ...
and i can not even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive
for how poor joan river 's directing is .
i know
that there is a special place in hell for the person
who financed this film ;
prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal maniacs.this movie is a trainwreck .
( terrible ) x
( infinity )
=
rabbit test.avoid this at all costs.it is so bad ,
it is not even funny how bad it is .
