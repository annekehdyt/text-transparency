the first time i ever saw
this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad .
my dad actually recorded it off the tv .
i must have watched is over 20 time ,
before the relatively recent release on dvd.i of course bought and watched the dvd
and was taken aback
by how much the dialogue had changed .
in the first version ,
which i still have on vhs ,
the mood of the film 
thank to the dialogue ,
was actually very dark .
however the new version 
featuring van der beek et al 
is more comic.to put it another way ,
it is like watching the original us release of akira with that dub ,
before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese.i am in no way
complaining ,
the story and quality of animation are not detracted from ,
but it does raise the question
of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film ... ..
