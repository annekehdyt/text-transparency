what a dreadful film this is .
the only reason
you would want to sit through this mess
is the pleasurable sight of miss eleniak .
the painful overacting of mr mcnamara ,
which became embarrassing at time ,
ruined what might have been a reasonable film
if the correct actor had been cast .
mr mcnamara is no tom cruise ,
the actor he obviously wants to be .
