if you want mindless action 
hot chick and a post-apocalyptic view of seattle ,
then this is the show for you !
the concept of dark angel is not anything new
( in fact ,
there is controversy over whether jame cameron stole the idea from a book ) ,
but i spend the entire hour
watching it every tuesday from start to finish.jessica alba
is smoking and max ' friend
( original cindy 
kendra )
are just as hot .
the fight scene are getting better ,
but the dialogue between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better
( the slang sounds forced
and it sounds like someone
living in the suburbs wrote it )
.in my opinion 
dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for ,
but if you are looking for hard hitting 
award-winning drama ,
go watch `` the west wing '' or something .
