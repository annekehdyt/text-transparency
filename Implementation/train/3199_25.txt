ok.
who ought the cheese .
i love it .
during it is run it became a phenomenon .
the anorexic twin became popular.bob saget started making a paycheck
( instead of his really funny stand-up ) .
and person knew
who dave coulier was .
this is when life was good and simple .
this is one of the great american classic .
it was humorous
and always ought home a good lesson .
and this is where i differ from the norm :
i liked the last few season .
like home improvement ,
when child get older there are a lot more
you can do with the script .
this is why i dare say
... it could have gone much later
than it did .
but anyway .
i gave it an 8/10
because of its wholesome 
funny story line ,
and because of bob saget !
