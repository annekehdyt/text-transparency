to me this just comes off as a soap opera .
i guess
any depiction of profligate person can be considered `` social commentary . ''
but in the final analysis 
i simply do not care how you characterize this film .
none of the character are very likable or engaging .
i felt no chemistry between hudson and bacall .
if there is a love story here ,
it is lost in the malaise .
and despite the twist ending
provided by a complete and immediate
( and therefore 
incomprehensible )
reversal by dorothy maguire on the witness stand ,
the story is insufficient to hold my interest .
no matter how much freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in ,
this story is sleazy 
melodramatic and trite.rock hudson is nobly wooden .
this is lauren bacall 's least engaging role and one of her poorest performance .
dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performance ,
but her character is vile ,
and his is pathetic .
robert keith 
as the loving 
out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult child 
is the most sympathetic character .
most interesting of all 
however 
is the severe-looking robert wilke in a small role as the bar owner .
he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless western ,
but here he is an honest ,
likable fellow.i take my social commentary with an interesting ,
engaging story and a few likable character ,
thank you .
