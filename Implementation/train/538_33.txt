what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe .
that does not rule it out however ;
get a group of lad and some stellas together
and have a whale of a time
running this one again and again
and rolling around on the floor in tear of laughter .
great wasted night stuff .
al hunter home in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s-
that hooligan were well organised
and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable job
( estate agent ? ? ? ) .
but how clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actor straying from other tv production of low quality
( grange hill )
or soon to go on to poor quality drama
( eastender )
can for a nanosecond make us believe
that they are tough football thug is laughable .
are we really to believe
that the icf
( on whom of course the drama is based )
would ever go to another town
to fight with just six bloke ?
the icf would crowd out tube station and the like with hundred .
andy nicholl ' scally needs to be read
before even contemplating a story of this nature .
the acting is appalling
and provides most of the laughs- oldman is so camp
it is unbelievable .
most of them look
as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey .
a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera
who thinks
they can make a flick- go for it .
