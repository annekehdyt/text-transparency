crazed shotgun toting-incest driven-revenge seeking truck driver and obsessive control disorder
`` daddy raped me
when i was 12 '' handcuff carrying ,
all latex wearing prostitute is just a few of the character
you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie
that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station
( ie :
skinemax )
at 4am on sunday night .
( and yes i know
that was an entire sentence ,
but bare with me person ;
this is a long-winded review for a short pointless film )
.filmed in `` somewhere '' canada 
with almost no budget 
the plot to this freak show is trite 
the police in it obviously never heard of `` state jurisdiction ''
because they end up chasing both miya
( hooker )
and trent
( idiotic 
anal retentive 
generic 
insecure college student )
all across the u.s.
( and i thought
only the fbi could do that ) .
the camera is shaky ,
the sex scene are mediocre
and the acting is so bad
it might actually cause unintentional acid flashback to movie like `` ishtar '' and `` leonard part 6 '' .as far as the skin scene go
( which is the only reason to even rent this movie ,
do not even think
of buying it )
there are two of them .
the first one is the only one worth watching
though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and ____
( insert unknown actor here ,
he is obviously done nothing else worth noting )
in a seedy 
disgusting motel room
( the kind with the busted sink
that drip 
and the soda machine outside
that only has blue tonic water left in it ) .
it is all sandm
( riding crop 
handcuff 
hot wax 
and underwear licking )
folk and in the end ,
he gets left in a motel room ,
with no money and cop waiting at his door
( that is goes to show you guy ,
do not let a hooker tie
you up in a `` middle-of-nowhere '' motel room ) .
sadly though 
kari shows no skin worth remembering ,
and that alone can cause deep-seeded traumatic experience for some gentleman ,
so that is definitely a downer towards this flick.as for the ending ,
*snicker*snicker* i know
you probably would not mind
if i revealed it to you
but i will not ,
you should spend your hard earned money for that one .
all in all i give it a 1/5 for action 
a 3/5 for skin
( see last paragraph )
and a 0/0 for acting 
character development or intricate plot twists.- laughing man
