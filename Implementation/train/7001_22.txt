a journey of discovery 
this film follows the life of one family
living in a sleepy 
island town in british columbia .
languorous and dreamy 
the inhabitant are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young 
fresh-faced teacher 
with new idea arrife and ings with her life from the mainland .
slowly 
their indolent state is awakened 
the father
( and principal of the local school )
looks for excitement 
the mother for stability 
the oldest daughter for love 
and the youngest for power .
while not an incredible or ground-eaking piece of cinema ,
the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night
when the wind is blowing .
unfortunately 
i doubt
anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible .
