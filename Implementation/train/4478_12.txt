the event of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape
of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french other .
in my view it would have been better to leave this out .
i think
the director tried too hard ,
perhaps they felt
that the event of the day needed a story as a backdrop .
the comment of one of a policeman - `` this aint f***ing disneyworld '' is apt.nevertheless
it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the event .
the filmaker were in all the right place at the right time 
no other footage from the day matches
what they shot .
