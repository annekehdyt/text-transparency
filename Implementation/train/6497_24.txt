i was able to watch this movie in its entirety
and was deeply moved by it .
i was not sure
if it was really a comedy or a drama -
it had element of both .
mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful -
our image of 60-year-old woman has certainly changed
since aunt bee !
they are viant 
beautiful 
sexy !
the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other character in either the `` mtm '' or `` rhoda '' show from the 1970 's .
i would have thought
that since it was set in new york city
( where `` rhoda '' had been set )
that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared ,
assuming of course
she was still in the big apple.it is my hope
that abc will make this a series and ing back for guest appearance all the old cast of these show .
by the way 
what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion 
or an eventual series ?
was not that the network
that carried the `` mtm '' and `` rhoda '' show ?
