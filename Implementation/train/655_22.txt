does any one know
what the 2 sport car were ?
i think
robert stack 's might have been a masseratti.rock hudson 's character
told his father
he was taking a job in iraq ,
is not that timely ?
i have had dorthy malone in my spank bank most of my life ,
maybe this was the film
that impressed me.loren bacall sure did have some chop in this film and probably out-acted malone but malone 's part made a more sensational impact
so she got the oscar for best supporting role.was loren 's part considered a leading role ? old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoon of his era in that he was a regular guy
who made it big in an emerging industry
but in building a whole town he had forgotten his child
to have his wife ing them up.in time ,
being widowed he realized
that they were all
he really had
and they were spoiled rotten ,
looking for attention ,
so rather than try to relate to his child
he blew his head off.an ancient morality tale.but seriously ,
what were those sport car ?
