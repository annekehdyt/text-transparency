well 
i had seen `` they all laughed ''
when it came out ineurope around 1982
and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it .
i 've just seen it again on tape 
almost twenty year
after ... bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his character and a kind sympathy
which is difficult not to feel also .
excellent comedian and actor 
good line all over and for everyone and pretty good editing 
too .
i laughed and smiled all the time .
just as we all do 
at time .
go get it .
