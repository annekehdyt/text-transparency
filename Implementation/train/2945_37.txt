this is one of disney 's top five animated feature 
in my opinion .
cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film
( as opposed to the compilation film of the 40 's ) ,
and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera return to the film in no other way .
although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally ,
you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylization
-- -a clear time period
the story takes place.cinderella
is more mature than snow white 
and a multi-dimensional character .
actually 
all of the character are somewhat well-developed 
except for the prince
-- left the most flat --
we know
he has a sense of humor 
and a great smile ,
but that is about all .
like snow white 
disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture
-- -in most version of cinderella 
the stepsister are attractive ,
just not as pretty as cinderella ,
and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.favorite disney addition :
the mice !
also 
appreciated the continuity
-- cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film .
the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsister was always horrific as a child
-- i remember
view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it !
the oken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine
to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat
-- -audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villain 
satanic witch maleficent 
in sleeping beauty .
