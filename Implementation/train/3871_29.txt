after reading some very good review about this film i thought
i would give it a watch
and after being very disappointed with the film i thought
i would give it my own review .
this is my first ever
so bare with me.first of all i would scratch horror from the genre
as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest
( with the exception of a few feeble attempt
to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me . )
i would say
that calling this film a thriller is pushing it
as i was not particularly thrilled either !
the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl
who faints a few time .
during these time she visits a house
which she has been drawing ,
after each visit she decides to add something else to the house
to make it a bit more lively one of the feature
being a sad little boy
who is also ill in reality .
as she befriends the boy she realises
that her imaginary world
that she created
is actually better than the real world
that she is in .
until she adds her constantly away father to the house ,
due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.think its an attempt
to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street
but is more like a trip to the beach.in conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab !
