i saw this movie on tv
when it came out ,
and never seen it again .
for the life of me 
i could not remember the title
and just stumbled across it
while checking roy thinne 's movie credit .
excellent 
dark 
and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as `` crowhaven farm '' ; `` do not be afraid of the dark '' ;
and `` satan 's school for girl '' 
all lost satanic classic .
i also think
it has many parallel to clint eastwood 's classic 
`` high plain drifter '' .
why do not they release these great little movie ,
especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage
that fills the discount dvd rack at wal-mart ?
most of these flick have a cult-following ,
so sale should not be a problem .
