i watched this movie
after seeing other comment on imdb 
even convincing my wife
that it was a `` unique horror movie . ''
i wanted to like this movie ,
but was unable to.the `` love story '' was good ,
but the horror aspect was quite bad .
if the story was just about a young man
who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia ,
then it would have been a better movie.the care centre stretched credulity well past the limit ,
in fact it was quite ridiculous .
the doctor happily ignor privacy law and professionalism .
a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient
( without security escort ) ,
and drops the tray
and runs out of the room
screaming for no apparent reason .
the forensic patient
( and the film 's villain )
is tied up in a standing position
fully clothed - apparently for year ?
none of it makes much sense.the movie even had some actor
that i have liked in other thing 
such as the detective ,
but still i can not recommend this movie .
