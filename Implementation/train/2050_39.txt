the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation .
the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation .
lion king ii :
simba 's pride is the by far the best direct-to-video sequel
that disney 
or any other studio 
has made for an animated feature .
it deserved a theatrical release .
the same can be said for this movie .
it has the original cast ,
song by elton john 
a hilarious story 
exciting action 
and touching character moment .
everything you have come to expect from this series .
not so much a new story 
but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa 
and their place in this story .
what impressed me the most ,
was the care
taken in the animation .
all to often 
disney short on the animation quality of their video and television effort .
but here 
they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film .
the scene never seem out of place .
nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa .
matthew broderick 
robert guillame 
and moira kelly reprise their role as simba 
rafiki 
and nala 
respectively .
we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin
as the hyenas.there are many big laugh in this movie .
so if you love lion king ,
you need this movie .
the story is just not complete
without it .
