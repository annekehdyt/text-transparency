fragile carne 
just before his great period .
although it is sometimes hesitantly directed ,
and marred by longueur 
hotel du nord is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french film of the late 1930 
as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director .
all of his great virtue are here :
the cramped interior oken up by gliding 
complex 
delicious camera movement ; a melancholy deployment of light and shade ; remarkable 
wistful set by alexander trauner ,
which are so evocative
that they ,
as the title suggests ,
take on a shaping personality of their own ; the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert ; a seemingly casual plot about romance 
tragedy and fatalism
that casts a noose over its character ; extraordinary performance by some of the greatest player of all time 
in this case louis jouvet and arletty.in fact 
the film 's biggest failing 
and i find myself astonished
( as someone
who usually 
didactically ,
minimises its importance )
to admit it ,
is its script .
it has plenty of wit and poignancy ,
but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacque prevert ought to their best film ,
it can not avoid slipping into cliche
( even if it is only cliche in hindsight )
.ostensibly set in the boarding house ,
the film set up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tale of doomed love 
and emotional 
metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one
that works least well .
annabella is very beautiful ,
but not very good at doing tragic ,
while aumont 's callowness 
illiantly appropriate
though it may be ,
by its nature obtrudes any real 
felt 
romance .
maybe it is just me ,
but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple ,
so young ,
so attractive ,
who 
after only a few month ,
are so racked with despair
that they have to shoot each other .
their high-flown line are rather embarrassing too .
of course 
this affair is not meant to be plausible -
they are symbolic of youth 
hope
and possibility being crushed in france ,
or maybe france itself 
despairing 
resigned ,
waiting for death .
for symbol to be truly powerful ,
they must convince on a narrative level ,
which 
i feel ,
they do not quite here.what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m. edmond 
a character
linked to the great tradition of french gangster .
although we only learn it gradually ,
he is a killer in hiding ,
living off the prostitute
played by arletty ,
having dobbed in his accomplice .
in his previous 'role ' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial -
he had one set of trait ;
in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite .
living a rather aimless life ,
he is profoundly shaken by the lover ' pact ,
and becomes fatalistic 
realising the folly of trying to cheat death.in this way
- the admission
that one is less a person than a collection of sign ,
and that death is an unavoidable reality
the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - edmond
is like a romantic prototype of melville 's clinical killer .
with one exception - he gives iefly into hope 
a delusion
which only strenghtens -
if that is not too much of an unbearable irony -
his fatal resolve.all this could have been trite
if it was not for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet .
i had studied his theatrical work at college ,
but this was my first taste of his screen talent ,
and he reveals himself to be worthy of the great - grant 
mastroianni 
clift 
mason 
mitchum 
cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role
which is more of a conception
( he ,
needless to say ,
is allegorical too )
than an actual person .
edmond begins the film a minor supporting character ,
but emerges as a tragic hero of some force .
like all those major actor 
jouvet 's illiance lies in what he conceals.on a formal level ,
what amazes is carne 's grasping 
ten year before its flourishing 
of the technique of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk 
ophuls 
ray and minnelli .
although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of sierck 's contemporary german melodramas
( check out the masterpiece zu neuen ufern and la habenera ) ,
carne 's style truly fits his theme -
that of entrapment 
paralysis 
resignation.the film 's principle motif is that of water
- the credit float and dissolve ,
the hotel stands by a waterway -
but instead of renoir 's open river of possibility ,
we have a canal 
stagnant and manmade ,
going nowhere .
the film begins as it ends ,
and the setting never change 
except for one ief interlude from which both escapee are doomed to return .
character can only escape through death -
their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow room
they occupy 
the wall and frame
that hold them captive ,
the window
that look out on an escape
they can never achieve .
any hope at the end 
therefore 
is profoundly 
if romantically 
compromised .
