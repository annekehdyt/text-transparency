poor performance by sinatra 
martin and hyer .
grossly underdeveloped supporting character .
annoying talky with no real plot .
ending leaf you flatter than a pancake 
with more loose end
than you could tie up in four sequel
( that is ,
if you even cared about these wooden character ) .
maclaine is the only real asset .
that penultimate sequence in which the `` chicago hood '' search for the sinatra character is laughable .
the music in that sequence also is poor .
and in the final scene
when martin 's character removes his hat for the woman
he called a `` pig 
''
almost made me go outside
and find a stone to throw through my television screen .
