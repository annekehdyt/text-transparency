the movie lacks credence with the helicopter
which did not exist until the 1950s .
but no woman would do what was done here 
even a woman before the woman 's movement of the 60 and 70s .
about the only portion of the movie
that you could believe
in was that germany would want to know
where the landing would be .
ignore for the moment
that the british had captured all the spy but
even if they had not ,
they would not have let one roam around like this just to reassure the german
that the landing would be at calais .
it is not one major thing
that makes the movie not work .
it is the culmination of all the thing wrong
that makes the movie fail .
bad
directing 
bad script ,
no attempt at authenticity
( at all )
all combine to just make the movie fall flat .
generally speaking spy should fade into the woodwork .
the suspense comes in with the spy wondering
if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected .
on this one that game was over from the start .
this spy was doing anything but spying .
your only chance at getting something
that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book .
