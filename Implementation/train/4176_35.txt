there have been some low moment in my life ,
when i have been bewildered and depressed .
sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these.the warning
sign were there .
no premiere
( even the star did not want to attend )
and no review in magazine .
the only reason i
sat through the film
was in the hope
that i might catch up on some sleep.nothing in the film
was explained .
the narration was idiotic .
i cheered at one point
when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot ,
then to my growing despair ,
it was revealed
that he had not really been shot dampening my joy .
i sincerely hope
all
involved in the film
are hanged for this atrocity .
there were some positive aspect ,
mainly unintentional moment of humour .
for example 
the scene
in which the main character 
for some unknown reason feel the need
to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle ,
while telling the person in the next cubicle
to put his finger in his ears.my word can not explain the anger i feel ,
so i shall conclude thus.rancid aluminium :
for sadist 
wastrel 
and regressives only who want to torture themselves .
