this is the worst ripoff of home alone movie
that i have ever seen !
watch part 1 and two 
but do not let anyone say
that this is better than the first two !
i mean 
really 
you do not make a movie ,
then make a sequel with the same character and actor ,
and then make another sequel with different character and actor !
i mean 
it would have been ok
if this wa n't a `` home alone '' movie ,
but they did make it a home alone movie .
culkin is too old now ,
so you are suppose to stop making sequel !
goodness 
this movie makes me sick !
buy part 1 and 2 .
