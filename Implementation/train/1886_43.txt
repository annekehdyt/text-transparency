the first 30 minute of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote 
poised to flick around to watch something else .
the premise of two writer 
down on their luck ,
living in a self-storage-space `` bin ''
was mildly amusing 
but 
painfully bland.the introduction of the character ,
played by joe pantoliano - the big deal movie guy ,
that lives in the park and sleep in a lavatory ,
offered hope
and i decided to give it a few more minute .
and then a few more until kristy swanson introduction as a budding film director and borderline nymphomaniac 
added a bit of spice .
her solid acting performance raised her presence above
and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.ultimately 
the obvious low-budget impact on the film with poorly shot scene 
stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moment .
some of my favourite movie of all time have been low budget 
whithnail and i being one
that also deals with 2 guy with a dream ,
but down on their luck.however 
for my money 
the actor save tinseltown from the `` terrible movie '' archive
and just about nudge
it into the `` could have been a cult movie '' archive .
i laughed out loud at some of the scene
involving joe pantoliano 's character .
in particular 
the penultimate scene in the terribly clich\u00e9d 
but still funny 
rich-but-screwed-up character house ,
where the story unravels toward it is final moment.i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play
and while the film-maker did their best
to translate this to celluloid ,
it simply did not work
and while i laughed out loud at some of scene and one liner ,
i think
the first 30 minute dulled my sense
and expectation to such a degree i would have laughed at anything.unless
you are stuck for a novelty coffee coaster ,
do not pick this up
if you see it in a bargain bucket .
