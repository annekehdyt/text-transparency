it is awesome !
in story mode 
your going from punk to pro .
you have to complete goal
that involve skating 
driving 
and walking .
you create your own skater
and give it a name ,
and you can make it look stupid or realistic .
you are with your friend eric throughout the game
until he betrays you
and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team
( you can pick a team to be on )
and you then start your own team !
there are many level like new jersey 
manhattan 
and even school ii
( not part of story mode though )
from tony hawk 's pro skater 2. you can unlock secret skater like iron man 
gene simmon 
and another skater .
you can create your own goal like skate letter 
combo letter 
tricktris 
gap 
and much more .
you can create the goal pedestrian
and write what they speak .
if you get bored of doing that ,
you can do the premade goal in premade park .
the only thing i did not like about this game
was that sometimes it was hard to drive the car .
9/10 .
