this film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug film of the 50 's and 60 's due to the fact
that it was made by person
that have obviously never experienced the social evil
that they are warning us about .
tom hank and his buddy are `` role playing '' ,
but there are no dice 
lot of candle ,
and then you are just swept away in a bad montage
showing hank falling for the lady in the group .
quite funny but misguided .
i wonder
how many poor kid had their dandd stuff destroyed ,
and were told
that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction .
as a film it is basically an after school special 
bad acting
( although hank does show some of his talent )
and relationship talk 
and no one seems to be having any fun .
it seems these film have a psychological focus on adolescent starting on the road to adultism ,
which is more serious 
apparently ,
and requires you to buckle down
and do the thing
everyone else does .
despite my vote of 2 ,
this is worth watching due to its unique genre 
scare film ,
which i personally find quite funny .
