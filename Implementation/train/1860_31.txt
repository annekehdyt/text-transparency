the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival ,
i thought it intriguing 
fascinating 
the sensitive bi-sexual artist .
so very european 
so very dutch !
i recently rented it for a second viewing
and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex .
get a grip !
this guy is a freeloader ,
living off of society .
i suspect
that the real reason
he is having these fantasy-nightmare about the `` spiderwoman ''
is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year 's of ignoring mother 's advice about getting into car
( and bed )
with stranger !
not only is he making outrageous sum of ( probably taxfree )
loot for making up story
( lying guilt trip )
but he is too cheap
to pay for a hair cut ,
hence he hustles the beauty salon owner .
then he has the nerve to complain about the bill !
but i also suspect
the world has changed alot
since this film was made .
on a serious note
it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont 's camera work and one of paul verhoeven 's earlier film .
hmmm 
maybe the world has not changed so very much after all ?
