10 item or less is one of those 'under the radar ' picture
that is drenched in the simplicity
that most independent movie have :
honest 
ad hoc performance by its two lead
-- morgan freeman and paz vega
who establish quite a complementary if unlikely duo .
the great thing is ,
this entire movie looks improbable despite its 'road movie ' root .
how morgan freeman 's unnamed character psychically
( not physically )
arrives to where he meets this jaded check-out girl
who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor
( who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband
played by bobby cannavale in a small role )
is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter
-- two person on opposite side of the coin of society --
is deceptively simple .
so 
in a nutshell ,
while there are not any bang !
moment of earth-shattering revelation 
this movie is a quirky little mood piece
that probably otherwise got lost in the shuffle of indie
which came out in 2006
but deserves to be seen 
if only for its honesty .
