an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable character twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot
that might be interesting ,
if only you could ing yourself to care .
this `` twisting and turning '' i speak of refer not to the story
( which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole )
but to the director 's inability
to keep the character ' faces
even remotely
centered in the frame .
on the other hand 
angie harmon has very nice nostril and left ear.the only real surprise in the movie is the big name
they convinced to do it .
when you
consider this movie was never released in theater
despite having an all-star cast ,
you might be inclined to think something stinks.and indeed ,
it does .
