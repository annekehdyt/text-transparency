it takes patience to get through david lynch 's eccentric ,
but
-- for a change --
life-affirming chronicle of alvin straight 's journey 
but stick with it .
though it moves as slow as straight 's john deere ,
when he meets the kind stranger along his pilgrimage
we learn much about the isolation of aging 
the painful regret and secret ,
and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation .
richard farnsworth caps his career with the year 's most genuine performance 
sad and poetic 
flinty and caring .
and sissy spacek match him as his `` slow '' daughter rose
who pines over her own private loss
while caring for dad .
rarely has a modern film preached
so positively about family .
