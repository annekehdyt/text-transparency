this movie is a gem
because it moves with soft ,
but firm resolution.i caution viewer
that
although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there ,
it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace .
it is not about explosion 
car chase 
or flying bullet .
you must be patient and instead 
note the detail here .
it is sedate
because that is what the main character is .
the viewer has to watch him
and think
as this story unfolds.i will not give spoiler
-- because that destroys the point of watching .
the plot is what you have read from the other posting :
an average white-collar guy ,
seeking change and adventure ,
sign on for a corporate spy job .
just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside datum .
take it from there.this movie starts at a surreal walk
-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment
that entwines itself with quintessential ,
underlying suburban paranoia.then
it begins to accelerate.the
acting on all part is superb
--
and yes 
some of the act are caricature character .
but they all fit ,
and they entertain .
and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft 
soft key sinister theme :
all is not right at the beginning.and at the end :
all is not what it seems.get comfortable
and turn the light down to watch this one
-- and turn up the sound :
this movie wants you to listen .
