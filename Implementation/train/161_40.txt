every once in a while i will rent an action/adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important .
this is why i own a copy of charlie 's angel
( 2000 )
- not a quality film ,
but it makes me laugh
and allows me to unwind for a while .
one of these day i will probably buy copy of the princess bride and a few monty python movie for much the same reason.in any case ,
i rented this film
because i wanted to be entertained
without being challenged .
for the most part 
i got what i wanted .
the plot was something along the line of a poorly written xena episode ,
and the kathy long 's acting was very community theater
( not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress ) .
there were a few high point on the part of the cyborgs .
somehow they managed to get some pretty good actor to play the bad guy - unfortunately ,
most of them die pretty darned quick.like most martial art film ,
the further you get into the movie ,
the more emphasis there is on action ,
and the plot
( which was not strong to begin with ) deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting .
however 
the more kathy long fight 
the more time the director devotes to her backside .
by the end of the movie i was seriously considering
watching it a second time
just to count the number of time kathy long 's tight red short were center screen.unfortunately ,
there just was not enough meat to this film
to make satisfying curiosity worth
seeing the film a second time .
if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hour
- by all mean ,
go to the grocery store
and spend the .50 cent on the rental .
there are some strong similarity between the show
and this movie.just do not expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hour.unless 
of course ,
you happen to like kathy long 's derri\u00e8re .
then you might want to purchase a copy .
