i think
i have seen this sort of thing before :
college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good ,
all the while ,
complaining
that their life suck.this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bite from what i can make of it :
they practically have the same plot.if anything good came out of this snore-fest ,
it was the music .
that was it.as far as i am concerned ,
i am not impressed ...
but then again 
i never expected anything less .
this movie was directed by the same person
that directed batman and robin ;
another movie
that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow.now for the verdict :
it is a 1/10 .
