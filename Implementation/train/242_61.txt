i truly wish
i was not writing this review .
i am a christian ,
so i waited anxiously to see this movie .
it seemed great
-- a christian movie with some fairly famous star and a plot
that seemed intriguing
( not that i buy the bible code itself --
you can make it say
anything you want .
i do ,
however believe everything inside the bible ) .
so i am sitting on the edge of my seat
enjoying the preview ,
when the movie comes on and manage
to destroy my mood in a matter of minute .
i had to bite my lip
to stop from commenting on the terrible writing
and acting
while i was in the theater
( i would have been torn to piece by the person
cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scene and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scene ,
i am sure ) .
once the final credit began to roll 
however ,
i could reflect .
there were many part of the movie i liked
-- some mostly unexpected plot twist 
some effect
that were indeed special
( i am
not counting the vision .
those were poorly done ) ,
and some interesting technical work
-- fade 
set 
that type of thing .
unfortunately 
i got the distinct impression
that
if i read the book of revelation to a monkey
and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour ,
i could have gotten a better script .
and the music was beyond cheesy
( even for a bond fan
who likes kinda cheesy music in scene of action and intrigue ) .
so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater
-- like the person
who came out crying and eathless
because of how incredible it was --
but i am not someone
who can be appeased by a writer
who throws some word over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it .
i need a good plot and believable dialogue
before i can enjoy most movie ,
and this just did not have either .
i am sorry ,
but i would not recommend this film to anyone .
and that is the tragedy .
when will we see some intelligent christian fiction ?
it has to be out there somewhere ...
