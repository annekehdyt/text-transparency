i love memoir of a geisha
so i read the book twice ;
it is one of the best book i have read last year .
i was looking forward to the movie
and was afraid
that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie .
i was not expecting the movie
to be that bad .
some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie
and the character were weak with hatsumomo
( li gong )
been the worst .
if i have not read the book ,
this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable .
the plot outline of the movie states `` nitta sayuri reveals
how she transcended her fishing ... ''
did anyone see how
or when sayuri became nitta sayuri ?
forget the movie
and read the book .
