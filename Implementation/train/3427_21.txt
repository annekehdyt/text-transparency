return to cabin by the lake just ... .
was lacking .
it must have had a very low budget
because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera .
so 
within the same scene -
you will
have some movie-quality camera shot and simple video camera shot .
it makes for a very odd blend !
i think
they should have found some way
to not do the `` home video '' type effect !
i think
it is worthwhile to see it
if you have seen the original cbtl
because then you can compare and see the difference .
but if you have not seen the original cbtl ... .
you will never want to see it
if you see this one first !
it will probably seem way too cheesy
and turn you off from even caring about the original one .
