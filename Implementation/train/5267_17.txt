i found this movie to be very good in all area .
the acting was illiant from all character 
especially ms.stone and morissey .
tramell 's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute .
the plot is interesting even though ,
this movie is more for the mind
playing between the main character
and how catherine continues her writing with new way and twist for her novel .
the setting was also fabulous
and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious 
thriller like masterpiece .
go see this film now ,
it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,
which was misled by some faulty terrible review about the movie
( before it even started )
... ..you will not regret it ,
if you go see it ...
