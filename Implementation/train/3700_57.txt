why 
oh 
why will not they learn ?
when you have got a nice 
juicy exploitation gimmick ,
use it !
do not go messing around
trying to get all deep and thoughtful ;
you are only gon na wind
up looking foolish.christmas evil is the story of harry stadling ,
who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing
( daddy-dressed-as- )
santa claus back
when he was a kid .
so 
of course 
harry grows up obsessed with christmas ,
and finally ,
when his disillusionment becomes too great ,
he flips out 
dresses as santa ,
and wanders the city giving out toy to good little child ,
and viciously killing anyone
he deems naughty.simple enough ,
and not a bad place
to start .
( after all 
how many other holiday-themed horror flick use the same schtick ? )
unfortunately 
this film wants to be more `` santa 
portrait of a serial killer '' than `` silent night 
deadly night '' .
two-third of the film are spent documenting harry 's slow but inevitable eakdown ,
when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time
the opening title were rolling .
you know
a slasher film is in trouble
when you find yourself urging the killer
to just get on with it already.perhaps harry 's descent into madness
could have been compelling in the hand of a competent director 
but ala ,
we have got some guy
named lewis jackson .
apparently 
this is his only film ,
and it shows .
the action jump giddily from scene to scene ,
without establishing shot or clear view of the actor
to let us know
where we are
and who we are seeing.even
once the film gets rolling ,
we are still treated to heaping helping of harry 's self-pity 
insecurity 
and neurotic behavior .
more depressing than frightening 
christmas evil is one to avoid .
