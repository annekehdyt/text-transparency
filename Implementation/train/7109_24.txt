a truly adorable heroine
who 
at turn ,
is surprised
and terrified by giblet 
wrestle with mattress 
runs full-on into closed door ...
just a few of the moment
that sparkle in my memory of 'the naked truth ' .
i loved what i caught of this show :
enjoyably daft plot and some good supporting character provided the setting for the diamond of the show - tea leoni as 
'nora wilde ' ; cute 
clownish 
and wonderfully accident-prone -
how refreshing to see an actress
who can clown -
it is no wonder hollyood does not seem to know how to cast her .
but where-oh-where are the dvd release ?
the amount
of ( bleep )
they release ,
it is incredible me
that this little gem continues to remain buried .
( someone please correct me if i am wrong . )
