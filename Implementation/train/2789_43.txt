in this truly fascinating 
dark film 
a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money ,
in return the devil takes his mirror image
( this is done illiantly in the movie and eerily presaged
when balduin 
the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror ) 
a visual metaphor for a `` man at war with himself ''
which portents his immediate future .
the student enjoys his money ,
but the woman he loves is unattainable
( he has made a pact with the devil ,
he is cut off forever from love and other rich of the soul )
you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money ,
you can not have both .
balduin is haunted by his double
( the intertitle express this beautifully
as does the action .
some of the scene are incredible 
the sense of doom
when the devil disappears with balduin 's mirror image is amazing ,
as is the sense
that his pact has forever cut him off from human society
( the scene
where he runs away from his double
and ends up in the 'wasteland ' at the edge of the town ,
no longer entirely human
( he has lost his soul )
he is like a hunted animal outside of human society .
there are so many other thing to say about this incredible film .
paul wegener was an amazing actor and director 
a cultural hero of mine .
it helps
if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition
( do not google it ,
get a proper book )
just remember ,
it is a very early film ,
it is a little clumsy at time ,
but considering what it has to say
and it is tragic finale ,
it is one of the best ever
( yes it is ! )
