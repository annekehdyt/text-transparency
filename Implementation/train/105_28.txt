belmondo is a tough cop .
he goes after a big-time drug dealer
( played by henry silva 
normally a great villain - see `` sharky 's machine '' ;
but here he is clearly dubbed ,
and because of that he lacks his usual charisma ) .
he goes to the scuzziest place of paris and marseille 
ask for some name ,
beats up some person ,
gets the name ,
goes to more scuzzy place ,
ask for more name ,
beats up more person 
etc .
the whole movie is punch after punch after punch .
it seems that the person
who made it
had no other ambition
than to create the french equivalent of `` dirty harry '' .
belmondo ,
who was 50 here ,
does perform some good stunt at the beginning ;
apart from those 
`` le marginal '' is a violent 
episodic 
trite 
shallow and forgettable cop movie .
( *1/2 )
