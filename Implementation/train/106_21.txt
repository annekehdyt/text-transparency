i try to be very objective
when i view a low budget movie .
i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget production
versus the big budget production .
i expect near flawlessness from big budget production and their studio .
therefore i apply tougher criterium to the major studio release .
but this movie was just a dud .
period .
the premise was terrible .
the main character 
mary gordano
( alicia silverstone ) ,
was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire
to solve crime .
there was not enough depth in her character or her acting
that pulled you into her world .
also ,
to make this movie more mysterious ,
the lighting in certain scene did not set the mood 
especially in the warehouse.once again another disappointing movie
that i could only give three point to .
