this movie was awful in the worst way :
you just did not care .
you did not care what happened in the plot ;
you did not care about the character .
everyone was devoid of heart .
i ended up walking out about an 45 minute into it
because i simply did not want to subject my mind
to it any more .
there is far too much sex in the film .
sex can be okay ;
it can even make the movie
( hence karma sutra )
but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy .
it was just ugly .
do not see this film .
