this is something
new.there is a coup d'etat
and a couple of irish documentary filmmaker are right inside of it.a democratically elected president
who uses his power to ing literacy to his person and encourages them
to read
the constitution is being slandered by the private medium
openly as dictator 
mentally unstable 
new hitler 
etc .
without repercussion from the government side
( like 
say ,
silencing them via bullet and other traditional dictatorial method ) .
oh ,
and they still claim
that they are being suppressed ,
of course.see how the medium gloat about their own role in the coup d'etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge general
( how much more stupid can you get ? ?
) .and see how the person of venezuela march to the palace ,
holding the constitution in their hand ,
and reinstall their elected government.this sounds like a hollywood fairytale ,
but it happened for real ,
against the explicit wish of the usa .
the documentary is a historical masterpiece ,
shot from the center of the action 
acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporter of the coup :
the good 
democratic 
freedom loving 
benevolent usa
( who still channel large amount of money to chavez ' political opponent )
.also highly entertaining and exciting .
10 point .
