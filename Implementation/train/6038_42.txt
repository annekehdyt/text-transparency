aside from the great movie metropolis ,
this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie .
while at time the film is a bit preachy
and the acting can be a bit oad ,
it is a great film for two reason .
first 
it is extremely original in both style and content .
even in the 21st century 
there are no film i can think
of that are anything like it .
second 
for its time 
the special effect were absolutely incredible
-- using matte painting 
model and huge cast
to create amazing scene of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow .
sure 
you could sit back and knock the film
because 
by today 's standard 
the effect are only so-so .
but 
you must appreciate
that this was state of the art
when the film came out in 1936
and it must have really amazed audience .
in many way 
the set look highly reminiscent of the `` modern city '' featured at the 1939 world 's fair.i think
the movie is also interesting
because it seems torn by the question
`` are person really that stupid or are we destined for greatness ? ''
the end result seems to be a little of both !
how true ! a final note :
i saw this twice on tv
and just a short time ago on video .
all three time the sound and print quality stank
-- particularly the sound .
if this is available on a dvd ,
hopefully it is a lot cleaner
and will provide optional captioning .
as the sound on the video kept cutting out ,
i really would have appreciated this !
