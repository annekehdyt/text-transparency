this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniel and ruby keeler .
when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street 
especially the character eloise
who 's a temperamental star
and she ends up falling and eaks her ankle ,
like bebe daniel did in 42nd street
and another performer gets the part and become a star .
this film 
like most race film 
keeps person
watching because of the great entertainment .
race film always showed black entertainment
as it truly was that was popular in that time era .
the dancing style 
the music 
dressing style 
you will love it .
this movie could of been big
if it was made in hollywood ,
it would of had better scenery 
better filming 
and more money
which would make any movie better .
but its worth watching
because it is good
and micheau does good with the little he has .
i have to say out of all micheau 's film ,
swing is the best !
the movie features singer 
dancer 
actress 
and actor who were popular but forgotten today .
doli armena 
a awesome female trumpet player
who can blow the horn so good
that
you think
gaiel is blowing a horn in the sky .
the sexy 
hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame.adding further info ...
popular blue singer of the 20 's and 30 's cora green is the focus of the film ,
she is mandy 
a good ,
hard working woman with a no good man
who takes her money
and spend it on other woman .
a nosy neighbor
played by amanda randolph
tells mandy
what she seen and heard
and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive 
curvy woman by the name of eloise
( played hazel diaz 
a hot-cha entertainer in the 30 's )
and a fight eaks out .
then mandy goes to harlem
where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena
played by one of the most beautiful woman in movie dorothy van engle .
lena provides mandy with a home 
a job ,
and helps her become a star
when temperamental cora smith
( played by hazel ,
i guess
she is playing two part or maybe
she changed her stage name )
tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior .
when cora gets drunk and eaks her leg ,
lena convince everyone
that mandy is right for the job
and lena is right
and a star is born in mandy .
tall 
long 
lanky 
but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer
who lena looks out for as well .
pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man
but after lena threatens him 
he might shape up .
there are a few highlight but the one
that sticks out to me
is the part where cora smith
( hazel diaz )
struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw
but that is not enough ,
she almost gets into a fight with mandy again .
in between there is great entertainment by chorus girl 
tap dancer 
shake dancer 
swing music 
and blue singing .
there is even white person watching the entertainment ,
i wonder
where micheau found them ,
there is even a scene
where there is black and white sitting together at the club ,
micheau frequently integrated black and white in his film ,
he should be commended for such a bold move.this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed
and it helped introduced me to oscar micheau .
this movie is one of the best of the race film genre ,
its a behind the scene story about the up
and down of show business.no these early race film may not be the best ,
can not be compared with hallelujah 
green pasture 
stormy weather 
cabin in the sky 
carman jone 
or any other hollywood film but their great
to watch
because their early sign of black film-making and plus these film provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person 's eye .
these film gave black a chance
to play person from all walk of life ,
be beautiful 
classy 
and elegant ,
and not just be stereotype or how white felt black should be portrayed like in hollywood .
most of the actor and actress of these race film were not the best ,
but they were the only one
that could be afforded at the time 
micheau and spencer william could not afford nina mae mckinney 
josephine baker 
ethel water 
fredi washington 
paul robeson 
rex ingram 
and more of the bigger star 
so micheau and other black and white race film-maker would use nightclub performer in their movie ,
some were good ,
some were not great actor and actress ,
but i think
micheau and other knew most were not good actor and actress
but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent ,
they just wanted their story told ,
and in return many black performer got to perform their true talent in the film .
for some true actor/actress race film were the only type of film
they could get work ,
especially if they did not want to play hollywood stereotype ,
so i think
you will be able to spot the true actor/actress from the nightclub performer .
these race film are very historic ,
they could have been lost forever ,
many are lost ,
maybe race film are not the greatest example of cinema
but even hollywood film did not start out great in the beginning .
i think
if the race film genre continued ,
it would have better .
if your looking for great acting ,
most race film are not the one ,
but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment
and how black should have been portrayed in film ,
than watch race film .
there are some entertaining race film with a good acting cast 
moon over harlem 
body and soul 
paradise in harlem ,
keep punching 
sunday sinner 
dark manhattan 
broken string 
boy !
what a girl 
mystery in swing 
miracle in harlem 
and sepia cinderella ,
that not only has good entertainment but good acting .
