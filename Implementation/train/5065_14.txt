what a crime ... you forgot to ush your tooth ...
let 's make a 30 minute show about it
and have a couple of kid make some noise
and then have the dad lecture them all
because that is what he has to do.but ,
do not forget uncle joey has to make some weird noise and cooky faces 
then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jean and look pretty for a few minute
while everybody discusses how mother would have done thing
if she were around..yep 
full of zany little adventure about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story
to build around it.full house
will not only bore you to tears ,
but it will make you age twenty time faster
than you normally would .
