warning :
this review contains minor spoilers.well the writer of the first tremor
are officially out of idea .
i am a big fan of the first movie
and the first two sequel are pretty good for straight to video fare .
tremor 4 :
the legend begins 
however 
is a very dull movie .
where the heck are the graboid ? ? ?
due to the relative lack of graboid through the first 90 minute i am convinced
that this entry into the series is suppose to be a `` character study '' .
unfortunately there is not one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago 's character
who is given too few line ,
too little to do and in the end too little screen time .
what saved the 2nd and 3rd movie was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer .
whenever there was not any action on the screen
you could rest assured
that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch .
however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .
on the plus side
when the graboid
( dirt dragon in this movie )
are on the screen
they do look good
but that is about as good
as it gets.i was impressed
when i saw
that tremor 4 was listed at 101 minute long .
pretty good for straight to video .
but after watching it i am sure
that this movie is a good 15 minute too long .
there are long stretch of dialogue
that is boring
and does not further the plot any .
was there a rush
to get this movie made ?
i think not ,
more time could have
and should have been spent on the script.i thought
i had hit a gold mine
when i saw tremor 4 packaged for sale with ... .tremor ! ! !
what luck i thought ,
pay for # 4 get # 1 for free .
well after watching tremor 4 i like to think
i paid for the original
and got this mess for free ,
i can not imagine paying a single dime for tremor 4. for fan of the series
it is best to forget
that tremor 4 :
the legend begins even exists.tremor 4 :
the legend begins rate a 3/10 .
