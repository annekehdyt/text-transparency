i first did not want to watch this film ,
for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film ...
but as i recently had the pleasure
to discover the surprising `` mensonge et trahison et plus si affinit\u00e9 '' ''
which was beautifully directed
and written by laurent tirard
( screenwriter of `` pr\u00eate-moi ta main '' ) ,
i changed my mind
and decided to try it ,
thinking
that `` pr\u00eate-moi ta main '' 
would be as good as `` mensonge ... '' .
and it is absolutely not .
the script is not bad ,
but it is not as well directed as `` mensonge ... '' 
the actor not as generous
( especially charlotte ,
as boring as she usually is )
as edouard baer or clovis cornillac ,
and too be honest ,
i still do not understand
how such crap can have such a success 
even with such a casting ... anyway the story could have been a pretext
to create so many interesting plot ,
but it is not as good as tirard 's `` mensonge ... ''
though it is also written by him .
easy 
unsurprising 
and lazy work .
totally overestimated !
