when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie -
which is no great surprise ,
since it is perfect high school material
and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world.i was a music student and retained strong memory of the production and its song 
as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version
which had ( deliberately )
obscured the elvis reference
and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience.so ,
when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen ,
i was delighted with what i saw .
alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert 
a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain tv series .
the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their role
( chynna phillip is perhaps the only one
who does not look her part ,
supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl )
.but best of all 
the musical number familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie
and performed as stage musical song should be
( allowing for the absence of a stage ) .so ,
if you know the musical
( and few do not ) ,
then check out this telemovie .
it does the stage show justice in a way
which can probably not be bettered ,
which is good enough for me .
what is better than rendering a writer 's work faithfully and with colour and style ?
