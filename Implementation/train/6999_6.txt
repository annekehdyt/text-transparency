this film was excellent - the emotional power of tom hulce and ray liotta 's performance ought tear to my eye and joy to my heart - this film shows us
that there is still hope in the world .
if this film had come out at the end of 1988 
instead of rain man ,
hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar .
definitely a must-see !
