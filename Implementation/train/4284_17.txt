jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novel in the english language
and this screenwriter should of read it .
i hate it
when writer use spark note
for what a novel is all about .
this movie is unbearable to watch
if you have read the book.the whole 'red room ' is so down played
that i wonder why they even bother to put it in .
in the book the 'red room ' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane 's life .
helen burn is treated so badly in the movie i
am sure
she was happy to die and leave early .
in the book she is one of the most compelling character
and she was not the red head .
the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie.do yourself a favor and miss this movie
and read the story
as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .
