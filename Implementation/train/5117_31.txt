christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun ,
because he just can not let go of the concept .
the play 
`` sister mary ignatius explains
it all for you 
''
was presented
-- at least in hollywood --
in precisely the same tone as diane keaton 's lecture scene here .
sister mary was an exaggeration 
a lampoon 
a bitter satire of a serenely confident 
doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun
-- and as played by lynn redgrave ,
she was hilarious .
but the movie insists
that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously
-- while ,
as mentioned ,
maintaining the same tone in the `` explains it all '' scene .
the two approach clash headlong and in the last twenty minute 
the movie goes off the track 
plunges into the gorge 
and explode .
there are no survivor .
it could have worked ,
if the tone of the scene with the four former student 
and their encounter with sister mary 
been pitched the same as the sister mary scene .
or if the sister mary scene been presented more realistically .
this way simply does not work at all .
