the final film for ernst lubitsch ,
completed by otto preminger after lubitsch 's untimely death during production ,
is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness 
romance and music 
fantasy and costume dramatic .
in a 19th century castle in southeastern europe 
a countess falls for her sworn enemy 
the leader of the hungarian revolt ; she is aided by her ancestor ,
whose painted image magically comes to life .
betty grable 
in a long blonde wig adorned with flower 
has never been more beautiful ,
and her song are very pleasant .
unfortunately 
this script
( by samson raphaelson ,
taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e. welisch )
is awash with different idea
that fail to mesh
-- or entertain .
the result are good-looking 
but unabsorbing .
*1/2 from ****
