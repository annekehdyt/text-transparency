another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved child tale 
la bete
( 1975 )
aka the beast try to imagine
( in very graphic
and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way ) ,
what actually happened between beauty and the beast ?
i am amused by many review and comment
that seem to look too deeply into this movie .
i would not go so far
as saying
that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subject
as sexual frustration 
longing 
fulfillment 
or satirical
criticizing of the catholic religion .
i would not even call it a horror-erotic movie .
it is more of the parody on all genre
it touches or mention
even though it is got some shocking moment in all department
that sure will stay in your memory.the long
( way too long )
scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying
but the most laughable i have ever seen in the movie creature with truly impressive ... well anatomy ,
is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti
and is hysterical .
my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated detail of the encounter .
the moral of the scene is - beauty can
and will defeat the monster .
the question is -
who is the target audience for the film ?
for an erotic picture 
it is too verbose ;
for an art movie -
it is got too many jaw-dropping scene of sheer madness and i
would say an aupt ending .
imo 
the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama .
as a parody of art house/horror/erotica ,
it is funny and certainly original .
have a good laugh
and try not to look for some deep meaning .
this story of the curious beauty and the lustful beast certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the child .
the opening scene
that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like `` in the world of animal - mating habit and ritual of horse '' .
