there is nothing remotely scary about modern `` horror ''
which is an insult to the word `` horror '' .
freddie vs jason 
the scream movie 
cabin trash 
and especially stephen king 's infantile attempt - he is recycled every story from the monkey 's paw to whatever 
often in the same story - at horror in both writing and on film
( except for kuick 's version of the shining
which actually was scary ,
unlike king 's book
which are as frightening
as my big toe - the left one ,
which still has the nail.but
the woman in black is that rare modern film
that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end .
this is the way
it should be done ;
the director creates tension 
and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other
with that incredible look on her face .
then he ings it all to a ghastly disturbing close .
he is learned his lesson from the master
who knew
how to make horror - val lewton
( original cat person )
and robert wise
( a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher ) ,
jacque tournier
( another val lewton disciple
who directed a truly horrifying zombie film 
not the gross rubbish raimi did
( gross is not scary 
folk ,
it is just gross ) ,
and lewis allen
( the uninvited ) ,
and of course jack clayton 's turn on henry jame the innocent ,
and the way the master of suspense 
hitchcock 
can still ing you to the edge of your seat even with a slow-building and burning period piece like under capricorn.ten star ...
