it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter 's halloween .
as a kid 
i remember i really enjoyed the sequel 
especially the return of michael myer ,
which i still think
is the best halloween sequel .
but i thought
the first one was slow
and took way too much time
to get to the point\u00ad .
i watched it a couple of time recently
and i know
now i was wrong .
today i truly understand this film ,
the meaning it has ,
the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece .
it is not about blood and gore .
it is not about naked chick and lame joke .
it is about the worst night in laurie strode 's short life .
it is about the night his demented other comes back home
to finish what he started 15 year ago .
this movie is meant to be scary
and i think
it succeeds very well .
it is also one of the first slasher movie 
a horror sub-genre
that i always loved .
halloween has a very dark atmosphere 
creepy music and talented young actor 
such as jamie lee curtis in her first role .
need i say more ?
anyone
who 's never seen it 
horror fan or not ,
should do his cinematic homework right now .
very highly recommended !
