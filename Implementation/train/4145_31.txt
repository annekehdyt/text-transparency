i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 min of roll.roll is about a country boy 
mat
( toby malone )
who has dream of becoming a sport star .
mat travel to the city
and is to be picked up by his cousin george
( damien robertson ) .
well 
that was the plan anyway .
george is involved with a gangster 
tiny
( john batchelor )
and is making a delivery for him .
needless to say ,
mat gets dragged into george 's world .
i thought
it was great how mat teach george some moral and respect
while george teach mat how to relax and enjoy life a little .
toby and damien were well cast together
and did an outstanding job.every character in the movie complimented each other very well ,
the two cop were great .
david ngoombujarra ought some great comic relief to the movie .
tiny played a likable gangster
that reminded me of one of my favourite character 'pando ' from two hands.one of the other thing
that i liked about roll was that it showcased the city
that i grew up
and lived in for 20 year 
perth and fremantle .
it was good to see sight and landmarks
that i grew up with 
especially the old ferris wheel.this rocks 'n ' roll
