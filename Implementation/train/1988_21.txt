i must admit i am a big fan of south park
and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good
as it turned out to be !
i think
this is what happens
when you mix david zucker 
matt stone 
and trey parker together .
this movie has so much replay value and at no point
bother to take itself seriously .
the slap stick style humor
mixed with stone and parker
just works flawlessly .
the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time
of it is release
and had it come out today
it would be a hit .
do not bother trying to be critical ,
just leave your ain at the door
and expect endless laugh to come .
recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor .
