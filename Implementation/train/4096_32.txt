this film is an absolute classic for camp .
that is why
it was an elvira and mst3000 classic .
everyone knows the story .
scientist keeps his girlfriend 's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement
while he cruises town
and try to find her a body by checking out the local chick .
finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick 's head on top .
the severed head makes friend with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant 's remaining `` good '' arm
( his other is not right from a scientist 's earlier failure ) ,
and the whole place burns down.the movie scared us so much as kid
that my friend would not go into his basement for a year
after seeing it .
as kid we ranked the scariest movie of all time
and this one was number four .
only one of those scary movie was really any good
( the original `` the haunting '' .
) i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers .
its eerie effect
because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle
when the scientist looks for the body
( complete with porno sound track )
scares the hell out of innocent child ,
while the ridiculous aspect make
it prime material for watching talking and laughing .
i could watch this film tonight
and enjoy it
while i would rather go to the dentist than watch `` chicago '' again.seven is the most i can give it ,
because its entertainment value is mere luck .
the film 
as cinema 
is a disaster .
