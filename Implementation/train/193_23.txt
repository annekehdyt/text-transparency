i was surprised
when i saw this film .
i would heard
it was the best ever filmed of the novel .
how disappointed
i was.how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eye .
the scriptwriter have decided to stick in bit of ridiculous humour
which are embarrassing at the best of time ,
but also ruin the feel of the period .
as for the cast :
gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine
( but then any 'hot ' american star would be questionable in the role ) ,
toni collette is miscast ,
and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughable !
i really could not say a good thing about this film .
i seem to be among the very few
who do not rate it ,
but
if you want my advice ,
see instead the tv production
starring kate beckinsale -
believe me ,
that is far preferable to this superficial trash .
