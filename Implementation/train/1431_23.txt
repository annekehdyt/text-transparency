i really liked this movie !
even though it was not anything like any of the book
it still the that classic nancy drew style .
i had been seeing a lot of advertisement for this movie
and since i was really into the nancy drew book i had really high expectation for this movie
and they most definitely met those expectation .
pretty much all of the character were exactly
how i pictured them from reading the book .
i am really happy
that i saw this movie .
all of the actor and actress really acted
like they acted like in the book series .
ever
since i saw this movie i
have wanted to read every single nancy
drew
book there is out there .
all of the actor and actress really got into their character
and it definitely showed
when the aired this movie on the big screen .
it definitely seemed like all of the actor
and actress were really in the position
that the character were in i most definitely give this movie a 10/10 .
