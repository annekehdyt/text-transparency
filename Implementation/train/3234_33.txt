not even timothy hutton or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film .
for starter 
the script was definitely written to be made into a b-film 
but somehow duchovny
( looking for a star vehicle
to elevate himself out of television )
and hutton
( looking for the `` two '' of a `` one-two punch ''
he had hoped
would define his career after `` ordinary person '' )
became attached to the picture .
cheesy line 
big bad wipe from scene to scene
( come on
-- who uses wipe
after 12th grade telecommunication class ?
) ,
and plain old bad acting sink this film .
even duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague
that is this film .
only timothy hutton rises above the material at all .
i must admit feeling duchovny 's pain
as he read the line
that are the voice-over .
while i found myself laughing
when i am sure
the director wanted me to feel terrified ,
nothing prepared me for the closing line of duchonvey 's voice-over :
`` if you ever need a doctor ,
be sure to call 911 . ''
if only the studio had called 911 ,
this dog of a motion picture would never have been made .
avoid at all cost .
