it is a colorful slasher movie .
that is about it.it has the mystery element
that scream made so popular in slasher movie ,
but i never care for such thing .
figuring out
who 's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clue are all misleading anyway.the death scene
were inventive and gorey 
inging back memory of 80 's horror movie like friday the 13th .
another nice thing about this movie is that it is hard to pinpoint the surviving girl 
unlike in scream and ikwydls
where it was obvious .
person
who do not like slasher movie
will not like this movie .
as simple as that .
i truly enjoyed it
and i plan to watch it again
while waiting for more of the same .
