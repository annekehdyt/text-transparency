the director state in the behind-the-scenes feature
that he loves horror movie .
he loves them so much
that he dedicated the movie to dario argento 
as well as other notable director such as george a. romero and tobe hooper .
basically dedicating this movie to those great director
is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for mother 's day .
the first thing
they did wrong
was the casting .
cast person that can act .
also 
do not cast a person
that is 40 year old for the role of a misunderstood 
18 year old recluse .
that is right ,
he is been in high school for 22 year .
the reaction made by person
as they watch their boyfriend get their heart ripped out
is amusing .
or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn
( haha get it ) ,
and his girlfriend just goes ,
`` oh..my..
god ? ''
the scarecrow himself is quite a character .
doing flip off car
and calling person losers.the movie does have one redeeming factor ... oh wait ,
no it does not.if you absolutely must see this movie ,
than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd .
it covers about everything
and has a really gnarly song dude .
