picture the scene :
a mountainous alien landscape .
twin moon illuminate the blood red sky .
the tardis lands ,
and out step the doctor 
a middle-aged man in a victorian frock coat ,
and rose 
his companion from earth .
a flicker of recognition cross his face .
`` well 
i never !
its the planet saurious-7 .
where i fought the warlike kraggartian .
they tried to use giant skinkon
to take over the planet . `` .
the girl sniffs the air .
`` can not we go 
doctor .
i do not like the look of this place .
i keep thinking
we are being watched . `` .
the doctor wags a disapproving finger .
`` do not be silly 
girl .
i wonder
if the king and queen of cordaraby city remember me from my last visit .
come along 
rose 
come along ! `` .
he strides off 
the girl struggles to keep up .
high on a hill 
sinister red eye regard them with hatred ...
that was not how 'rose ' began back in 2005 ,
and thank heaven for that say
i. unfairly derided at the time of its original u.k. oadcast 
'rose ' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode ,
putting 'dr.who ' back where it belonged 
as one of the b.b.c .
's flagship programme .
the mistake made by the mcgann t.v .
movie were well learnt .
instead of trying to shoehorn the new 'who ' into existing chronology ,
it represented a fresh start for the series ,
beginning with shop girl rose tyler
( billie piper )
going about her daily routine .
one day she goes to the basement
to find a man
named wilson ,
and then the trouble begins .
mannequin come to life and attack her .
it is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger
( christopher eccleston )
that she is saved .
the story 
slight
though it may be ,
is more than adequate as a starting-point for the series .
the auton are 
of course 
an old villain
( this was their first appearance since 1971 ) ,
but no reference are made to their past appearance - another wise move .
the finale effectively recreated the famous scene in 'spearhead from space '
when shop window dummy sprang to life .
as the doctor 
christopher eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessor 
preferring a modern leather jacket to the doctor 's traditional period clothe ,
but this made him more accessible to the show 's hoped-for new audience .
billie piper confounded her critic
by making a big impression as 'rose ' .
also good was noel clarke as her boyfriend 'mickey'.yes ,
there was an added emphasis on special effect ,
but then there needed to be - the wobbly set and unconvincing monster of the past have no place on 21st century television .
what is more important
is how good a script this is .
ten million person tuned in to see the new doctor .
'dr.who ' was back - and back with a bang !
