black guy becomes rich white guy ,
and rich white guy seems to emace hip-hop culture ,
and most of the `` funny '' moment of this film play off of this .
the problem i have is
that it does not work
and almost never works.ok ,
so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charle wellington .
that would be too much to ask .
i will grant that .
but at the same time 
it goes too far the other direction .
i am supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending thing ,
playing like he is a bastion of hip-hop culture ,
and person just *accept* him ?
and what about sontee ,
who falls in love with him *as a rich white guy* ,
even though she does not care about his money or power ?
this is so completely unbelievable
it is not even funny.i just could not suspend disbelief and i could not finish the movie .
i added one extra star
because it did make me laugh 
even hard 
a couple of time .
but i just could not get get past the whole `` white guy
doing hip hop '' thing
that has never been well done in any movie i
have ever seen
that tries it .
this was no exception .
