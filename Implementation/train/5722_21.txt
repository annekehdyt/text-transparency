had this movie been made just a few year later ,
i would have knocked down the score a point or two
because the sound quality was rather poor .
at time 
the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes
( normal ambient sound are missing ) .
but ,
given it was 1931 and a french movie ,
this is quite forgivable .
especially since this also occurs in later french film
-- by which time
the sound difficulty
should have been worked out completely
( such as in l'atalante from 1934 ) .okay ,
apart from some minor sound problem ,
this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of person
trying to get it .
and 
during the search there are lot of jaunty little song
that you can not help but like .
a nice charming film all-in-all .
