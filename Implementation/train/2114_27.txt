this film was pure pain .
sitting in the theater for x-amount of minute ,
i was wondering
when the film was going to start .
all the setup were in place ;
typical love story 
character have to overcome their short-giving ,
villain has to emerge ,
but none of it ever initiated .
by the time these thing happened 
i was already bored stiff
and the device were completely ineffective .
in scene
that required immense tension and buildup ,
it felt like necessary frame were cut .
kid 's stuff does not have to be this way .
child 's film can be as riveting and engaging as adult one .
the excuse 
`` hey 
its for kid 
'' is bull .
i will take `` sword in the stone '' any day .
this was terrible .
i am getting the feeling
that disney will put out anything these day .
and as for the kid 
the 10-year i saw this with will agree ... pure trash .
