really ,
when it comes down to it ,
this movie is just not funny .
josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny ,
and
yet he thinks
he is hilarious .
the plot about mailing the 17 letter was fine at first ,
until josh 's `` look at me 
i am wacky '' approach began infesting each and every scene .
the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing
i have ever been privy to ,
and that is saying quite a bit ,
since it does have stiff competition from all the other joke in the movie .
and as for the incredible overuse of the pixie ' `` debaser 
'' i have just one thing to say :
what did the pixie ever do to deserve a fate like this ?
what did anyone do to josh kornbluth
to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a terrible movie ?
