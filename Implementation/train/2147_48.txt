in 1925 
childhood friend marie dressler
( as maggie warren )
and polly moran
( as lizzie praskin )
oversee the wedding of their child 
anita page
( as helen )
and norman foster
( as john ) .
before the celeation 
ms. dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son 
mr. foster .
six year later 
the great depression ings many bank closure 
and financial insecurity .
banker foster is able to survive 
due to mother dressler 's wise planning .
but 
ms. moran is worried about her fortune ,
and loudly demands a complete withdrawal .
other `` warren bank '' customer hear moran 's rant ,
and start questioning their own solvency .
soon 
the family is in financial crisis.dressler 's huge critical and financial film
hit `` emma '' had been released early in the year ,
and mgm had to have wanted to get a new dressler film out as soon as possible .
dressler 's 1931 hit ,
`` reducing '' and `` politic '' were still making a lot of money ;
and 
dressler had become 1932 's us # 1 box office star ,
according to the industry standard list
compiled by quigley publication .
`` prosperity '' certainly celeated dressler 's status ,
but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy 
and rushed .
the cast does well 
considering .
some more care in direction and editing 
and some retake 
would have helped apparently ,
they needed it in theater for the holiday .
**** prosperity
