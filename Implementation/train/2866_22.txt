this is an excellent 
hearteaking movie .
it is by far the best i
have seen
that depicts the current reality in latin america ... kidnapping 
corruption 
ruthless and greedy police official and heartless mayhem toward innocent victim .
denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career 
in my opinion .
dakota fanning is an amazing young actress .
the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed ,
i believed every minute .
the cast is illiant 
christopher walken ,
mickey rourke are great as always .
walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor .
i would have loved to see more of both of them .
the authentic location are remarkable .
the camera work is interesting and different .
there are many famous latin actor in the cast ,
making it all the more interesting for person familiar with latin american cinema .
i highly recommend this movie .
