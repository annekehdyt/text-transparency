utterly pretentious nonsense .
the material is dull 
dull 
dull ,
and most of the cast would not even have made understudy in allen 's earlier film .
and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate
( though mysteriously popular )
ferrell even more .
it appears
that the morose 70-year old allen should have knocked off work
when the clock rang in a new century.i truly tried to get involved in the film ,
but it was just impossible ;
my snyapse could not fire that slowly .
so 
rather than doze off
and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position
i got up ,
left my wife and daughter in the theater ,
and went out to the car
where i had a really good book to re-read
( george bailey 's great tome of 30 year ago 
`` german . '' )
the day turned out pretty well after all 
no thank to woody .
