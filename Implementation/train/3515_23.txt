as with that film we follow the implausible
if always engaging adventure of the 2 lead character .
but whilst c + j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood 
this pair revel in their carnality even to the point
of exploring homoeroticism .
most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partner and yet ,
despite their deeply un-pc behaviour ,
everyone emerges smiling .
like c + g 
through it all they remain innocent at heart 
rebel against the quotidien 
the bourgeois 
the restrictive .
as someone else has commented ,
i would not want to know these 2
and it is a minor miracle
that their trip ings scene of mostly comedy and very little tragedy
( and what there is of that can not be laid at their door )
and thus for that reason 
it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth .
dare i say
that only the french can get away with film like this .
and that is part of their genius .
