shame really - very rarely do i watch a film
and am left feeling disappointed at the end .
i have seen quite a few of ira levin 's adaptation - 'rosemary 's baby ' and 'the stepford wife ' - and liked both them ,
but this just did not appeal to me.when i read the plot outline
- an award winning playwright
( michael caine )
decides to murder one of his former pupil
( christopher reeve )
and steel his script for his own success - i was excited .
i like thriller 
michael caine 's a good actor 
sidney lumet 's a good director and ira levin 's work is generally good.i will not spoil it for anyone
who has not seen it yet ,
but all i would say
is there are load of twist and turn .
so many its kind of hard
to explain the film 's plot line in detail ,
without giving it away .
i enjoyed the first ... 45 minute ,
before the twist and turn began to occur
and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out .
though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending
which did make me laugh out loud.the main cast - michael caine 
christopher reeve 
dyan cannon and irene worth
- were all illiant in their role .
though worth 's obvious fake russian accent got on my nerve slightly
( nothing personal irene ,
i think
any actor 's fake accent would irritate me ) .
not sure
if cannon 's character was meant to be annoyingly funny
but dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time.anyone
reading this - i do not want you to be put-off watching this
because of my view - give it a chance ,
you may like it ,
you may not .
it is all about opinion .
