i saw this film
and heard the writer-director 
juan gerard 
speak at the santa barbara int'l film festival.all i
knew about it
was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958
and how it affects his home and family.it opening scene will ing to mind `` cinema paradiso '' .
in fact 
the film is filled with reference to classic film :
the roulette wheel
( casablanca ) ,
`` chicken clucking ''
( rebel without a cause ) ,
reference to bunuel 
`` touch of evil '' ;
you will find more .
the homeless man
( georg stanford brown )
is a reference to cuban folklore
which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus.what this film
really is is the culmination of a dream .
gerard 's wish to honor his family and medium of film
that
he has loved all of his life.this
is the true story of juan gerard
and all the person in it are real ,
as are the event depicted .
gerard is actually an architect and engineer
( and passionate film lover )
but his dream was to make this movie .
he and his wife decided to live
that dream and harvey keitel became an `` angel ''
who believed in gerard
and agreed to produce and star in it .
keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather `` che '' .
brown and keitel are the only american in the cast .
iben hjejle
( high fidelity )
and gael garcia bernal
( y tu mama tambien )
offer strong support in key roles.truthfully 
the first half of the film suffer from stiff delivery of line 
and some overracting ,
but stay with it .
the last half is much better as the event of the revolution combine for the bittersweet 
and honest climax .
it is the first effort of juan gerard ,
but it is honest
as he is and his passion and heart really come through 
in this sincere first effort .
i would definitely see it again ,
and hope
that he continues his film career .
