was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film
and loved every minute of the filming .
went to the premier in london
and had a great chat to phil 
peter 
martin ,
and jon as did my wife.fantastic after party too .
then a few week later had trip to the cinema with member of our bike club .
what a illiant film 
it deserves to be up there with all the great biker film .
now we have the dvd sue my wife can not get enough
of it neither can the kid .
get a bit of stick from the club
who seem to think
i am a film star now oh well one can only dream .
i think
they are just jealous .
the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather 
rain 
rain and more rain
but hey we was in wale .
hopefully there will be a follow up
so keep me posted jon .
