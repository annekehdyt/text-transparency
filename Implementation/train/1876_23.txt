it is hard to describe bug in word ,
it is one of those film
that truly has to be seen to be understood .
it follows a narrative
that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release .
as its character react to the chain of event in different way ,
and as the event dictate different path for the character to follow ,
the audience is merely an observer .
the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought 
the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen ,
waiting anxiously to see
how it all works out in the end .
and as far as the thematic element ... there is a particular sequence in the film
that goes from melancholy 
to ight and beautiful ,
and then to tragic ,
all within the span of about a minute .
and it works.this movie is pure magic .
it reminds one
why independent film is perhaps the ightest star
the film industry currently has .
perhaps with more movie of bug 's quality ,
person will start to take notice .
