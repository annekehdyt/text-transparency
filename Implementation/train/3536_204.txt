some have praised _atlantis :
_the_lost_empire_ as a disney adventure for adult .
i do not think so
-- at least not for thinking adult.this script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie ,
that struck someone
as the type of crap you can not sell to adult anymore .
the `` crack staff '' of many older adventure movie has been done well before ,
( think _the dirty dozen_ )
but _atlantis_ represents one of the worse film in that motif .
the character are weak .
even the background
that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best .
an md/medicine man 
a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted son ,
if we have not at least seen these before ,
we have seen mix-and-match quirk before .
the story about how one companion 
vinny played by don novello
( fr .
guido sarducci ) ,
went from flower store to demolition totally unconvincing.only the main character 
milo thatch 
a young atlantis-obsessed academic
voiced by michael j. fox ,
has any depth to him .
milo 's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him .
the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee ,
as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head.and
while the character were thin at best ,
the best part about _atlantis_ was the voice talent .
perhaps milo 's depth is no thicker than fox 's charm .
commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by jame garner .
although rourke is a pretty stock military type ,
garner shows his ability to eath life into character simply by his delivery .
garner 's vocal performance is the high point .
i am sorry to say
leonard nimoy 's dying king is nothing more than obligatory .
additionally 
don novello as the demolition expert 
vinny santorini 
was also notable for one or two well-done 
funny line
-- but i have always liked father guido sarducci 
anyway .
also well done was the computer animation .
the background animation ,
that is .
the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism
that drove don bluth out the door .
the character animation does nothing
if not make already flat character appear even flatter .
aside from landscape 
building and vehicle there is not much to impress.the plot
was the worst .
some say hackneyed or trite .
i am not so sure about that .
any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment .
shakespeare often started from a known story and plot
and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint .
so the treatment is the thing .
and _atlantis_ obviously lacks that.i can not begin to go into all the logic gap
without a spoiler section .
the plot was bad .
the plot 's idge snap like twine and the ending does not make sense .
to add to that ,
the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness .
** spoiler **1. right at the beginning
when milo reveal
that runic or celtic symbol have been wrongly transliterated
and the `` coast of ireland '' should read the `` coast of iceland '' ,
we begin to have problem .
the writer of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as `` ireland '' ,
and completely ignore the older 
latin term hibernia .
but more than this 
they need to know of the viking conspiracy
to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland .
by making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated `` letter '' ,
the writer have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post-roman date on the script .
since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave .
and without visible clue and less technology than milo had ,
made the inscription far less trustworthy.2 .
the shepard 's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis ,
or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying `` in the king 's eye '' .
it must have been written after the sinking ,
but without even the technology
that milo 's expedition had ,
how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan .
so how could it know more about anything after that ?
and why would it be written in atlantian ?
automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these thing .
however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian .
so it is got to be some sort automatic writing .
since noone left in atlantis can read ,
it must be the spirit of the crystal beaming message to the surface .
this would have made more sense .
but could also have been explained within the movie :
milo could have discovered
that this power had been calling him all his life
-- appeared in dream 
etc .
this needed to be explored in the movie.3 .
the atlantian should simply not be able to comprehend modern language .
no-one expects
that the original indo-european would be able to converse in europe ,
anymore than roman would understand
that hard `` c '' s or their day became french `` ch '' s
( pronounced like `` sh '' s 
no less ! )
4 .
current atlantian were alive before the cataclysm
-- when apparently they *could* read ,
yet now are unable to read what they used to 
or operate similar machinery .
5. the mass illiteracy point out a crucial flaw in the movie .
nothing seems to have happened to this culture .
it seems suspended in air
until milo can rescue it .
even though it appears
that life is not a constant struggle for survival ,
no-one wants to compose poetry or write novel
and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school system going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction
that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy.5 .
kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery
if she was so young
when the cataclysm of stupidity set in -- but any of it **hardly** qualifies her father for deification ! !
kashakim 's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his person from existence .
killed a bunch in the cataclysm 
stalled progress
( not a lot killed here ,
but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress )
until someone could take the crystal
to kill everybody ,
if they were not boiled in lava first
because the giant robot were not there to protect them .
a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim 's likeness ,
when kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of great king of atlantis !
6. even though milo was the only one
who could read atlantian ,
rourke and other knew enough
to look through a book of gibberish
and find a page on a crystal
-- which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or `` phase of the sun '' diagram.7 .
if milo 's grandfather had told rourke about it ,
it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo 's reading it as part of the book .
ripping out the page
-- which was dog-eared in rourke 's hand ,
even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently --
only was there to tip off the viewer
that `` something was not quite right '' .
unless the word `` crystal '' would have set alarm off in milo 's head
that somebody would try to steal it ,
milo would have suspected nothing .
it is just thick-headed foreshadowing.8 .
the crew 's `` double-cross '' was not a character change .
we learned
that vinny 
sweet 
audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning .
however 
the `` change of heart '' falls flat .
it was a change ,
and needed to be better motivated .
hard to do with character
who were not given anything to begin with.9 .
niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome ,
instead of filling in the rest of the area
that we view the sequence from .
it is liquid ;
it will not flow over the protective dome
until it fills up all lower areas.10 .
the ending stink !
-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness .
with it is powersource restored ,
atlantis is no longer a weak power ,
needing coddling .
the giant robot guardian and the sky-cycle shooting blue lightning suggest
that they have less to fear from us
than they might .
the technology is superior to ours 
and definitely to early 20th-century .
in the end milo needs to teach the atlantian to read 
for what ?
the whole idea is to leave their little quiet 
chastened culture alone ,
not to send it into hyperdrive .
** end spoiler **perhap 
the lost world plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint
that this is more an homage to pulps .
the failure i find with the film agree with this idea .
but i am at a loss
why i should pay to see thin character and plot hole
simply
because many dime novel had them as well .
and pulp story is part of the `` crap
they can not sell adult anymore '' 
anyway .
we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs
to grow up as well .
raider of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel
and avoided so much badness.4/10
-- the movie is enjoyable
but as i think about the plot ,
it seeps ever lower .
