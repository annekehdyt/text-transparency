i will tell you what happened ,
some person with money thought
it would be nice to ruin one of the best show
that was on tv .
did we really need a big screen re-make ?
did they ask the fan ?
i wonder
how all the fan would feel
if they did a remake of `` rocky horror picture show '' with actor like ashton krutcher 
steve martin 
britney spear 
and kiefer southerland ,
took out all the music ,
and made it a drama .
do you think
they would like that !
this movie does not have the same feel
to it
that the original had .
sure the original was a bit corny at time ,
but bo and luke were always nice ,
they got into trouble
because they were always set up
to get into trouble ,
and their main objective was to help person
that passed through town .
none of that mattered to the person
that made this film ,
they might have never even seen the original show all the way through .
my big question is ,
what will they ruin next ?
