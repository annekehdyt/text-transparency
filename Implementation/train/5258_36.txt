you do realize
that you have been watching the exact same show for eight year 
right ?
i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing stranger co-exist on an island ,
but you would think
that
after watching unkempt 
stink-ladened hero run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough
to get you to commit to something a little more original
( and interesting ) .and i am not even speaking of the show validity
which for the record i find questionable .
it is just hard to suspend disbelief for `` bushy bill '' eating a rat
when the entire crew of producer and camera person are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno 's with moxy.what is the appeal here ?
i do not care about these person or their meandering life .
i just do not get it .
but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy 
unwashed person ,
i suggest
you turn off your tv
and just take a trip
to your local bus station
where you can see person like this in their true habitat .
they call them homeless person ,
and free of charge ,
you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability
to retrieve various cigarette deis from a plethora of garbage canister ,
eventually striking `` pay-dirt '' and fashioning a homemade dr. frankenstein-styled cancer-stick ,
all the while begging person for change for food
when the stink of `` aqua velva '' on their eath is enough to suggest otherwise .
and the best part ?
much like survivor 
every week one member of the tribe `` leaf '' the `` island ''
when they are unceremoniously
sent packing to the local institution
when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kick into gear !
now that is entertainment !
