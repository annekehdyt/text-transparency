this movie should be nominated for a new genre :
complete mess !
except for a few chuckle and one or two scene of gore ,
this movie is a complete waste of time .
calling it `` campy '' does not even cut it .
`` campy '' imply fun
which this movie was not .
you spend the first half of the movie
thinking `` its got to get better 
right ? `` .
in fairness 
it does 
at the very end
when its finally explained
who the `` other/sister '' team are
and what they want but by then ,
you hardly care anymore
because you have spend the entire second half of the movie wondering
exactly what did mr. onorati and ms. pacula do to tick someone off this badly
to be stuck in such a horrible movie .
