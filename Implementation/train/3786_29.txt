the fourth in the `` dirty harry '' series 
this film features one of the most despicable 
ugliest 
unlikable 
profane 
disgusting female i have ever seen on film :
`` ray perkin 
''
played by audrie neenan .
she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 `` detour '' character 
`` ann savage .
`` her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off
so much i never watched this film again
until i acquired a profanity filter
which shut her up ... .and least some of her !
then i could enjoy the rest of the movie.everywhere `` harry callahan ''
( clint eastwood )
goes 
violence immediately follows ... ..within minute !
it happens
so often it is almost laughable
but it makes for a fast-moving ,
entertaining film with a satisfying ending
as all the scumbag villain are eliminated one-by-one.this
is a very sophomoric film
that appeal to our base instinct ... ..and connect ,
sad to say .
most of us like to see these dirtball get it in the end ,
and who does it better than dirty harry ?
