before starting to watch the show ,
i have heard
it was great and aesthetically very interesting .
what a deception 
the script are so dumb
that i am quite sure
the author are son and grandson of scoobidoo writer .
and what about the sfx and color ,
they are so extreme
that it is painful to watch ,
color are not saturated they are over saturated ,
like script are overwritten
and show is overrated .
this show is like a bad pie
in which a child would have put only sugar
and butter thinking
that
because these ingredient are the best ,
they are sufficient .
unfortunately for this show 
the only two ingredient of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility .
