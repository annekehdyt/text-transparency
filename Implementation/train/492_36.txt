dick tracy is one of my all time favorite film .
i must admit to those
that have not seen it .
you will either really love it or really hate it .
it came out a year after the success of batman .
so everyone 's expectation were so high
that many were let down simply
because the plot is so simple .
but its based on a comic strip ...
what did you expect ?
creatively 
this movie is amazing !
the set 
make-up 
music 
costume 
and the impressive acting make this film fantastic .
the film has bloodless violence and no bad language
-
that is something rare these day .
directed 
produced 
and star warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino 's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thug .
madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney .
this is one of the best character
madonna has ever played .
she has the best one liner i have heard !
madonna fan would love it !
one of the coolest thing about the film is that they only used seven color
to make it look like a comic strip .
this film is truly a piece of artwork
that is sadly overlooked by the public .
to sum thing up 
this film ings out the child in all of us .
it is a film
that will leave you smiling at the end .
