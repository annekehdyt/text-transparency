honetly ,
who in god 's name
gave this movie an 8.1 rating ? ?
i guess the person
who actually made or starred in the movie
were the one
who voted .
otherwise this movie sucks !
this movie is nothing more than an amateur 
or possibly student 
film .
i am a movie fanatic ,
and have seen terrible movie ,
but there was literally nothing redeeming here .
the story and acting was the worst i
have ever seen .
the prop ,
including the use of toy airsoft gun with terrible special effect ,
where just as bad as everything else .
i am all for bad language
in movie ,
but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word
and i think
we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any movie ever .
the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video camera and not actual film .
i would expect this to get award for an amateur movie
shown only on public access station around the country ,
but it does not belong on a dvd.do not buy this movie .
do not rent this movie .
all i can say
was
that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon .
this is valuable time
that you will never get back .
unfortunately for me ,
that time is lost ,
but it is not too late for you .
if you decide to rent this movie ,
consider this my warning .
