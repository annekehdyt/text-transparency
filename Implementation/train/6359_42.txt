i used to write comment at imdb ,
but i do not do so anymore .
it happens
that imdb has become massive ,
and consequently subjectiveness has ruined score .
what do i mean ?
that anyone
that is not particularly fond of movie
and does not have any expertise on the subject ,
watches some crap
( or the opposite ) ,
and in case he likes it 
delivers a 10 ,
and if
he does not he goes for a 1. this of course ,
can not measure anything correctly .
now for the film .
i truly regret ever
having delivered any 10s to some very few film ,
because then i must score this one with 12 or 13 ,
which is not possible .
this documentary has something
that i do not expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film .
it is simply mesmerizing ,
and it is not just a way of saying ;
it really is .
the last 25 minute have a load of energy 
visual rejoice and wisdom -the word
spoken by the starring guys- ,
that really ...
there is no possible match .
i do not keep movie ,
rarely would i find any sense
in doing so ,
but this one is the kind of film
you should buy
and keep 
and watch from time to time 
maybe 10 or 20 time as year go by .
i got nothing more to say .
this is a genuine 
objective 10 for me .
