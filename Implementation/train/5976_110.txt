this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre ,
which is my favorite genre of them all ,
so
when i saw
it was free on demand ,
i had to watch it !
it stars caroline munro 
from both dr. phibes film
( she was his wife
that died !
) 
dracula a.d. 1972 
the golden voyage of sinbad 
captain kronos - vampire hunter 
the spy
who loved me 
maniac ,
and faceless.brought to you by the person
behind do not open til christmas and piece ,
here my thought on this ...
it opens on april fool day ,
where a bunch of kid play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower ,
and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet
( all while hes naked ! ) .
the coach puts a stop to it ,
but both party swear revenge .
but 
the cool kid end up burning the nerd alive.cut to the future 
and its th high school reunion 
or so
they think
( bwahahha ? ) .
the only one with invitation were the gang
who burned the kid ,
and its april fool day
( or really 
the day before april fool ,
but the fun starts at midnight ) ,
yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall .
then they finally eak into the school
and it starts storming.inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them 
each of their locker and belonging 
along with marty 's
( the nerd ) locker and yearbook .
they also find the old black janitor/caretaker
who spends his time saying `` oooh yesser !
yesser !
i do not want no trouble 
sir ! ''
and then is killed instantly .
pretty pointless character 
but hes still my favorite.the movie takes a page out of alien 's book 
in a deliciously gory way
that you just have to see !
that when everyone realizes
that they are there to die ,
and they start freaking out 
except for shirley ,
who decides it would be best
to take a bath in the old school shower at a time like this .
of course 
it pours out blood and acid
and her face melt off
( very cool ,
mind you )
the rest of the night goes as usual 
sex 
drug ,
and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask.. whats their plan ?
`` all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon .
marty wont kill us during mid-day ! `` .
seriously ,
that what he said .
apparently you can only kill at nighttime .
but will they survive through the night ?
who will live and who will die ?
and why are all the body disappearing ?
rent 
buy 
or steal this great movie
to find out !
the movie is actually very good ,
filled with clich\u00e9s
( car wont start 
dammit ! )
and just plain slasher fun .
not to mention they all have name like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan .
i recommend it to all of you !
and 
not to mention ,
it has a spin off !
1989 's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem ,
and
that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell.favorite scene :
2 person
having sex ,
the guy wants to finish
but the girl does not .
`` talk dirty to me 
frank ! ! ''
she screams `` uh ...
tit ! ''
`` dirtier ! ''
`` uh ... tit .
f*ck .
tit .
boobs .
f*ck . `` .
it seems to work for her and at her climax 
the killer electrocutes them both !
