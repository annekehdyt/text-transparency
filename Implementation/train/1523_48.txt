not sure
if it was right or wrong ,
but i read thru the other comment
before watching the short.i have to say i disagree with most of the negative comment or problem person have had with it.as a first time `` lone wolf '' director/producer 
i like to see thing
that i can aspire to ,
not necessarily from the pro 's ,
but by person
just getting their foot wet like me.if indeed this is also from a first-timer 
as i read 
i applaud the effort.marvelous job then in that respect !
there were some comment about the music.i thought
it was quite nice for the piece.some say
it kind of droned along for a while ,
but i found
that created tension
without ( us )
necessarily being conscious of it ,
and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chord ,
it was like we knew
there was a train on the track ,
but realize
it is just now moving .
yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there ,
but shi* happens.did anyone else see hugh 's dirty shirt turn white
( near the end 
in the rain )
in `` australia '' ?
look how much money and person were behind that movie !
give the kid a eak for god sake !
all in all i think
it was very well done .
only 2 thing i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-do not walk up to a shiny ass picture frame with the camera ,
and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shot to a still shot ,
so person would not necessarily know what it is.my experience so far has taught me
that it is not that it is hard
to make a movie ,
it just takes time
to learn how to do it ,
then the time to actually do it ,
and then you better take some more time still to think of all the detail you will need to have shot
before you call `` post-production time ! ''
imho 
it looks like director/writer ryan jafri did his homework ,
and
if this indeed is his first report card ,
i would give him an `` a '' .
the rest of you report to the principal office for a whuppin ' .
