have not watched kid film for some year ,
so i missed `` here come the tiger ''
when it first came out .
( never even saw `` bad news bear ''
even though in the '70s i worked for the guy
who arranged financing for that movie 
`` warrior 
'' `` man
who would be king 
''
and `` rocky horror picture show 
'' among other . )
now i like to check out old or small movie and find person
who have gone on to great career
despite
being in a less than great movie early on .
just minute into this movie i could take no more
and jumped to the end credit
to see
if there was a young actor in this movie
who had gone on to bigger and better thing
-- at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot
and acting were not doing the job .
lo and behold 
i spied wes craven 's name in the credit as an electrical gaffer .
he had already made two or three of his early shocker
but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the `` scream '' movie .
maybe he owed a favor
and helped out on this pic .
more surprising was fred j. lincoln in the cast credit as `` aesop 
'' a wacky character in the movie .
f.j. lincoln 
from the '70s
to just a few year ago ,
appeared in and produced adult film .
he was associated with the adult spoof `` the ozporn 
''
and just that title is funnier than all of `` tiger '' attempt at humor combined .
let the fact
that an adult actor was placed in a kid movie
be an indication
as to how the person
making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel .
