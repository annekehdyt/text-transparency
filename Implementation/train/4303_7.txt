this is the touching story of two family in israel and the relationship within each family .
each family has a gay son .
the story are interrelated at that point
but this film is about all of the family member ,
not just the two son .
the portrait of each of the family member in both family are well drawn
and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak .
