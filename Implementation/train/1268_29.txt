we expected something great
when we went to see this bomb .
it is basically a broadway play put on film .
the music is plain terrible .
there is not one memorable song in the movie
-- heard any hit from this movie ?
you will not because there are not any .
some of the musical number go on so long
that i got up to go to the restroom
and get some pop corn
and it was still going
when i got back !
if they were good song well
-- but they suck .
the pace is slow 
terrible character development .
the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song
-- it was almost impossible to stand .
this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die-hard broadway enthusiast .
this is without a doubt
the most over rated movie i have seen in my entire life .
a complete waist of time and money .
there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover
-- who was not on screen enough
and whose character was not developed enough .
rent the video and you will agree
-- this movie was an expensive 
over produced 
polished dog do .
