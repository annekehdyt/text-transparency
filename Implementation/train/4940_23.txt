this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing
that million scraped together 10 cent
to see it
and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic condition during the 30 's .
remember 
10 cent bought a loaf of ead back then ,
so this was a minor luxury for many person .
it is testimony to how hollywood did its best
to make the usa
feel a little better about itself .
you will note
that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actor and actress were type-cast in similar movie 
e.g .
jame cagney 
william powell 
ruby keeler 
frank mchugh 
joan blondell and guy kibbee .
then too 
anch of the u.s. military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision
marching by the great choreographer 
busby berkeley 
at the end .
