husband beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom .
the film 's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great .
the stooge are always funny
when they cook .
however after the first few minute of cooking footage 
we cut to original footage of brideless groom .
one thing i noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remake are
that they do fit with the new story .
they do an insert shot
if the old story line does not match.husband beware does have a new ending ,
but i will not give it away to those
who want to be surprised .
**** out of 4 star .
