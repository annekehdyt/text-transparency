when carol
( vanessa hidalgo )
starts looking into her other 's death ,
she begins to suspect something more sinister than `` natural cause '' .
the closer
she gets to the truth ,
the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law 
fiona
( helga line ) ,
and the rest of the local satanist .
they will do whatever is necessary
to put a stop her nosy ways.if
you are into sleazy 
satanic-themed movie ,
black candle has a lot to offer .
the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex .
one scene in particular
involving a young woman and a goat must
be seen to be believed .
unfortunately 
all the sleaze in the world can not save black candle .
most of the movie is a total bore .
other than the one scene i have already mentioned ,
the numerous sex scene are not shocking
and certainly are not sexy .
the acting is spotty at best .
even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance .
the plot really does not matter .
its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scene together .
i am only familiar with one other movie
directed by jose ramon larraz .
compared with his daughter of darkness
that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror 
black candle comes off as amateurish .
3/10 is about the best i can do .
