r o b o t j o x.burn the master.grotesquely horrible.no ending ;
no closure.completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.replaces `` the adventure of pluto nash ''
as the worst movie of all time.i hate this utterly unacted 
unedited 
unscripted 
undirected 
unproduced mess of a thing
called `` robot jox '' - and i
just found out -
they made a second one ! ? ! ?
i apologize to adma sandler
( zohar the beauticin )
and eddie murphy
( pluto nash )
for hating their movie .
this mess of a thing makes
those movie only bad -
not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing .
this is the only movie
for which i have ever said
this - remove it from netflix - now ! ! !
