master cin\u00e9aste alain resnais like to work with those actor
who are a part of his family.in this film too we see resnais ' family member like pierre arditi 
sabine azema 
andr\u00e9 dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious theme like death 
religion 
suicide 
love and their overall implication on our daily life.the formal nature of relationship
shared by these person
is evident as even friend ,
they address each other
using a formal you.in 1984 ,
while making l'amour \u00e0 mort ,
resnais dealt with time ,
memory and space
to unravel the mystery of a fundamental question of human existence :
is love stronger than death ?
it was 16 year ago in 1968
that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime
which was also about love and memories.message of this film
is loud and clear :
true and deep love can even put science to shame
as dead lover regain their lost life
leaving doctor to care for their reputation.l'amour \u00e0 mort is like a game
which is not at all didactic.it is a film
in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reason
why this film can easily be grasped .
