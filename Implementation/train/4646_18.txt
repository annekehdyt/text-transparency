it is just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project .
so refreshing and educating .
not only to a filmmaker ,
who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minute of screen time ,
but also as audience ,
who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.20 short film about love in paris are all unique 
but some of them ,
as expected ,
stand out .
i thought
the tom tykwer
( natalie portman )
segment was the best ,
although the mime made me smile inside just the same.i clicked on `` spoiler '' option for this review bus ala ...
what you read is a spoiler enough .
just watch it .
do not read what i write ,
but watch the movie instead.and smile .
