whatever you become in your life ,
you must never forget
that you have roots.this is the story of true fact
that was made into a beautiful and moving movie !
i dare to say
that this movie is well underrated.this shows us a reality of life ...
the more evil surround you ,
the better person you become.trust in your instinct
and be aware
that the ideal of life is to live it happy ...
without grudge ,
without living `` under a rock '' .
the movie concept is more that interesting ... connecting the storytelling with real life event ...
keeping us aware of everything..from fact to emotion !
bless these person
and make everyone happy !
see it ,
i recommend it to all young person.it is not about racism
it is about how to live your life !
