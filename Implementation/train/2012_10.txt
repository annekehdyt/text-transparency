i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending
even though i felt so angry at what i saw .
i felt
that the director was screaming for attention and the only way
he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible .
since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young person in the worst way imaginable .
there is nothing to be said
but avoid it ,
it will make you angry and sick .
the person involved should be ashamed .
