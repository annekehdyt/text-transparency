i actually retired from asian horror film some time ago
after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish .
however 
i have been getting more and more into exploitation flick recently ,
and so decided to give them another chance .
my first port of call was highly rated director takashi miike 's highly rated 'visitor q ' .
i would already seen audition ,
and
while i did not like it much ,
i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror film .
so 
i went into this with sensible expectation ;
and unfortunately 
found only boredom .
i suppose this movie is actually really clever
and it just went over my head ,
but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scene with little or no coherency between them .
any comparison to the work of luis bunuel and david lynch is blasphemous as far as i am concerned ;
all miike has done here
is make a film ;
any intelligence
surrounding
it has been implemented by pretentious fan ,
desperate to find some kind of meaning .
my headache set in about 10 minute
in ( after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason ) ,
and it did not subside until the movie finally ended ;
at least twenty four hour later 
or so it would seem .
do not get me wrong ,
i am not against violence in movie
and in fact actively seek out the most notorious film around ;
but
while this may be violent ,
it is also pointless and boring and i did not get one ounce of enjoyment out of it .
takashi miike may have a lot of fan ,
but i am certainly not one of them ;
and i certainly hope
this is the last time i will come into contact with one of his film .
