i think
this film has much to recommend it 
particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr. foxx .
although there are a lot of hole in the plot
and the motivation is very ,
very hard to follow in some case ,
all in all 
it makes for a nice time in front of the tube .
