this movie is just great .
if you have a chance to see it ,
then you should run to see it .
even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 ,
pacino does a great job
playing as tony montana
to get around .
pacino has this way
about him
where he can say anything in anyway
and make it sound just great .
if you thought
that pulp fiction was good with the swear word
(
if you saw it )
then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them .
( its quite sweet )
even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time ,
not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct ,
it is still easy to follow along ,
but you must keep your eye peeled at all time
to not lose anything .
personally 
i have found
that watching this movie makes three hour seem like a eeze ,
it is really just that great .
this movie is one of thoe movie
that is acted
and directed so well
that not only do you forget
that this movie was made in the crappy 80s
but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy ...
`` so say good night to the bad guy ''
