brilliant !
my wife and i joined the sprawling line
to see holly at the edinburgh film festival .
after seeing the film ,
i can understand
why there was such a long line .
holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two person .
she is a young girl ,
he is a worn out westerner .
the film grasped every bone in our body .
there are not any graphic scene or anything
that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality
that really kicks you in the gut .
the film is beautifully shot .
among other 
we loved the scene
where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle .
thuy ngoyen 's rawness
( can not believe
this is her first acting job )
and ron livingston 's performance stayed with me for a couple of day .
highly recommended .
