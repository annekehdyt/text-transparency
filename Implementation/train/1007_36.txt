there have been a lot of zorro film made over the decade ,
but it is a shame
that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.zorro 's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro film .
first off 
it is a republic serial in 12 chapter .
and this time 
zorro is not played by a top studio star like dougla fairbank 
tyrone power or antonio bandera
but instead by workman-like actor reed hadley .
while hadley does not cast
as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other ,
he does an adequate job ,
helped by the fact
that he is not the sole hero here ;
as the title imply 
he has a fighting legion to call upon.another big difference is that the setting is not california .
the story here take place in central mexico in 1824
where a man
posing as a living god
incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaw
to aid him in his plan
to overthrow the newly established mexican republic .
something 
zorro 
and a handful of follower plan
to do anything
they can to stop.do
not get me wrong ,
there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode 
from corny `` twang '' bow sound effect to ludicrous acting .
but overall 
this represents one of the best republic serial of all time ,
and probably the best zorro one.the plot is stronger than most serial
and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering. ,
and there is lot of great action
- fan of the indiana jones movie will notice many bit borrowed from this serial .
