boring 
long 
pretentious 
repetitive 
self-involved \u0096 this move felt like a bad date .
worse 
the tedious art-school direction
-- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot
that gets so overdone
it almost made me throw up \u0096-
is constantly screaming to be noticed .
add the thinnest of plot and virtually no dialogue ,
and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minute in .
it gets worse :
instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-over and quote and song
that comment all too obviously on the character .
really loud opera music too .
blame
it all on the director.the actor are all quite good .
the lead actor miguel angel hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom .
he and the other actor have some tender erotic moment .
even these start to get boring after 5 minute however ,
and one wonder
if the director is auditioning for a bel ami porn job .
the stunning college campus architecture
as a location in mexico city is inspiring .
how come university in the us are so bland
( sfsu 
uc 
etc . ) ?
but wait for the dvd on this film .
you will want to use the fast scan button \u0096 a lot .
