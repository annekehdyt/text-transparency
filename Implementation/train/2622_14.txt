outrage is pretty good movie !
robert culp was very good in the movie
and was perfect for the part !
its hard to believe
that this is a true story
but what can you do ?
when i watched this i thought
why do they have to do all of those thing .
it is not right
but they learned their lesson
when they picked on the wrong man !
anyway
if you ever see this movie on tv watch
it because its a good one !
