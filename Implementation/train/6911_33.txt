please make me forget .
please .
please .
this is the worst film i
have ever had the misfortune to watch .
i consider the film an insult to my ain as well as my backside
who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film .
i have yet to see what damage
it has caused my sight and my ability
to complete sentence .
what a load of garbage ! !
and do not get me started about the acting ...
someone please help me forget ! !
`` weird science ''
-- come back ! !
everything is forgiven ...
i am `` proud ''
to give this film the first 1 here at imdb ...
and i have voted for hundred of film ... many of them c**p
but this is so bad i can not even believe it .
someone actually came up with the idea
and thought
it was worthy of becoming a film ?
someone actually read the script
and decided to produce the film ?
someone read the script and auditioned for it ?
someone saw the film
and decided *not* to put it on a shelf
to collect dust for eternity ?
*these* are the question i want answer to .
not the philosophical question
about that tree in the wood and well ,
you know ...
