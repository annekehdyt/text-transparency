i should put out an alert all over saying
that the movie should not be watched .
it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner
that it is almost an insult to the memory of those ave man .
the special effect were horrible ,
i had not expected the total failure on the part of the director
to appreciate military technology .
how can a machine gun
which normally fires at the rate of 600 round per minute fire at 1/10th the speed ?
how can soldiers fall forward
when a grenade explodes in front of them ?
how can person survive
when there are artillery shell falling as close as 20 foot away ?
how come the artillery shell fall only on either side of the road
and not the road itself ?
not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me ,
it was the cliched situation and the incongruity of the dialogue
which had me screaming murder .
there were the standard dialogue like ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai 
ise laath mat maro and pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to hindustaan me hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai .
stupid
to say
the least.what shobha de had written is true .
the director worked without a script
and it shows .
there is no flow to the movie .
there is no gradual progression from one battle to another .
it is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war .
the explanatory scene are awful .
the chief of army staff looks unconvincing .
to make matter
worse the theatre person had indiscriminately cut footage
to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hour .
