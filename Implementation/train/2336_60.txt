`mad dog ' earle is back 
along with his sad-sack moll marie 
and that fickle clubfoot velma .
so are babe and red 
doc and big mac 
and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard .
the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh 's high sierra 14 year later
without rethinking a line or a frame ,
and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original .
( instead of walsh we get stuart heisler 
for humphrey bogart we get jack palance 
for ida lupino shelley winter ,
and so on down through the credit . )
the only change is that 
this time 
instead of black-and-white ,
it is in warnercolor ; sadly ,
there are those
who would count this an improvement.i died
a thousand time
may be unnecessary \u0096 and inferior \u0096 but at least it is not a travesty ;
the story still works on its own stagy term .
earle
( palance ) ,
fresh out of the pen near chicago ,
drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney ,
jr. \u0096
knocking over a post mountain resort .
en route 
he almost collides with a family of oaky ,
when he is smitten with their granddaughter ;
the smiting holds
even when he discovers
she is lame .
arriving at the cabin
where the rest of gang hole up ,
he finds amateurish hothead at one another 's throat as well as winter ,
who throws herself at him
( as does the pooch ) .
biding time
until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel 
palance
( to winter 's chagrin )
offers to pay for an operation
to cure the girl 's deformity 
a gesture
that backfires .
then 
the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath .
on the lam 
palance move higher into the cold sierras ...
.it is an absorbing enough story 
competently executed ,
that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast ought to it in 1941 ,
the year bogie 
with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon 
became a star .
and one last 
heretical note :
those mountain do look gorgeous in color .
