this film is one
that played very well back in 1932
and probably would not work as well today
because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived .
however ,
if you are the sort person ,
like me ,
who adores older hollywood film ,
you cut the film a bit of slack
and can enjoy it for what it is
-- an interesting soap.the film is set in a ward for problem pregnancy .
in this large room are about a half dozen bed
in which woman are waiting to give birth
-- but doctor are concerned about possible complication
( yike --
such a room would really traumatize the mother ! ) .
and 
like an episode of `` love boat '' or `` fantasy island '' ,
each mother has her own special story .
with so many rather extreme and crazy story ,
you have to suspend disbelief .
i could
and enjoyed the film
quite a bit.here are a few of the story :
one involves a father .
you do not see the mom ,
but he is a very 
very nervous father
and it is included for comic relief .
however 
he was wonderful here
-- very touching.loretta young and eric linden are a sad case .
loretta is sent to the hospital from prison
-- she apparently killed some horrible guy .
you do not know exactly what occurred ,
but you assume he was trying to force himself on her !
yet 
she was given a 20 year sentence
-- and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much
as he can.glenda farrell is an awful person .
she has the maternal instinct of a hamster
-- a really 
really bad and alcoholic hamster !
she is pretty funny
and worth seeing through most of the film .
i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle
filled with gin as well as becoming upset
when she learns she can not make money selling her twin ! !
late in the film 
she has a typical hollywood-style change of heart
that was supposed to be touching
-- i found
it contrived.there is a woman
who has given birth to a still-born baby .
amazingly 
afterword 
they put the lady back in the same ward as the woman waiting
to give birth ! ! !
a crazy woman ,
who you assumed lost a baby some time ago ,
wander down from the psychiatric unit .
she insists
she is having a baby .
later 
she escapes again
and actually takes one of the kid !
there are most story than this
but the one i mentioned are the main one .
as i said ,
it is a soap opera of sort
and is highly entertaining
-- and quite sad in the case of several of the story .
the ending 
in particular 
is heart-eaking and exceptionally well done .
there were a few particularly good performance
-- especially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse .
all in all 
a very good film
-- and i have no idea
why they felt
they had to remake the film just a few year later
( which was typical for warner brother ) .
