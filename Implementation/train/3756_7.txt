protocol is an implausible movie
whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actor .
the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress
who becomes famous
after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary .
the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie 's charm just does not save this movie .
unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film .
