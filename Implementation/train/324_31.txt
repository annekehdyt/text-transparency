i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie ,
and also the caliber of the bullet
that he was suppose to be firing .
if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock 's sniping ,
i am guessing
that it is a 7mm .
round .
i am also curious of the rifle itself .
he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle
that the vietnamese man let him use
that belonged to his father .
beckett mentioned
that he thought
it was the best sniper rifle ever made .
i would like to know
which rifle that is also .
i know
that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand .
i just could not get a close enough look
at it watching the movie
to identify it.as for mr. hathcock kill ,
his longest shot was 1.47 mile ,
and he had 93 confirmed kill and 14 unconfirmed kill .
after his wound somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam ,
he spent the rest of his career teaching sniper in the usmc the skill
that they would need in the field .
his sniping career is still mentioned to our other and sister
that train in the usmc .
i found out his name from my friend
who is a former marine .
any information would be great .
