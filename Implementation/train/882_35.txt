an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly .
watch as gene sing 
act and dance his way through paris in any number of situation .
some purely majestic 
other pure corn .
one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before `` singin ' in the rain '' .
he is definately one of the all time great .
it is interesting to look at the parallel between the two film 
especially in kelly 's character ,
the only main difference being
that one is based in paris ,
the other in l.a.some have said
that leslie caron 's acting was less than pure .
perhaps cyd charisse ,
who was originally intended for the role
could have done better ,
however caron is quite believable in the role
and has chemistry with kelly .
oscar levant 's short role in this film gave it just what it needed ,
someone
who does not look like gene kelly .
filling the role
as the everyman is not an easy task ,
yet levant did it with as much class
as any other lead.the song and dance routine are all perfection .
even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without .
seeing that there really was not much screen time
to make such a loving relationship believable 
minnelli used this sequence
to make it seem
as if you would spent four hour with them .
ingenious ! i would have to rate this film up with singin '
since it is very similar in story and song .
singin ' would barely get the nod
because of debbie reynold uplifting performance.full recommendation.8/10 star .
