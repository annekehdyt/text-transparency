i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i ,
too found mary poppin
( although i love julie andrew and dick vandyke )
to be silly and sacrine-sweet .
angela lansbury plays her character to perfection
and i do not know
why person
think of this film as distorted .
it was magical
and it was lot of fun to watch .
every scene held a certain charm
as you got to know the character better .
you truly see how this little thrown together family learn
to bond with each other ,
despite their age and difference .
i thought
the character were well developed 
especially charle
who was at `` the age of not believing '' .
mary poppin may be more popular and cherished by other
but this little gem will be the one
that i will always love and cherish .
