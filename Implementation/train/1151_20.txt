`` godzilla vs king ghidorah '' is a perfect example
how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topic like pseudo-patriotism .
here 
traveller from the future try to ruin japan ,
replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster 
the three-headed golden dragon king ghidorah .
they fail 
however and in the end godzilla fight ghidorah .
the battle between the two behemoth are very cool ,
but the plot of the movie is full with hole and the all thing
about `` japan is great ''
is really stupid .
the creator of this movie did not even threat with respect the enemy of japan ,
making them stupid big blond guy ,
who are easily outsmarted by the clever japanese .
the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king ghidorah nearly destroyed the both japan
and it is ridiculous enemy in one
( actually two ) spectacular combat .
but till this battle royale 
the film was really dull and pathetic .
