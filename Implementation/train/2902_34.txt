this adaptation of pearl s. buck 's film is certainly a classic .
a true hollywood epic 
it has all the thing a great hollywood film has :
birth 
death 
happiness 
sadness 
exhilaration 
despair 
and so on .
there is only one thing
that irks me .
i know
it was a sign of the time ,
but neither of the two main character are played by asian actor .
paul muni was a great actor ,
and he does an admirable job as wang lung 
the owner of a farm in china .
luise rainier plays olan .
she does not even look chinese !
i think
she tried to get the role ,
but they should have put anna may wong in the role .
i know
why they did not ,
and ms. rainier is very good in the film ,
but they hardly tried to make her look `` authentic '' .
stillm its a great film ,
especially if you read the book
( i did in high school 
decade ago ) .
its a must see 
just look beyond the casting .
i think you can .
