`` how to lose friend and alienate person ''
is not based on tiger wood ' infidelity .
it is a mediocre romantic comedy
based on toby young 's book on his experience
working as a journalist covering celeity .
the film star simon pegg as sidney young 
a zany british journalist
who takes a job in an illustrious celeity magazine in new york .
young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigan to alienate all around him 
hence movie title .
he is uproarious 
daring 
and moronic .
but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason 
he is a somewhat likable character .
sidney befriend a fellow journalist 
the composed alison olsen 
played quite admirably by kirsten dunst .
however 
sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes
played by the fantastic ms. megan fox .
this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on `` eye candy '' material .
sidney gets in all kind of tomfoolery
in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. those are the peak comedic moment of the film .
however 
i think
that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewer and alienated authentic rom-com material
by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney and alison ;
even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise .
pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young .
jeff bridge was again building `` the dude '' idge with his enigmatic
supporting work as clayton harding 
the magazine 's suave prez .
but the rest of the film 's acting was not worthy enough to feature here .
`` how to lose friend and alienate person ''
should not be alienated entirely ,
but you might lose some movie friend
if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy .
