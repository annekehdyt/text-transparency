this movie had good intention and a good story
to work with .
the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull 
boring filmstrip
that made me feel
like i was back in mr. hartford 's 8th grade social study class
-- way back in 67.what a waste ,
will somebody please take this story
and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.every time a scene had potential ,
all we were left with were a few clich\u00e9s ,
combined with black and white footage
that they probably got from the history channel
to show the action .
shameful.ossie davis was the only ight light in this dull fest .
the other acting was incredibly dull -
it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery.however ,
if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaw in this movie
and are not concerned with being awed or entertained ,
but want to learn about the uss mason ,
it is worth a watch .
