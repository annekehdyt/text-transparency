this movie `` joshua '' is extremely disturbing 
and downright pointless .
it actually makes me shudder to think there are person
who would enjoy watching it .
without giving away the story
it is about a young boy 's reaction to his newborn sister ,
and that is just the tip of the iceberg .
during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable .
adding insult to injury ,
by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome
except the fruition of pure evil at the hand of a child no less ,
who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adult .
there is no redemption 
no justice served ,
and a whole group of adult who are not smart enough
to see what is going on around them .
frankly 
i did not enjoy watching this movie .
it was extremely unsettling .
even for those
who might enjoy horror movie ,
this movie could be too much .
despite the fact
this movie was well acted ,
the story itself is so disturbing
that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist 's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure .
