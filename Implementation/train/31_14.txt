i have not laughed that much in a long time -
although the movie has some sad moment too ,
especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious .
the character are very realistic most of the time 
sappy sometime 
but quite believable .
i am not a fan of the jerry springer show - i feel sorry for the participating person .
this film instead is a satire ,
and it is doing great.too bad
that all expletive were *beeped* out
while this movie aired on public tv ,
that takes a lot of fun out of it .
i will go rent this movie
to fully enjoy it .
