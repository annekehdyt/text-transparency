the king maker is a film about a series of real
( citation needed )
event
that occurred during the portuguese occupation in indochina.although the costume and art direction
are commendable ,
the movie still fails to impress the viewer .
the acting 
in particular 
was extremely poor .
some of the actor are trying hard to let tear down and the accent 
both real and fake 
are extremely irritating .
the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid
to be true
and it seemed more like a history lesson .
the movie could not even capture that sort of regal and century-old air
and it looked more like a botched attempt
to make an asian version of elizabeth.final say ?
costume and art direction give the film a eath of fresh air ,
but the execution was extremely poor
and the actor could not even give natural burst of emotion .
in short 
the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script .
