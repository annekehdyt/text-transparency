i loved the first two movie ,
but this movie was just a waste of time and money
( for me and the studio ) .
i am still wondering
why they made this horrible movie .
the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car ,
that can go into another house
are ridiculous .
joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movie were so funny ,
but the terrorist in this one are so stupid and not funny .
believe
me this movie is just a waste of time .
