i am gon na tip the scale here a bit
and say
i enjoyed this .
however 
the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those
who have very absurdist tendency .
it is definitely something
that most person will not get ,
as is the nature of absurdism.the animation
is horrible 
but yes ,
that is the point .
the main character is foul mouthed 
violent 
and stupid .
no redeeming quality whatsoever .
his wife shrieks and wail 
apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skill .
most of these story completely lack any kind of point.but again ,
that is the point ; )
if non sequiter 
foul language 
and complete and utter randomness are your thing ,
you are going to love this.it is really short ,
so i would probably rent instead of buying .
