phantasm ... .class .
phantasm ii ... ..awesome .
phantasm iii ... ..erm ... ..terrible.even
though i would love to stick up for this film ,
i quite simply can not .
the movie seems to have `` sold out '' .
first bad sign come
when the video has trailer for other film at the start
( something the other did not ) .
also too many pointless character 
prime examples the kid
( who is a crack shot ,
funny initially
but soon you want him dead ) ,
the woman
who uses karate
to fight off the ball
( erm not gon na work 
or rather should not )
and the blooming zombie
( what the hell are they doing there ,
there no link to them in the other phatasms ) .
also there is a severe lack of midget running about.the
only good bit are the cracking start and 
of course 
reggie b .
( possible spoiler coming up )
to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra character just leave at the end
so can continue with main 4 in iv.overall very 
very disappointing .
