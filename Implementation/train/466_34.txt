we start all of our review with the following information .
my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movie per year for the past 15 year .
recently 
we were honored by receiving lifetime movie pass to any movie any time at no cost !
so we can see whatever
we want whenever we want .
the point of this is that critic count for zero .
your local critic or the national critic like ebert are really no different
than you or me .
the only difference is that they get to write about the movie
and are forced to see hundred of movie
whether they want to or not.therefore ,
it is our belief
that
if you get your money worth for two hour of enjoyment
that is good enough for us !
we never ever listen or read the critic .
we only care about our friend and those
who we know
like the same thing as us .
well enough about that.this movie is very good .
not just good but very good .
the critic are a bunch of moron .
just
because there is nudity and language
they hated it .
it was worth the price of ticket
and that is all you can ask for .
is that not right ?
every movie can not be an academy award nominee .
sharon stone is gorgeous
and does a great job in the movie
and it mystifies me as to what in the hell
the critic want
