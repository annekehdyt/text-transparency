the first two-third of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting .
betty ,
as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol ,
comes across as a pleasant 
girl-next-door type ,
who saw nothing wrong with what she did
( and there certainly was not anything `` wrong '' with it ) .
director mary harron ,
who also made `` i shot andy warhol '' and `` american psycho '' 
recreates betty 's america
by mixing old black and white stock footage with new 
degraded 
black and white footage .
once betty land in florida
and starts working with bunny yeager ,
color is introduced .
betty 's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw
( lili taylor 
in a great performance 
and chris bauer ) ,
as well as john willie
( jared harris ) .
the scene
where harron recreates betty 's bondage photography session are fascinating and adroitly executed .
the early purveyor of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly
and we get a sense
that these folk were part of a tight `` community '' .
betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety ,
although we get the impression
that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world .
because the film 's third act is virtually non-existent ,
we are left with the impression
that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama .
flaw aside 
it is a film well worth catching
and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon .
