seven pound star will smith as ben thomas 
an irs collection agent
who has an ulterior motive for meeting those
who have gotten behind on their tax payment .
thomas caused the death of seven person whilst driving
talking on his phone
and the movie follows his attempt
to try and atone for his 
quite frankly 
unforgivable crime.the story line is as subtle as a ick through a green house window .
what you see is exactly
what is happening -
even the ending of titanic was more surprising
when compared to seven pound .
there is absolutely no twist whatsoever ,
there is never any confusion or doubt
as to what is happening.normally i only like will smith
when is in full bad boy mode .
the guy is at his best
when sporting a gun 
driving a ford gt
and saying `` aw hell nah ''
as whenever he tries to act serious
it only comes across as a pathetic attempt
at trying to gain an oscar
which he is so obviously
is desperate for .
this is probably the main reason
why i was not looking forward to the movie ,
although here he is very understated .
there are flash of comedy
but they are subtle ,
in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen
and for that reason
alone he was fantastic
and ironically should be nominated for a major award.the
supporting cast were all grand too -
rosario dawson looked pretty much at death door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine
as where all the other bit players.overall it is a weepy -
but it is not throwing all the usual clich\u00e9s and sentimental violin
to give you no other choice but to cry .
there were a few time
that even my hardened heart nearly oke .
you will be hard pressed
not to find one of the situation
that does not relate to your own life
which makes it seem all the more real.i would give it 8/10 .
the will smith show move onto drama
without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness
and comes of all the better for it .
