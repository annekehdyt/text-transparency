just had to write that one liner ,
but it really is .
i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry
i have seen in recent year .
i have praise for everyone involved in most aspect except the most important one 
the script .
it is a weak story about a petty criminal .
no amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance .
i love kevin spacey and i hear
he is gon na do another film about the general .
my advice is do not waste your time .
