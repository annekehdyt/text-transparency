and i gave it a high 7 ... ..why ?
because it bloody well rocked .
at the time
when there were so many other show
on
that were tied to toys/games this show
was unique in that it had overlapping story .
as other have said
here it was ahead of its time .
sadly this is why
the show was doomed .
they have released 4 dvds with 16 episode of the series so far .
i am hoping
that more come out .
how does this compare watching it now 20 year
after it first came out.. i do not know
i still like it
despite the sometime clunky animation ,
and that imho is it is only flaw .
the writing was almost top notch
and way ahead of the competition ... ... .. i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episode in proper order ... the dvds are good
but i do not think
the story are in their proper order ,
but despite this the show rocked .
