i saw this movie once a long time ago ,
and i have no desire to ever see
it again.this movie is about preston water 
a hard-lucked preteen ,
who always seems to be overlooked by his family
and who always seems to be short on cash .
all this change
when a bank robber runs over preston 's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation .
preston uses the check
to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank
( ironically ,
the money belongs to the bank robber
who gave him the check ) .
preston then buys a mansion
and says
that he is working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr. macintosh
( named after his computer ) .
after that 
he just goes crazy with the money.on paper ,
this sounds like a great idea .
however 
on screen 
it is one of the emptiest movie i have ever seen .
for one thing 
it is too unbelievable .
i know
some part of the movie were meant to be incredible ,
but i draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman ,
and being put in charge of a imaginary person 's small fortune .
also 
this was a shallow movie with weak acting 
a predictable plot line and character
who are less than memorable .
the character were either cheesy 
over the top 
annoying 
or underdeveloped .
but `` juice '' was a funny character.if
you are looking for a good movie
to watch with your family 
skip this one .
