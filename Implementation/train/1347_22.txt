i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such ,
it is very impressive .
it has the feel
and pacing of a `` true indie '' ,
yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision 
command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional .
the shot are well framed
and thought out and serve to move the story forward .
he 
and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story
that has much more depth and lyricism than typical `` paint by number '' type script .
it is a story
that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent
to have a shot at working .
judd is fantastic as usual ;
as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd .
the real surprise though is elliot korte
who plays adam groden .
yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role
that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach .
anyway 
i found the film refreshing and entertaining .
