is this a stupid movie ?
you bet ! !
i could not find any moment in this film
that was creepy or scary .
stupid moment ?
plenty .
stupid character ?
you bet .
bad effect ?
everywhere !
rick baker may have gone
and done bigger and better thing ,
this is not one of them .
oh well person got ta start somewhere .
dr. ted nelson is cheesed .
he is the most whiny doctor
i have ever seen .
he is got a melting man running amok out in ventura county somewhere ,
he is not overly happy
that his wife is pregnant
( probably cause
she is 55 year old and weighs 90 lbs )
and there is no cracker to be found anywhere .
plus he is got the not-too-helpful general on his hinder wanting
to find astronaut steve .
and the local sheriff wants to know
what is going on even though mr. nelson can not tell him anything .
there also some random character thrown in for good measure
who encounter the melting man .
eventually the movie ends
and out monster gets scooped into a trash can to become compost .
in the end it is just what you need for a great mst episode .
