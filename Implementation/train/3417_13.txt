this movie was highly entertaining .
the soundtrack
( bian adam )
is simply beautiful and inspiring .
even more impressive is brian adam doing all the song in french as well .
the score is also uplifting
and dramatic.the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation ,
combined with computer generated image .
the result is truly stunning .
i watch this film at least once a week with my kid and we never tire of it .
the story is compelling
and well narrated.i do not understand anyone
who would rank this movie less than a 7. definately a keeper in my household .
