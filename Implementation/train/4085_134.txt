... though for a film
that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror ,
there was a distinct lack of blood.there
was also a distinct lack of skilled directing 
acting 
editing ,
and script-writing.jeremy london put in one of most appalling performance i have ever seen
- his `` descent into the maelstr\u00f6m '' of madness is achingly self-aware and clumsy .
oh look at him twitch !
oh look at him drink strong spirit !
oh look at him raise his ow 
and cock his head at a jaunty angle !
oh look at his unwashed 
greasy dark hair !
oh listen to his affectedly husky voice !
he must be a tortured artist/writer/genius !
oh 
yes 
out comes the poet-shirt -
it is another boy
who thinks
he is byron .
( or poe . )
oh for the love of ... did someone give this guy a manual on `` how to act good ''
or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere 
the defunct little plastic toy-prize in a discontinued and of bargain-bin cereal .
okay 
that was a stupid line -
but that is only because london 's performance has melted my ain with its awfulness.katherine heigl is cute 
and very iar rose ,
but has yet to grow into her acting shoe in this film -
she delivered her line like she was being held up 
in fact 
her whole performance was very wooden 
her pose as stiff as her line -
who knows ,
perhaps she was just reacting to ,
and trying to neutralise 
jeremy london 's flailing excess ,
but if that is the case ,
she takes it too far.notable
is arie verveen as poe -
while his character 's role is confused ,
he delivers the best performance of the piece .
he 
quite simply 
looks right ,
but it is more than that -
he has some sort of depth ,
i believed
that he had a life beyond the dismal two-dimensional quality of the rest of the character .
huh 
maybe it is just because i like poe ,
and could thus just let my mind wander and invent
while he was on screen - whatever ,
he had an interest factor
otherwise missing.the rest of the character are a faceless blur -
there are all the usual caricature :
the perky blonde best-friend
who 's a bit of a floozy ;
the smitten local cop
who 's a bit of a dork ;
the protective older man
who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine ;
the scheming old witch 
etc. 
etc. 
yawn 
yawn .
as with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror movie ' issue 
none of the theme
that they mention
( and that london 's character mention - so scathingly - in his attack on poe 's writing )
are followed through on .
as another reviewer said
- there was potential here :
murder 
incest 
- genuinely shocking stuff ,
but instead they skirt away from the issue ,
and cut away from the violence
( a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it is victim - then
-- -cut to black !
this is fine in a noirish traditional horror 
indeed ,
it is expected ,
and is fondly received
when it happens -
it is a dear convention ,
especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolt and intense siouxie eye makeup -
but in 'descendant ' it just comes across as clumsy ,
or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute
and cut it out . )
this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller
- the horror of palingenesis/delusion/madness - or a simple
( and fun ) slasher movie :
it tries to be both 
or neither
( something new and exciting !
) 
but either way it fails dismally .
the only horror element of this entire movie is it is epic dullness.i think the editor
( if there was one at all )
must have been drunk
when s/he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scene ;
scene
that appeared to be out of order
( but that could have just been the poor script ) .
likewise the director and cinematographer - there were some very strange shot and framing
that
i think
were meant to be tribute to hitchcock or browning ,
but just ended up looking silly
( again 
fine in a noir ,
but this was trying to be something else .
) the whole thing perhaps may have been funny
( in that way
that previous reviewer have mentioned -
`` omg how did this get made ? ! ? '' )
if i had been in the mood for some trash- bagging ,
unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch 
with the light down low 
with the express intention
of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film ,
and i am afraid i can not recommend it to person 
not even for laughs.please 
please 
do not waste your time or money on this -
either borrow a real horror/thriller film ,
or find yourself a copy of poe 's fantastical tale ,
either way 
you will have a far more enjoyable and frightening night
than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish .
