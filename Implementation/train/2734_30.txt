was not sure what to expect from this film .
i love watching brosnan in any movie ,
he is always good ,
but this was totally different .
he is a mess ,
and plays being a mess very well .
in fact he reminded me of myself a few time back in uni : )
so yes ,
there is not a lot of violence ,
there is not a lot of action ,
but the dialogue is cracking ,
the acting is superb and very refreshing ,
and it is pretty funny too : )
i do not think
you will come out of the cinema going `` wow !
i was blown away '' ,
but you will come out smiling
having enjoyed a good film .
can not ask for more than that.oh ,
and
if you are lucky ,
some moron will put the advert reel in wrong
and you will get inverted ,
upside down 
reversed
( with reversed audio )
advert ! !
brilliant .
nothing like watching a jack daniels ad
where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american `` twin peak '' commentary : )
