the comeback starts off looking promising 
with a utal death scene by a mask wearing killer .
the mask itself is pretty cool too ,
and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990 's slasher film `` granny '' .
from then on the film is mostly boring .
we get a few more death ,
which again are good ,
but there is not enough of them .
the reason
the death are so good is
because they are frenzied and bloody .
the story behind the film is actually rather interesting
and would have worked very well
had it not been so boring for the most part .
i would avoid this
unless you are a die-hard collector -
there is not enough here
to even make it an average slasher flick .
