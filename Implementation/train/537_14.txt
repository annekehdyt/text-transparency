i loved this movie .
you have to respect midget
that dressed up like tiny martian .
sure the story may have been thin at time ,
but you can not take away from the way
it was done .
i used to watch this over and over again
when i was 8. its a kid movie 
and beside ,
it has some of the greatest quote ever .
blanzee 's `` home on the range '' rendition is awesome .
very well done
if you ask me 
8 of 10 .
