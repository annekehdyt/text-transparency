`` true '' story of three girl
who go into the wild of connecticut
and end up hunted by a maniac in the wood .
this is the sort of film
that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty year ago to mixed acclaim .
not particularly much of anything
the film works with its low budget to mixed result .
the film is watchable but is not at all scary
( blame how some of the attack scene for that ) .
its the sort of film
that you will probably forget about once you
are done with it .
odd are
that you are never going to think to see this unless its handed
to you by someone and told 
`` here watch this '' ,
which is what happened to me .
if you are handed a copy
give it back ,
the film is not worth the effort
to see it
even if it is watchable .
