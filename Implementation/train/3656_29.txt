set in world depression era prague 
this is the story of an ambitious store clerk
who is falling in love with a mystery woman
with whom he has exchanged romantic letter ,
only to discover
that the mystery woman is none other than the sale girl from his shop ,
who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague .
add a little twist
( the owner is convinced
that his favorite employee -stewart- is having an affair with the owner 's wife ) ,
leaving stewart iefly 'fired ' 
along with an admission
that the sale girl 'liked ' stewart all along ,
the happy ending is inevitable.although very dated
( reference to poverty and -i have a wife and two kid to consider- are over-used ,
along with the indication
that many small object of pleasure 
like a musical cigar box 
are out-of-reach for common person 's enjoyment ) ,
this film is much more effective
( and more credible )
than the 1990s re-make `` you have got mail '' .
in the re-make starring tom hank and meg ryan 
the actual odd of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable
that the viewer 's intelligence is grossly offended .
`` shop around the corner '' is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated 
less hectic 
and more romantic time and place known as a novelist 's utopia .
lover of classic romantic comedy will enjoy this picture !
