this is one of the worst film i
have seen .
the only positive thing i can say
is it was so bad
that is seemed comical .
first off 
there is no plot .
the actor appear to be reading off cue card
and do the dumbest thing .
such as being chased by dead person
but yet wanting to go out and look for their friend .
also the zombie were terrible ,
no where near as fun as any of romero 's work ,
who gets s plug in the movie .
and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flash of the video game in the action sequence .
like we do not get the video game
is about shooting zombie .
also 
all the 20 something
some how know how to use automatic weapon
and hit a target
without even aiming the gun .
and the way the person die is so stupid .
it is like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting
to be jumped on .
and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo
instead of shooting the door open ,
so dumb.final verdict :
if any of these actor appear in another film ,
then they have been blessed with a second chance .
definitely the worst film i have seen in year .
a b-movie on cinemax is better .
