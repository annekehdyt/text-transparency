matt saunder
( luke wilson )
thinks
he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson
( uma thurman ) ,
who seems like a quiet but pretty woman ,
though he soon learns
that she is needy and possessive 
oh ,
and she is also the superhero g-girl ,
though you would not know it from the thing
she does to matt
after he freaks out and eaks up with her.a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution .
my super ex-girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy
however
it relies too much on cheap sex joke
and it ends up being a forgettable experience .
what went wrong ?
the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i did not like the way
they played it out .
i was expecting the guy
to be a jerk
and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film .
however 
they made the guy likable
and they made the superhero a psycho .
it just was not very fresh and after about forty minute ,
the film wore out
it is welcome .
sure 
there were a few funny line
however the weak middle and horrible ending
kept
it from really eaking out.director ivan reitman has lost his touch .
after a successful run in the eighty and early ninety 
he started making crap like evolution and father 's day .
i would not say
my super ex-girlfriend is a complete bust
but i do not give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds ,
which is not too much .
don payne did an awful job with the screenplay .
the majority of the joke were lame
and most of the supporting character were just one-note .
he also kept reusing a lot of the same joke
making the thing
really tedious at times.a few of the actor were good enough
to save the film .
uma thurman was great as g-girl
and she had many funny line .
luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting .
i do not think
he makes for an appealing leading man
and he is better in supporting role like in the family stone .
anna faris was just doing her `` scary movie '' routine
and it is getting a little old .
she needs a challenge or at least some better script .
wanda syke is either hit or miss for me .
she was great in monster-in-law
and she was bad in clerk 2. here ,
she is just annoying
and does not ing anything to the movie .
eddie izzard was alright 
nothing special .
rainn wilson was just annoying and not funny .
overall 
i was disappointed with the movie .
it was not awful yet
it had so much potential
and the final result was just so average .
rating 5/10
