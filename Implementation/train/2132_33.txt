like some of the other reviewer have alluded to previously ,
i would like to know what moron actually read the script and went ' 
`` yea ! ! !
this is it .
this is the next film
we are going to green light ! ! ''
and whoever that person is ,
should have his or her head examined for actual ain activity .
because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made
after reading the script 
well 
i would love to give you my email address
and maybe you would like to just give away some more money .
this film is atrocious in every way.the wayan are funny ,
at least they can be .
they have made some good film
and had some incredibly funny performance along the way .
but in here 
not only does the premise defy all logic ,
not only is the acting terrible ,
not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish ,
not only is the direction as amateurish
as you can find ,
but they actually want you to pay to see this film .
maybe
if it was free ... naaah ,
it would still be a waste of time.usually i would be inclined to write some long winded ,
detailed review about why this film is so bad ,
but just suffice to say
that let my evity do the talking .
this is the lowest common denominator film
making
and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack.0/10..makes my top ten list of worst film of all time !
