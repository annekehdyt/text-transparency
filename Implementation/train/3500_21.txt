oh dear .
good cast ,
but to write and direct is an art
and to write wit
and direct wit is a bit of a task .
even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right .
im not putting it all down there were part where i laughed loud
but that was at very few time .
the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue ,
that made some person in the film annoying .
it may sound great
while reading the script in your head
but getting that out and to the camera is a different task .
and the hand held camera work
does give energy to few part of the film .
overall direction was good
but the script was not all that to me ,
but i am sure
you was reading the script in your head
it would sound good .
sorry .
