***spoiler*** do not read this ,
if you think
about watching that movie ,
although it would be a waste of time .
( by the way :
the plot is so predictable
that it does not make any difference
if you read this or not anyway )
if you are wondering whether to see `` coyote ugly '' or not :
do not !
it is not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs / dvd .
a typical `` chick-feel-good-flick '' 
one could say .
the plot itself is as shallow
as it can be 
a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream .
the young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york .
the few desperate attempt of giving the movie any depth fail 
such as the `` tragic '' accident of the father 
the `` difficulty '' of violet 's relationship with her boyfriend 
and so on .
mcnally
( director )
tries to arouse the audience 's pity and sadness put does not have any chance
to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting .
especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of `` jersey 's '' fear
of singing in front of an audience .
the only good
( and quite funny thing )
about `` coyote ugly '' is john goodman ,
who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.i was very astonished ,
that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie .
first `` gone in 60 second ''
and now this ... what happened to great movie like `` the rock '' and `` con air '' ?
that was true bruckheimer stuff.if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking woman
just to have a relaxed evening ,
you should better go and see `` charlie 's angel ''
( it is much more funny 
entertaining and self-ironic )
instead of this flick.two thumbs down
( 3/10 ) .
