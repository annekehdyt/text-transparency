it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays .
it is like all
you need is a camera 
a group of person
to be your cast and crew 
a script ,
and a little money and walla you have a movie .
problem is that talent is not always part of this equation
and often times these kind of low budget film turn out to be dud .
the video store shelve are filled with these
so called film .
these are not even guilty pleasure ,
they are just a waste of celluloid
that are better off forgotten .
troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema ,
but most of their film are b movie gold .
however 
some of the film
they have put out
they had nothing to do with making and some 
like 'nightmare weekend 
'
did not deserve any form of release at all .
pro :
the cast member do the best
they can with the lousy material .
some unintentional hilarity .
move at a good pace
( should at 81 minute )
.con :
awful writing ,
which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot hole .
poorly lit 
especially the night scene and the ending ,
which you can not make out at all .
does not make a lick of sense .
badly scored .
cheap and very dated effect .
total lack of character development and you will not care about anybody .
this is supposed to be a horror film ,
but it is lacking in that area
and is not the least bit scary .
nothing interesting or exciting happen .
loaded with unnecessary padding.final thought :
i never expected this to be some forgotten gem ,
but i never imagined
it would be this bad .
i do not know
if it is the worst film ever made ,
but it is a definite contender .
troma should have let this film rot
instead of giving it a release .
do not make the same mistake i did
and let your curiosity get the best of you.my rating :
1/5
