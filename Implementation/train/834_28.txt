like talk radio 
the booth is actually kinda predictable
( talk radio
because we know the truth
of what happened going in ,
the booth
because of- let 's face it- the genre and the basic set-up ) .
that is not necessarily a bad thing 
in this case .
it means 
in essence ,
that the filmmaker do not punk out in the end the way
they might 've in 
say 
an american version of this story .
the booth moves inexorably toward its
( foregone )
conclusion ,
but is so beautifully crafted on every level
that one can enjoy the ride the way
one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch
of ( very scenic ) road .
it reminds me of harlan ellison 's spooky short story 
flop sweat .
the claustrophobia is 
at time 
almost palpable .
worth a nice long look .
