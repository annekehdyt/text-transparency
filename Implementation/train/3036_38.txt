i first saw this movie 3 year ago ,
and it was introduced by then disney chief eisner and the real jim morris.about a month ago ,
it came back on tv ,
and this time i taped it .
since then i must 've watched it at least three times.this is a wonderful 
inspirational ,
feel good movie
that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned .
it resists going for every sentimental trick in the book ,
as well as all of the other clich\u00e9s.it is refreshing to see a movie
where the kid are not jerk
and have a whole slew of behavioral issue ,
and the jock are not portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.these are just normal person
who have dream like you and i.in my opinion ,
hollywood as gone the other extreme
to what they term `` gritty realism '' ,
making movie where everyone curses ,
and has problem with aggression.this movie is about a man
who has a dream ,
and is encouraged by friend and family
to pursue that dream .
the person in big lake tx seem so personable
that i want to move there.as i said b4 ,
the film does not try to go overboard with sentimentality .
dennis quaid 
as usual 
never disappoint .
i have watched him from the late 70 's ,
and he is so underrated.but this movie has excellent performance from everyone concerned ,
and kudos to the writers.a gem in the movie is near the end
when jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game ,
and his wife calls out to him from the stand .
he rushes over
and reaches out to his family .
the look on the faces of the three other pitcher
sitting on the bench in the dugout
is priceless.if you are looking for a change of pace ,
then pick this movie up .
