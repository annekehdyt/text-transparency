this movie is not porn ,
it was not meant to be porn ,
and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.now
that
that issue was sorted out ,
i can say
i thoroughly recommend this film ,
as it is issue are still widely available .
it is funny ,
the acting is great
and it raises serious
( curious )
questions.i can not fully understand
why this film was so mistreated ,
probably this is why i plan to never visit the us .
lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement 
confusion 
curiosity and wit are her main attribute ,
she is occasionally angry ,
but are not we all ?
