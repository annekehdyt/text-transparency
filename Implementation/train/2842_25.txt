the first one was the best .
the second one sucked
because the dialog was terrible .
although 
the storyline was not so bad
( in fact ,
all story line are good and bad ) .
throughout the movie 
i dosed off a few time .
i know
that jackie chan is a great martial art expertise ,
but not a good actor in rush hour 2. chris tucker 
too 
was not good .
and zhang ziyi 
what can i say 
a few line 
terrible acting
( but that is based on her script ) .
all the character there were not that good .
but 
some of the thing i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scene .
i know
that jackie chan does not do those thing
which is good for him .
