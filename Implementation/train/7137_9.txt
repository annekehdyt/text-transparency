the film adaptation of jame joyce 's ulyss is excellent .
the actor 
the voice over 
the direction 
it all captures the feel of the novel
without sacrificing its own merit .
the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom 
the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly .
i absolutely love this picture .
