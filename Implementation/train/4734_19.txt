i first saw this movie in my play and playwright course at tulane .
i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documantary was .
it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude .
the family is fascinating
and i thought
it really showed little edie at her core .
**as a side note my professor even told me
that throughout the filming 
little edie became infatuated with one of the camera man .
** the beauty 
i find 
comes from the naturalness of the family 's dysfunction .
it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter
that neither could function in society alone
and you begin to wish for little edie 's rehabilitation to society .
in all 
the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality
and it is portrayal of surprising beauty .
two thumb way up !
