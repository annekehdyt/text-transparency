this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking .
jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie ,
thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie .
the film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness
after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair .
unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random `` survival event ''
( including two especially hokey scene
involving fighting a bear )
and strange hallucination
that make you wonder
if this kid is not just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot
dreaming up this whole movie
( and what a nightmare it is ! ) .
furthermore ,
despite the herald of some reviewer of the family viewability of the film ,
there are several scene not suitable for very young child or family viewing ,
including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eye apparently exploded.all in all 
a terrible movie
that nobody should be subjected to 
much less innocent kid .
