this is a film
which should be seen by anybody interested in 
effected by 
or suffering from an eating disorder .
it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl 
its cause and its symptom .
the girl is played by one of the most illiant young actress
working in cinema today 
alison lohman ,
who was later so spectacular in 'where the truth lies ' .
i would recommend
that this film be shown in all school ,
as you will never see a better on this subject .
alison lohman is absolutely outstanding 
and one marvel at her ability
to convey the anguish of a girl
suffering from this compulsive disorder .
if barometer tell us the air pressure ,
alison lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy .
her emotional range is so precise ,
each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradation of trauma 
on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation
which reaches unbearable intensity .
mare winningham is the perfect choice
to play her mother ,
and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotion just as finely tuned as lohman 's .
together 
they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillator viating in resonance with one another .
this film is really an astonishing achievement ,
and director katt shea should be proud of it .
the only reason for not seeing
it is if you are not interested in person .
but even if you like nature film best ,
this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge .
bulimia is an extreme version
of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair .
and if we do not sympathise with person suffering from the depth of despair ,
then we are dead inside .
