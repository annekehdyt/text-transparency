i despise horror movie ,
that is no secret .
no plot 
bad acting and gallon of blood are staple of these mistake of cinema ,
and this `` movie '' is no exception .
i can not believe
some cable station actually run this garbage .
( this particular garbage was released straight-to-video 
as i recall . )
as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie ,
i say this :
all of the phantasm movie 
all of the jason movie 
freddy movie 
chucky movie 
and most of the michael myer movie can be summed up in one word :
terrible ! !
! rating
( phantasm iii ) :
0.5/10
