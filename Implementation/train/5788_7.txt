this movie makes a promising start
and then gets very confused and muddled .
kamal hasan has made a lot of effort
in getting the period look right ,
pity he did not spend more time on the plot .
most of the small character in the movie show up for no particular reason.overall very disappointing ,
i would recommend avoiding this movie .
