i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm 's `` essential '' series .
the eye of the beholder clich\u00e9 was never more apropos .
this beholder saw little of value in this one .
i was puzzled by the infinite attraction
that lucy
( lauren bacall )
possessed .
granted 
ms. bacall was a beautiful woman ,
but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive .
i would think
man like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her .
in bacall 's defense 
this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart 's last illness
and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance .
of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee 
played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone .
the scene
where she engages in a wildly sensual dance
while her father wearily climbs the stair to a fatal heart attack
is far
and away the best scene in the film .
malone 's performance outshines the rest 
although jasper hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two child is illiantly portrayed by robert keith .
generally 
though 
i would have to say
that i am just not much of a fan of melodrama .
the cartoonish behavior of the character just makes for a story too implausible for my taste .
