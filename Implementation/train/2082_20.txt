i have probably been spoilt
by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack
so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment .
i just did not get any chemistry between the 2 main star .
a lot of staring and theatrical acting just does not do it for me ,
and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester .
had the casting director
actually ever read the book .
very strange !
he is a fine actor
but mr. rochester he definitely is not !
and zelah was just 
well 
strange 
bit of a mix matched couple .
in it is favour the supporting cast were pretty good
and the lowood scene for me were the best of the adaptation ,
but overall did not capture any of the magic of the novel .
certainly would not ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel .
a real let down !
