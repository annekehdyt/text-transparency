***might not consider this having a spoiler ,
but i would rather be cautious
than careless*** i never saw this movie
when i was little .
i fell in love
with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter .
i can watch it over
and over again.for the little acting ilene wood did in her lifetime ,
she was a wonderful voice for cinderella ; very appealing ; very believable .
the music really fit the movie perfectly .
the acting was great ;
loved the mice ! !
you really `` hated '' lady tremain and the step-sister ;
they were just awful .
the cartoonist depicted
the spoiled behavior very well.this is a wonderful movie ,
especially if you are into love story .
my daughter has seen the movie about 25 time
and still gets excited at the end .
