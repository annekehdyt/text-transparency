after reading the book ,
i happened across this dvd at wal-mart for 3 buck
and thought 
sure ,
what the hell ... i got the dvd
and watched it last night .
when i started watching it ,
i checked the run time
and it was about 90 minute .
i thought 
ok cool ... it seemed to run rather slowly ,
knowing the story
and how much of it there was .
by the time i got to the actual killing ,
i was like ,
`` how much time does this have left ? ''
checked .
`` one minute ? !
what the hell ? ! ''
i felt incredibly cheated ,
thinking
that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story.but then ,
i happily noticed
that the dvd 's scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2. i still had another hour and a half
to go !
i then sat very happily
and enjoyed the second half of the movie ,
even more so than the first.i admit
that i have not seen the 1967 original film
( despite my sincerest desire to ) ,
i have however read the novel
and felt
that this was a fairly descent film 
for a two-part tv miniseries ,
that is .
i think
the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong
and a few minor inconsistency jumped out at me ,
but still very well done .
the first half drag on a bit ,
while the second half is much more gripping .
i think
they should have proportioned the movie
more like capote did his book :
1/3 before the murder 
1/3 after 
and 1/3 after the killer are arrested .
instead 
the film makes it more 1/2 before the murder 
1/4 after ,
and 1/4 after the killer are arrested .
again 
this makes the second half more exciting 
but at the same time 
less compelling
while making the first half drag on and on ... now i look back
and realize i have just made the same mistake
about making thing drag on and on ,
so i will shut the hell up .
go watch the movie
and make up your own damn mind !
