not only was this movie better than all the final season of h :
lot .
but it was better than any movie
made for tv i
have ever seen !
looking at the `` top 250 '' i see
that only one small screen movie has made it :
how the grinch stole christmas .
i think
it is time to increase
that group to 2.i will admit
that the original series had several show
that were better than this ,
but i did not mind .
i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again !
