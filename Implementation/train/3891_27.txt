this is one of the funniest show
i have ever seen .
it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitch many time .
i guess
there is a social awareness factor to this too
which makes it quite interesting .
if these were white girl would
they get the same reaction ?
maybe they would ,
maybe they would not ?
the character know no limit
( check my lyric )
and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun !
there are so many funny sketch .
my favorite is the bob the builder one .
it is so silly
it is genius .
if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you .
if you like keeping up appearance
it probably is not.3 non blonde 's is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy
shown on tv !
it is such a funny show
and the character unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny !
it would be impossible to keep a straight face
watching the crazy character and the reaction of the public !
this series easily adds to the excellent comedy
being produced !
