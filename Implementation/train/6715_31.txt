after a promising first 25 minute
that makes you feel all warm inside ,
you are pretty convinced
that this will be a great romantic comedy .
then the movie takes a turn for the worse .
the warm feeling might still be there ,
but as other has said :
the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial
that it is almost unbearable to watch .
the movie gets sped up ,
and you get the impression
that you are either fast forwarding through it ,
or that the producer decided to fit it in less than 1h40m
and had to cut a lot of scene out.realism
is not a goal onto itself 
but as a viewer 
i am pretty convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic ,
it just happens to be.on the plus side ,
this movie has a couple of nice interior ,
and despite the bad script ,
i think
that the actor performance are mainly good .
if i could rate the first 25 minute only ,
i would probably give it an eight .
as it is now ,
it gets a four .
... and that is being nice !
if you are a sucker for romantic comedy
you will probably have a great time anyway .
if not 
i would recommend that you watch something else .
