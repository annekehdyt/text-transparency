this is possibly one of the worst movie i have ever seen .
i do not care what the critic say ,
it is bad .
i think
the problem is with kundera 's novel .
it is not that it is unfilmable ;
it is just that like 99 % of his work ,
it is pretentious and overdrawn .
he seems to be enamored with himself ,
his character come off as navel-gazing ,
and his novel as a whole are misogynistic .
i have read many of his work
( even his socialist realist poetry .
that was truly awful )
-- i just do not understand what the fuss is about .
characteristic
( like the self-absorption )
in his novel make for infuriating reading .
in a movie 
all the thing
that i dislike about kundera
were magnified .
maybe i just missed something ,
but i do not think so .
on a side note 
i can not believe
that this is a criterion collection dvd .
no way is this movie that essential .
