...
mainly because ju-on 2 boast an outrageous forty minute ' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju-on -
and
when you consider
that the sequel only runs for 76 minute ,
that leaves you with 36 original minute ' worth of film .
ho-hum .
i found
that deeply irritating -
as if viewer simply would not remember the same stuff !
- not to mention dull ,
having to watch it all over again.ok ,
that complaint aside 
the byline for ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered question from the first movie ,
which frankly 
over 36 minute 
simply does not go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original 's highly convoluted storyline.there are 
however 
some really nice new horror sequence
which show how good the film might have been ,
had it had some time to develop ;
and some of the question
raised by the original - some ,
but not all - are answered.so in conclusion -
if you loved the first original movie
and want to see some further development on the story ,
go for it -
but just remember to keep your remote control
to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minute .
