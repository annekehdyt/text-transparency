well i was not sure
what the film was going to be like
as i had only seen a little clip
but i was thinking its going to be good
and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it
and well it is my favourite film.i think
alison lohan played the part of beth really well
she is such a grate actress
and the writer must have gone into a lot of research
to find out about bulimia although the ending
when beth is in the hospital an has 2 horus observation after meal
because iv been told like 1 house is ok
and also that hospital does not help bulimic
as iv been told
which is probably why i am still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia
but this is a grate film i
recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for person
who know some one with eating disorder
as it can let them in to the life of a bulimic person
and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film
and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
