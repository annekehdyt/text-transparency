that is certainly a strange way
to promote a film upon
which a great deal rested .
and it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio ,
given that
( 1 )
the feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie 's release .
( 2 )
the feud between the producer
( robert fryer )
and director
( michael sarne )
was also common knowledge .
( 3 ) the cast made no secret of their contempt for the film
and made it public at every opportunity ,
with daily bulletin from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnist everywhere.and
( 4 )
the author 
gore vidal hated it practically from day one .
nevertheless ,
that tagline just about sum it up .
raquel welch does give a decent performance as myra ,
and she looks lovely beside .
john huston is very funny as buck loner 
the ex-cowboy star
who runs a phony acting academy .
mae west ,
( in her first screen appearance since 1943 )
naturally rewrote her part to suit herself ,
and she is great as ''oversexed ''
( and that is putting it mildly )
''talent agent '' leticia van allen .
still 
she must have wondered
( after waiting so long for a good vehicle
in which to return )
how she ever ended up in this mess.tom selleck
( in his film debut )
is one of her ''client '' .
john carradine and jim backus 
as doctor 
also amble in iefly .
rex reed as myron 
farrah fawcett and roger herren 
as the victim of myra/myron 's sexual passion 
are neither here nor there .
the same goes for the script ,
which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book ,
but seems to head in at least three different direction at once .
although west 's part was originally larger ,
she was reduced to a cameo role by the time sarne
was through with the editing .
and ,
partly because of this ,
she seems to be in a different movie .
apparently 
at some point 
the producer realized
that mae was going to be the film 's big draw ,
and 
unable to replace most of her cut footage ,
they rushed her back to the set at the end
of filming for the second of her two song ,
both of which come out of nowhere .
the device sarne used of throwing in old film clip of bygone star to emphasize whatever point
he was making ,
does not work at all .
by the time the movie concludes 
all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about .
not surprisingly ,
just about everyone
connected with the production
felt the same way ,
and it died at the box office .
a technically flawless dvd includes ,
( among other extra )
separate commentary from both welch and sarne ,
each of whom have completely opposite opinion
of just what went wrong.no doubt
it is home video re-release was prompted by a 2001 '' vanity fair '' piece ,
which attempted
( in great detail )
to do the same thing .
true 
the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking 
but ,
with sarne at the helm of what was obviously a ''troubled '' production ,
it really never had a chance .
