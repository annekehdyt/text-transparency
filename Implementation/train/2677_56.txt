murder in mesopotamia 
i have always considered one of the better poirot book ,
as it is very creepy
and has an ingenious ending .
there is no doubt
that the tv adaptation is visually striking 
with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score .
as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot 
the comedic highlight of the episode
being poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night ,
and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hasting .
the remainder of the cast turn in decent performance ,
but are careful not to overshadow the two lead 
a danger in some christie adaptation .
some of the episode was quite creepy 
a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pig 
an episode
that i enjoyed a lot more than this one .
what made it creepy in particular ,
putting aside the music was
when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window .
about the adaptation 
it was fairly faithful to the book ,
but i will say
that there were three thing
i did not like .
the main problem was the pacing ,
it is rather slow ,
and there are some scene
where very little happen .
i did not like the fact
also that they made joseph mercado a murderer .
in the book 
i see him as a rather nervous character ,
but the intervention of the idea
of making him a murderer ,
and under-developing that ,
made him a less appealing character ,
though i am glad
they did not miss his drug addiction .
( i also noticed
that the writer left out the fact
that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria
when she believes
she is the murderer 's next victim . )
the other thing
that was not so impressive
was that i felt
that it may have been more effective
if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran ,
like it was in the book ,
amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation .
on the whole ,
despite some misjudgement on the writer ' behalf ,
i liked murder in mesopotamia .
