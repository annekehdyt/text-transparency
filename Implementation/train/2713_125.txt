this review is mostly all spoiler .
if you plan on enjoying this film ,
do not read this review .
that is the problem with kid tv nowaday .
it is all so patronizing and condescending .
`wow ,
that was fun ,
was not it ? '
no it was not .
and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into child film as well .
and that is what 'flight of the reindeer ' is all about .
admittedly i have not seen 'flight of the reindeer ' in a few year
so i might be hazy on some point ,
but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time .
essentially 
the story follows a lecturer
who is given a book for christmas .
now 
the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habit of some animal .
i think
it was bullfrog .
anyway 
through this book 
mr lecturer / family man learns
that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrog .
apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundred of year ago
who disappeared in the north pole .
now ,
if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window .
flying bullfrog are a naturally occurring phenomenon ,
but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept .
but 
mr lecturer is not me ,
so i guess
that explains
why he decide to fly to the north pole
leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea
where he is gone .
of course 
thing go awry
and before he knows it ,
a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane
and he is stranded at the north pole .
are you still following this ?
good .
his family 
of course 
are devastated .
i would be too 
i mean 
what a suck-tacular christmas .
elsewhere 
mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midget and one tyrannical figure
who dresses only in red and white .
rather than try to escape immediately ,
as i would have done ,
he greets everyone there with open arm .
this hidden civilization of midget monster ,
and he greets them with open arm .
oooo-kayyyy .
they feed him this story
that they are the elf of santa claus
and they spend all year
round
making toy for kid
they have no idea exist .
and mr lecturer accepts all this .
he even accepts
that santa claus is in fact the scientist
who disappeared two hundred year ago or whatever .
there is just one problem -
they do not want him to leave .
the world can not know of their secret existence .
after all ,
before they had know
it there 'd be a mcdonald and a starbuck on every street corner .
still with me ? now 
mr nice guy 's family find the book
and assume
he is gone to the north pole .
boy 
would not they be embarrassed
if they found out he had just gone for a isk walk ?
before the audience knows it ,
they are jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet .
meanwhile 
mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midget
and decide to leave .
i can not remember exactly ,
but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint .
a fire fight ensue
when the midget attack and he manages to escape via santa 's sleigh .
with santa hot on his heel and with bloodlust in his eye 
mr whatever 
through some marvellous co-incidence 
finds himself flying alongside his family 's plane
that is looking for him .
so he jumps on to their plane ,
the plane fly back and everyone life happily ever after .
the fact is ,
there have been some shocking film made in the name of christmas over the year
but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it .
and it is that charm
that is utterly devoid from 'flight of the reindeer ' there is not much wrong with it ;
nothing
which insults the intelligence
( well ,
obviously there is ,
but it is a kid film
and thus can get away with such thing )
or anything particularly offensive ,
but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either .
it just does not feel christmassy .
and for a film
that is all about christmas ,
that it a pretty major flaw .
but hey 
i do not think 'flight of the reindeer 's target audience mind about that ?
why should they ?
they are all so doped up on sedative
they probably could not spell `christmas ' i give it three out of ten .
if it was a tv-movie
then i would add another two star onto it .
we all know
how bad they can get .
