went to see this movie
hoping to see some flash of the jet li
we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4. unfortunately
too many of his fight stunt are so clearly fake
that it took even that enjoyment out of it .
the flying kick would be a lot more impressive
if you could not see the wire holding him up
as he flies through the air for 4 second and 9 kick.too cartoonish and very disappointing .
