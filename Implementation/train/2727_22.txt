in this paranoia-driven potboiler 
our reporter hero battles hindersome authority 
duplicitous co-worker 
renegade ufo debunker 
and silent 
skulking alien .
( though capable of mind control and zapping object from afar ,
it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen button . )
the script clomp from event to event ,
leaving puzzler aplenty .
why did the alien blind the dog ?
why do they fry the soldier with radiation
when they are only patrolling an empty landing site ?
and what space dude worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model ?
inquiring mind want to know !
writer-director mario gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of ufo-themed tabloid
as he took in a sunn classic double feature .
( the closing screen crawl boasts
that it is based on actual event ...
just like `` plan 9 ! '' )
some may feel burned by the aupt finale ,
but it should still appeal to conspiracy crank .
