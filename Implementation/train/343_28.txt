to anyone
who might think
this show is not for them ,
please give it a try .
network television has degenerated into show
that are clone of clone or are reality
based show
featuring some often unreal person .
this show is a return to family oriented tv
where the emphasis is on learning some life lesson ,
learning what real friend and family are about ,
and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime .
jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actor in show business today ,
and he is perfectly cast as the young 
slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empire
( great name ! ) .
dean cain 
christopher lloyd 
mare winningham 
and kirsten storm round out the main cast ,
and they are all exceptional .
this show deserves a chance
to catch on
and be seen .
hopefully it will stick around for a few season
and we can watch pete young
( sumpter 's character )
learn and grow .
