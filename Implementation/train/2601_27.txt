i saw a special advance screening of this today .
i have to let you know ,
i am not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell ,
so i really had no expectation going into this .
i ended up
enjoying
it quite a bit.dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughter
who goes to spend a weekend with his family .
while at a bookstore ,
he meets the woman of his dreams ,
only to find out
that she happens to be his other 's girlfriend.this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack 
cinematography ,
and acting are all top-notch 
especially steve carell .
my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development 
mostly with dane cook 's character .
we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve 's character ,
and i felt
that it could have helped a bit in showing
what dan 's inner conflict
about being in love with dane 's girlfriend
was like .
other than this though 
dan in real life is definitely a solid 
sweet film- definitely a nice eak from all the horror and action movie
we have been getting this year .
