i am sorry ,
i had high hope for this movie .
unfortunately 
it was too long 
too thin and too weak
to hold my attention .
when i realized
the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream ,
i felt cheated .
surely it could have been a device to ing us into something deeper 
something more meaningful.so ,
do not buy a large drink
or you will be running to the rest room .
my kid did not enjoy it either .
ah well .
