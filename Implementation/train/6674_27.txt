i am a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad ,
i felt embarrassed for not only the `` actor '' ,
but also the director and the poor sap of a producer
who actually put his money up for this schlock.from the title ,
you would expect some great carnage 
somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog .
instead 
you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooge episode .
at least i laugh at the three stooge .
while watching this crap ,
i turned another tv on
and started watching howard stern
until something interesting happened.needless to say ,
i kept watching stern.watching this `` film '' i realize
that i could produce a film with three monkey 
2 dv camera 
$ 50 dollar in loose change and a oken pc .
this film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making .
watch this movie
if you dare ,
but be warned ...
there is a lot of nothing in here
but a whole lot
of talking and very little action .
this makes `` kazaam '' look like a meryl streep film.i am
sure germany did not ban it due to sex or violence .
other country need to take heed .
