with the advent of the imdb 
this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience .
why ?
because user here
who do a search on two-time academy award winner glenda jackson
can find 'the return of the soldier ' among her credit .
so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie .
fan of ann-margret can give the title a click ,
as will those
looking into the career of the great alan bate .
not to mention the added bonus of a movie
with supporting heavyweight ian holm and frank finlay .
any movie with so many notable in it is rewarded by the imdb ,
given all the cross-referencing
that goes on here .
so 
why is not this movie out on dvd ?
do not the producer realize
the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film ?
and 'the return of the soldier ' is definitely a gem waiting
to be discovered .
get with it 
person .
