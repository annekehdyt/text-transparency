antwone fisher 's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us
who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster child .
abandoned by a troubled mother ,
antwone has never met his father .
growing up with `` church going '' abuser
who use the `` n-word '' not only to intimidate and hurt
but also as a term of endearment ,
as a young man witnessing
how his best friend is killed in a hold-up 
enduring racial slur
and being teased
while serving in the navy ,
antwone 's anger is slowly turned into positive power
when counseled by a navy psychiatrist ,
and a love enters his life.the scene
where antwone meets his birth mother
is one of the most powerful moment in the film .
stunned by the unexpected confrontation ,
the woman listens in silence
to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life
without crime 
addiction to drug 
fathering child left and right ,
all despite his utterly adverse circumstance.if
that scene was not powerful enough ,
the very next one drives it home
( and opens the flood gate ) :
a reception to welcome home antwone ;
dozen of smiling faces and open arm announcing
that he is part of this great family.one of the message
delivered by this wonderful film
is that there are many well-meaning and sincere person
working
to help orphan and unwanted child .
even if some of the home and administrator do not seem to care and appear self-serving ,
many do give it their all .
the character
who found antwone 's `` file ''
once he disclosed
the circumstance of his birth is one of those `` ight light '' in the darkness of the system.the dvd includes a french language

as well as additional feature and information about foster parenting.as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage .
