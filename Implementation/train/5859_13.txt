i first saw `` breaking glass ''
when it was released in england in 1980..i loved it then
and having just caught it in august 2005 on a canadian station
it still is great .
the only thing i regret is i can not find the sound track or the dvd in the store ?
? ... anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company .
but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time ,
hazel/kate had something to say about 80 's britain..actually
it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reason one being `` thatcher ''
and what she was doing to the country at the time .
please
if you get the chance watch this movie
you will not be sorry !
