i have not seen this movie ,
but i must .
having read all three of thor heyerdahl 's book
( kon tiki 
ra and aku aku )
i am actively looking for a copy of this movie.the thesis
that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well .
considering that this crew had no gps ,
and only an old fashioned valve
( tube )
radio with a 6-watt output ,
their voyage was heroic to say the least.please reply to this message
if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.i would be interested in buying it .
