in the film `` brokedown palace 
''
directed by jonathan kaplan 
two best friend 
alice
( claire dane )
and darlene
( kate beckinsale )
decide to celeate high school graduation
by taking a trip to hawaii ,
but hear
that bangkok 
thailand 
is much more fun .
they switched plan
and decided to go to thailand
without telling their parent the change of plan .
while they were in thailand ,
alice and darlene met a really handsome guy
named nick park
( daniel lapaine ) .
he tells them
that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy ticket
so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong .
they accepted his offer
and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drug .
they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three year in prison .
i think
kaplan was trying to show the audience
that it is wise to make good decision
because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever .
also 
a friendly face may not be as friendly
as we think
once we find out the real intention
of that friendly face .
those girl made a decision
not to tell their parent
that they had switched their plan
and it changed their life forever .
thing have a funny way of happening
showing us what decision
we have made verse the decision
that we should have made .
sometimes life is not fair ,
that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choice
that we make
because we can never go back
and change the choice
that
we have made.this movie
has a great setting ;
it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand .
this film also has great music ;
a few of my favorite song are 'silence ' by delerium 
'damaged ' by plumb 
'deliver me ' by sarah bightman and 'party 's just begun ' by nelly furtado .
i went out
and bought the soundtrack
after watching this film .
these girl
where young and naive and failed to think their plan out thoroughly 
a mistake
that anyone could make ,
therefore this film is good for any audience .
it makes no difference young or old
-- we all are human and subject to mistake .
even though 
i did not like the way
this film ended leaving me in question
of -- who really smuggled the drug ?
-- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up .
