i watched shore leave the other day .
i have seen it so many time ,
and i never get tired of it .
strangely enough 
every time i watch it lately ,
it takes me right back to the very first time
i saw it .
including this time .
must be that sense of mystery
and `` what is going on here ? ''
about it.oddly enough 
the one part of the story
that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me 
this time ,
actually had a huge effect on me
-- ruth .
i think
a lot of it was gerald fried 's score .
a real masterpiece ,
that !
the romantic section was reused
-- much more extensively --
in this side of paradise .
but of course 
it debuted here .
i get the impression
that 
out of all the girl kirk knew over the year ,
she may have been the `` sweetest '' .
when she said ,
`` do you have to go ?
`` ,
combined with the music ,
i could really feel the pain
she must
have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.someone commented online
that ruth looked older
than he was ,
yet she was not supposed to have aged at all in 15 year .
which makes me think
...
maybe
she was one of the teacher at the academy .
kirk had an affair with an older woman !
( perhaps he thought back to this in `` miri ''
when he told janice ,
`` i never get involved with older woman . ''
maybe he meant 
`` ... anymore .
`` reading st reviews the other day 
i see where someone
compared what are little girl made of ?
with i 
mudd .
but it seems shore leave oughta be in there 
too .
what are all those `` person '' if not android ?
and could `` the caretaker '' be related to `` the old one '' from the earlier episode ?
whoever he is ,
he seems to be one of the rare case in st
where you have a race
that is actually `` superior ''
as opposed to merely thinking
they are.yeoman barrows seems to be filling in for yeoman rand .
considering how much attention dr. mccoy showered on her ,
it is just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character
who appears once
and then never shows up again !
sheesh.one thing
missing from the last several i
have watched
that snuck back in here was 
spock smiling .
he was !
i saw him .
i really prefer knowing
there is 2 side to him going on inside all the time 
rather than this `` submerged '' business .
when he said ,
`` enjoy yourself 
sir . ''
near the beginning 
you could see
it was not just his addressing his superior officer ,
but talking to his friend .
and at the end ,
when he needlessly says ,
`` totally illogical !
`` 
i can not help but think
he does it purely to provoke a reaction .
he may not be smiling or laughing ,
but i think
he likes seeing his fellow crew member around him happy .
