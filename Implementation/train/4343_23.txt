there is a lot of talk of torture these day .
that is all this movie is .
it is about a good person
who makes a bad decision .
because of his kindness ,
he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic woman .
from then on its a just-for-kicks assault on him .
i do not know at what point you do something about it .
there is a wife and child out there somewhere ;
he has great feeling of guilt and fear .
but there should have been some time
when he could have acted .
the movie seems to be somebody 's joke .
i suppose in the wake of the manson murder 
we had a bit of a fixation on the like of these two .
nevertheless 
why would someone make a film like this ?
what appeal does it have except for sadism .
the conclusion is totally unsatisfying ,
but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist .
oh 
well .
another hour and a half of my life .
