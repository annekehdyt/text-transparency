no spoiler here but i have been a fan
since waking the dead started but the last series ,
of which only 3 have been on so far is awful .
the story bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series .
i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous .
as a bbc licence payer 
after the show i rang bbc complaint to pass on my disappointment .
i am amazed
that actor of the calie of trevor eve and sue johnstone did not object to the story line .
these actor have been with these character for 8 season ,
surly they can see
it is lost all direction .
it is a good job
it is the last series or the next series may start with the team
investigating the death of father christmas ! paul bentley 
west yorkshire 
england .
