i can not say
that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made ,
because i have not seen every bollywood film ,
but my imagination tell me
that it could well be.this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director ,
and i for one be believe
he has been successful in his mission .
no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing
as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.but let
not just blame the director here ,
there is the cinematographer ,
who looks like he is rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award .
there is the over dramatic score ,
that hopes to carry you to the next scene .
the lighting man ,
who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other ,
and hoping
that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene .
and 
of course the actor !
some of them are by no means newcomer ,
else all could be forgiven here .
the ensemble of actor in aag were put together
to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of india 's most loved movie of all time 
'sholay ' .
one must not forget
that these actor were not forced in to this film ,
they are a-list and willing participant to something that ,
let 's face
it would surely
have had high and eager public expectation ? ? ?
so it begs the question 
amitabh aside
( for now ) ,
did the other actor really believe
their performance even attempted to better the original ?
did amitabh bachchan read the script
and believe
that person would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film ?
do not be stupid ,
of course
he did not ,
this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talk hence can make actor walk.i truly hope
everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film ,
which only succeeds in polluting everyone 's mind
when they watch the original .
