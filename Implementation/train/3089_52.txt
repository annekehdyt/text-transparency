this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits.every time i watch it ,
i see and hear funny little thing
that i missed before.the soundtrack is unbelievable .
mick jone
( foreigner )
and chris difford
( squeeze )
penned the song ,
making strange fruit the best thing
that ever hit today 's music scene.unfortunately ,
strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up '60 's to 70 's band
that were never good to begin with 
due to drug use and inner fighting .
one wonders what might have been ,
while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack.the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stone 
deep purple 
david bowie ,
and the who.each member of fruit are quite memorable .
stephen rea star as down-and-dead-oke tony costello ,
who is asked by a festival promoter
to reunite his band for a reunion tour ,
with hope of reaping monetary benefit .
costello haply approaches ex-roadie karen knowle ,
played by juliet auey ,
to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past.juliet gather up the bitter jimmy nail
( les wicke ) ,
blundering timothy spall
( david 'beano ' baggot ) ,
and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms
( bill nighy ) .
tumbling in is another ex-roadie 
the hippy-toker-jokester hughie
( billy connolly ) ,
who never let the flame burn out.as juliet search for the last member of their motley band ,
the elusive guitarist-songwriter brian lovell
( played by the ooding bruce robinson ) ,
the reunited member squabble 
just like old time ,
fighting over each other ' rusty talent.the band is then given the chance
to do a small dutch tour ,
to prepare for the festival .
with young hendrix-like luke shand
( han matheson )
taking the place of lovell ,
the crew hits the road .
the spark fly as their memory flame forward ,
threatening to burn their unfinished goal ...
be prepared to laugh 
sing 
cheer 
and cry ,
as these memorable character etch themselves back into your heart ...
