what surprised
me most about this film was the sheer audience
it attracted .
similar film such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has ,
though i think
that is probably because of the mention of 'beckham ' in the title more than anything else.it is a illiant film
putting across a illiant message -
you can do anything
if you are determined enough ,
and put your mind to it ,
which is such a positive message
to anyone watching this film.i think
this is one of keira knightley 's better film ,
and i think
she is a illiant actress ,
and was excellent for the role .
parminder nagra was illiant too .
sadly 
i can not say this for jonathan rhys-meyer ,
because i do not think
that he was that much of a good actor ,
and to be honest ,
his eye were a little scary.all in all 
a illiant film 
and a illiant story
