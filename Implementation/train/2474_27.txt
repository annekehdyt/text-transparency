i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd
and it lived up to my memory of it .
i was very grateful
to be able to view for the first time episode
that were never televised .
i loved `` ring of fire '' in particular of the story i had not seen the first time around.gary cole is fantastic as `` evil 
sexy '' lucas buck .
lucas black as caleb is also a superb player .
i thought
brenda bakke as selena coombs was also superb in her portrayal .
in fact 
the whole cast was fantastically talented
and had great chemistry with each other.it is a shame
the series was screwed by the network
( in collusion with a burgeoning group of censor )
because it was truly designed for adult viewing .
a mixture of comedy 
tragedy 
farce 
satire 
gothic romance and horror genre ,
it offered illiant characterization
supported by acting at the genius level.i
had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life .
long live gary cole
( sheriff lucas buck ) ,
the most luscious `` fallen angel '' ever .
