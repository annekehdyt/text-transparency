although this movie has some weakness ,
it is worth seeing .
i chose it
because of the cast 
and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing role different from those
they have taken in the past .
both portray very troubled person 
complete with wart ,
but make them likeable
because of their humanity .
the story is touching ,
but it is the performance that soar .
bonham carter 's `` jane '' is a remarkable achievement ,
whose quest for romance opened my eye
to aspect of being disabled
that i had not thought of before ,
but was interesting as well for other reason .
i felt
the movie ended too auptly ,
but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending
( see `` stepmom . '' )
the very real english
setting added to my enjoyment -
it was england in the 90 's 
both urban and rural ,
without being depressing .
