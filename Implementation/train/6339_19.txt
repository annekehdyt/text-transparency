as far as the movie goes ,
it is an ok science fiction movie .
it has a lot of cool stuff in it 
and some quality scene .
that said ,
it is not that good ,
and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched ...
as for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh ! t .
this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie ...
the whole feel
to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first ,
but the introduction of people/android as part of the `` team '' behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch ... i
gave this a 3***
because of the backstabbing of the original .
this one should have been kept sterile in so many part of the movie
that there is no place or time
to mention them all ... watchable for those
who have not seen cube and hypercube 
but not recommendable for fan of the series ...
