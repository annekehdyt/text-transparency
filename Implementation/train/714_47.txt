before i start ... let me say
that i fully believe in god .
i believe in heaven and in hell .
kay
now that thats out of the way 
i just wan na say
that what in the world do these moron
that call themselves `` host '' think
they are doing ? ?
the last time i checked a host does not discriminate 
spew hatred filled rant on tv 
or try to shove their own belief down every unfortunate soul
that venture onto the channel .
all of these
that crazy 
idiotic 
conservitive 
bible thumping 
fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily .
i am all for free speech ,
but since when does that cover a guy
who pretty much says
that
if you venture off his ideal way of life
you are right away sent to hell ?
this is just a perfect example
of why religion is the cause of soooo many problem .
one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher
in so we decided to watch some tv
since the teach did not give us any work .
and we
( against many of us 's will )
watched 700 's club 
and of course
that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible ,
and he said
simon along the line of `` god says
homosexuality is a sin ''
and i actually heard a kid go `` hmm i guess
he is right . ''
wtf ? ? ?
seriously ,
if the host is trying to make person think
that someone else 's sexual orientation is a huge sin ,
then they seriously need to take that host 
duct tape them ,
and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic .
