after enjoying this show for year ,
i use to dream of being able to see them all again
and share them with my grandchild .
i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memory
that i have found recorded on dvd .
florida was a caring
mother with a loving hard working husband 
one spoiled beautiful daughter and two son as different as day and night .
michael 
the baby son is a freedom walker
and jj is a clown .
i know many afro-american disliked this show ,
but i know many can relate
and should have accepted it
as it was .
my heart was sad
when i learned
that ester rolle had passed .
tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work 
but not as much
since he made such cruel mocking of rolle in one of his play .
no one should have to hear ugly thing about physical appearance .
the show started getting less interesting
when daddy jame died .
it picked up a bit when florida remarried ,
but slumped
when she took an absence from the show .
in all 
the show was great
and again i am pleased to own copy of part of my past .
i do try to keep up with the work of the former star of good time ,
and i must say ,
they are one group
who has not been wiped up and down with rumor .
i think
child of today will enjoy this show
and i have no problem
sitting and watching with child .
congrat to the writer 
crew 
and star for year of renewed memory of a time
that i can once again enjoy
without having to skip scene.ok
so i watch the show over and over .
lately i have noticed thing
that has made me rethink the series 
but not dislike them .
i think
florida was a bit harsh
when it came to money
that the child made .
not that the child did not need supervision ,
but it was done in a way
that makes florida 's mothering different .
the scene
where florida had to speak
about how other person were not very good looking
bother me now .
when jame was alive ,
the show made a big thing out of jame wanting his own fix-it shop ,
but never lived to see his family out of the project ,
but florida marry someone
who owns a fix-it shop .
a bit of a slap in the face to an actor
who should have ended his time on good time showing
that he accomplished
all he strove for .
lastly ,
as i watch the show ,
i see the series going in to overtime and being renamed `` jj '' .
to be truthful ,
after jame left everything mostly centered around jj .
not a bad thing ,
just a noticeable thing .
i would not trade my dvd 's for any amount of money 
but time 
maturity and experience began to guide your eye after a while .
