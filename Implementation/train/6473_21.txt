when i saw
that this movie was being shown on tv ,
i was really looking forward to it .
i grew up in the 1980 's and like everyone else
who has grown up in that era ,
have seen every 80 's teen and summer camp movie out there .
so i could not wait to see this movie
that totally spoofs that film genre .
what a disappointment ! !
the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad joke and gag over and over 
with hardly any plot and no substance .
and the filmmaker attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called joke did not come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive .
the only good thing about this film were the wardrobe 
music 
and acting .
it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing style from the 80 's ,
and the same goes for the music .
and the acting was top-notch throughout :
almost all of hollywood 's best comedian were present .
too bad
they did not have better material to work with .
