like his early masterpiece `` the elephant man '' lynch proves to his detractor
that he can tell a straight 
simple story
without losing his artistic touch .
this is a true story of an elderly retired man
( expertly
played by richard farnsworth )
who decides to ride a tractor across a few state
to pay a final visit to his estranged other
who now stands at death 's door .
a beautiful score from badalamenti 
exquisite photography of rural life
( love those aerial corn-field shot ) ,
and a sly director 's hand
that reveals man 's basic humanity ,
this is a beautiful slice of life film .
its extremely slow pace may lull some viewer to sleep ,
but those
who stay for along for the ride will
be well rewarded in the end .
