one of the worst romantic comedy
( nay 
worst movie )
i have ever seen .
boy
( who works as a phone psychic ! )
must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dream .
hilarity does not ensue .
boredom 
light gay-bashing 
and horrible dialogue do .
if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue ,
you will like this movie.be smart .
avoid this .
if you see it ,
destroy the copy .
