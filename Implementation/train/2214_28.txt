'i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain . '
this is an excell film .
it should have been re-rated to pg-13 .
but anyway 
prince 's first film and greatest .
the follow-up sucked .
but i have not seen for year so here is what i can remember about it .
the kid
( prince )
has to juggle with winning over the love of his life 
apollonia
( herself ) ,
keeping his band together
( the revolution as themselves )
and the tension in his family .
but his rival band
( the time as themselves )
is ruining his life .
like morris
( himself )
is trying to steal apollonia from the kid .
just like saturday night fever 
flashdance and 8 mile .
really good .
rent it 
laugh and cry
and if you luv it ,
buy it .
