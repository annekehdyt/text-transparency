*may contain spoilers* a few week
after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized
that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie .
which is why i decided i would do something
i
had never done before .
review the same movie again .
do not get me wrong ,
i still do not like the movie ,
i still think
it is dreck ,
and i still think
the zombie do not look all that zombie-ish .
the story in the movie is still in my opinion 
weak and rather lame .
the story is about a guy
named rick ,
who works as a scientist
( that just happens to be working on a serum thing
that heal sick cell 
in animal ) and his other germaine 
the two are not exactly on the best of term
( my my 
an original plot point )
and argue a lot .
one day germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting 
and rick calls up his scientist buddy to ing the serum
to try to resuscitate germaine
( whereas most person would 've called 911 
but whatever ) ,
naturally the serum fail and germaine `` dy ''
( if that did not happen
there 'd have been no movie ) 
after the police and the coroner
( until the end of time i will still think
that maybe the paramedic should have shown up )
leave the scene shows the coroner van
( which i still believe
was just someone 's van with a `` coroner '' decal
thrown on the side ) ,
and germaine returning to life to attack
and kill the paramedic .
i would talk more about the plot ,
but i feel
that if i reveal more about the story you would not want to watch it
( and we would not want that now would we ?
) ,
but suffice to say
that the story
( in my opinion at least ) meander
and is rather slow moving
( pun not intended ) .
as i have previously said
in my review the zombie do not look all that much like zombie ,
i still think
they look like
they have been in a bar fight .
that is not to say
that they should all be decaying and whatnot ,
but still there should at least be bite mark on the victim .
also i still do not like the fact
that the director
( s )
continually switch up the pace
at which the zombie move .
they could not really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombie run or shamble
( as most zombie movie do ) ,
do not get me wrong ,
i am all for running zombie
but make up your mind person .
in one scene the zombie runs toward the living ,
and in the other he just shambles to them .
and sometimes they just do not seem believable
( yes i know their fictitious creature but still ) ,
i am of course referring to the zombie
that runs his hand on the wall
as though he were walking through a dark living room ,
and i still do not like the zombie
who is lying on the ground ,
gets shot ,
then jerks like he was just shot .
the sound in the movie also bothered me 
mainly the music ,
which
while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent .
music in a movie is important folk .
especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder
and shot a little zombie flick .
the acting is still atrocious
( in my opinion )
and is on par with the american `` actor '' from the japanese zombie movie junk .
the movie is still bad 
almost house of the dead bad ,
it is better ,
no doubt about that ,
but then again
that is not saying much .
it is not the worst movie out there ,
and it is better than a lot of direct to video movie
that are out there
but at the end of the day was not good .
i also think
the movie moves really really slow ,
despite the fact
that it is only an hour and twenty or so minute
( and yes ,
i still do not like the opening song ) .
this is the type of movie
i
think is well-suited to be premiered on the sci-fi network .
which is why i am obligated
to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten .
but think of it this way ,
at least it is not a negative one .
