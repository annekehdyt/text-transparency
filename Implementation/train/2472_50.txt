there is so much
that can be said about this film .
it is not your typical nunploitation .
of course 
there is nudity and sex with nun ,
but that is almost incidental to the story.it is set in 15th century italy 
at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christian at otranto .
the battle between the muslim and the christian takes up a good part of the film .
it was interesting
when everyone was running from the muslim hoard ,
that the mother superior would ask ,
`` why do you fear the muslim 
;
they will not do anything
that the christian have done
to you ? ''
certainly 
there was enough torture on both sides.sister flavia
( florinda bolkan )
is sent to a convent for defying her father .
in the process 
she witnesses and endures many thing :
the gelding of a stallion 
the rape of a local woman by a new duke 
the torture of a nun
who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect ,
and a whipping herself
when she ran off with a jew .
the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax
being poured on the nun ,
and her nipple cut off.sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble
as she question the male-dominated society
in which she lives .
she even asks jesus ,
why the father 
son and holy ghost are all man.eventually ,
she joins the leader of the muslim as his lover
and they sack the convent .
here is where you see more flesh
than you can possible enjoy at one time .
but 
tragedy is to come .
she manages to exact sweet revenge on all ,
including the duke and her father ,
but finds
that the muslim lover treat her exactly the same .
she is a woman
and that is all there is to it.i will not describe what the holy man of the church did to this heretic at the end ,
but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades.nunploitation fan will be satisfied with the treat ,
but movie lover will find plenty of meat to digest .
