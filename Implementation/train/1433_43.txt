tale from the crypt :
and all through the house starts on christma eve as elizabeth
( mary ellen trainor )
kills her husband joseph
( marshall bell ) ,
she drags his body outside ready
to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio
that says a homicidal maniac
( larry drake )
dressed as santa clause
has escaped from a local mental asylum
and has already killed several woman with elizabeth next on his list
but she has other idea
and try to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage ... this tale from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 ,
directed by the one of the show 's regular executive producer robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch .
the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story
appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror '
and was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tale from the crypt
( 1972 )
which starred joan collin as the murderous wife character here
played by ellen trainor .
this particular version is good enough
but does not do anything different or special
and is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic .
at only 25 minute in length it certainly moves along at a good pace ,
the story is just about maca enough
and it generally provides decent entertainment and i quite liked the downbeat ending .
this time there are christma themed opening
and closing crypt keeper
( john kassir )
segments complete with the usual puns.director zemeckis does a good job
and there is a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christma influence as well .
there is not much gore here ,
someone has a poker stuck in their head ,
someone 's face is cut with an icicle ,
someone 's arm is cut with an axe
and there is some blood splatter
but generally speaking
it is not that graphic .
the acting by a small cast is pretty good.and all through the house is not the best tale from the crypt
but it is a decent one all the same ,
worth a watch
but after the comic book story and original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this ?
