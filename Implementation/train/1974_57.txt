everyone has a first love ,
and though it is hard to define
that feeling
when you are younger ,
it is there ,
aching inside you .
that is what malaysian filmmaker yasmin ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature 
a movie
where that most complex of emotion is recounted in a deceptively simple ,
straightforward fashion.such an approach is especially convenient in this case 
as the love story at the film 's core involves two twelve-year old ,
and would therefore make any attempt at `` deeper '' analysis seem contrived and pretentious .
that they do not is also testament to the astounding performance
given by the leading non-actor 
sharifah aryana and mohd syafie naswip .
the former play orked
( already seen as an adult character in ahmad 's previous picture 
gua ) 
a lively 
almost rebellious girl
who 
perhaps influenced by her `` british '' upinging
( her mother studied in england ) ,
despises playing with doll ,
preferring to play violent sport with the boy .
then one day she meets mukhsin
( naswip ) ,
who has come to spend the holiday at his aunt 's house ,
and all of a sudden she changes her habit :
goodbye fistfight 
hello bike-riding and tree-climbing .
but what does this mean ?
are they just friend ,
or is something more implied ,
something neither of them is yet ready to understand ,
let alone accept ?
given the young age of the protagonist ,
answering those question border on impossible 
and so 
like in several `` smaller '' film
( lost in translation comes to mind ) ,
there is no real closure 
a choice
that leaves a bittersweet ,
but ultimately satisfying aftertaste :
the naturalistic 
unfiltered acting
( especially aryana 's )
gets to the heart almost immediately 
and a strong supporting cast
( orked 's family most of all )
helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing .
the down-to-earth approach is not always that effective
( the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early ) ,
and it is hard to justify the bizarre pulp fiction reference at the start of the feature ,
but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough
to make this an interesting piece of independent asian cinema .
