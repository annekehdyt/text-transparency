i had the pleasure of screening `` the big bad swim '' at the 2006 new london film festival last week .
the festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream film from the past year .
it was my assumption
that `` the big bad swim '' was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason
that it was shot locally in and around eastern connecticut .
however ,
as the credit began to roll i
could only think about how well `` the big bad swim ''
compared to the other featured during the festival .
by far it topped my list ,
followed by `` the puffy chair '' ,
`` who killed the electric car '' and `` transamerica '' .the `` the big bad swim '' is an engaging 
truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupil and their likable
yet troubled instructor
that has a depth
that i have not seen on screen in quite a while .
the interweaving character development and plot line derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lesson work in subtle and endearing way
which i found refreshing .
the plot does not beat you over the head with a direction ;
rather it builds
and grows organically with a pace
that was spot on .
i was never bored .
i never cringed .
i never stepped out of the story on the screen.the humor of the film is something like `` napoleon dynamite '' meet `` old school '' .
the acting from a group of relatively unknown actor was credible
and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived .
obviously not being a multi-million production
the camera shot were not all awe-inspiring and clear 
but adequate and well done for the budget .
the lighting and filming technique for scene filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching
because of a more realistic approach
than a similar themed scene found in `` closer '' .
i also found shot filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulder up could be.i sure
it is said over and over from many in the independent film industry 
but i have to say it :
if `` the big bad swim '' is not picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed .
`` the big bad swim '' need to be seen .
if you have the chance to see this film ,
see it !
disappointment is impossible !
