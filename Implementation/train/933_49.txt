ivan
( marco ricca )
and gilberto
( alexandre borge )
are partner in a company
together with estev\u00e3o
( george freire ) ,
but the first one contract a professional killer 
anisio 
to murder estev\u00e3o
( the plot 
at least at the beginning 
does not explain very well why ) .
the guy does it
and after receiving his money
he starts blackmailing the two partner ,
appearing in their company
and saying
he wants a job there
( as supervisor or something ) .
at the same time he meets marina
( mariana ximene ) ,
daughter of estev\u00e3o ,
and starts dating with her !
in a story like this 
where crime 
corruption 
betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand ,
no one is innocent or can be victimized ,
exception made to marina ,
which is the only person
who does not know
what is going on
and did not betray anyone this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality
which exists in big metropoli like s\u00e3o paulo ,
where crime is every day 's presence .
we can feel irony
but also veracity in character like anisio
( illiantly
played by paulo miklos ) ,
which does blackmail to the guy
who paid him without any scruple ,
and even flirt with the daughter of the guy he killed !
he really must be a monster
to do something like that ,
but of course i know there 're person like him out there ,
in brazil or any other place it is a very good movie 
cruel but truthful 
about a sad reality the acting is great and the soundtrack too .
