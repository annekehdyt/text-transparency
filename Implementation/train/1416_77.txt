in this 'sequel ' bruce is still called billy lo
( get it ?
bruce= billy 
lo= lee .
no ? )
but apart from that ,
that is all
it has in common with the other movie .
billy does not seem to be an actor anymore .
he seems to be in another country .
he is more like a spy .
he is the only cast member to return and sadly ,
they kill him off to make way for a new character 
his other 
bobby .
sadly ,
when bruce dy 
the movie pretty much dy with him .
this was extremely poorly made .
it seemed like they were writing the script
as they were filming .
the footage works for a while
( it is not too obvious at first )
but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time
( he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason
to hide the fact
that it is not bruce
playing the part ) .
sadly
when he dy the movie change .
i can not help but wonder
if they were filming
as they were writing
and may well have planned
to keep bruce alive ,
but later decided to kill him off
because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead .
it is hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act
to follow
so it is hard to now accept bobby as the star .
bruce is never seen again in this movie .
i think
they should have made this sequel
without bruce he has a lame role in this movie .
person
hoping to see a new bruce lee movie
will be disappointed to see
that
although he is given the top billing ,
he only has a featuring role .
even the worst movie have at least one memorable bit .
if there was one bit about this movie person seem to talk about ,
it is the scene
where billy fight in a plant nursery .
ironically it does not even use bruce lee footage .
mind you 
they did it more convincingly in no retreat no surrender .
not one of the other actor here ever made anything else memorable .
bruce 's girlfriend
( colleen camp )
is never mentioned .
my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his other .
nothing else in the movie is worth watching .
i found
it really sad to see bruce die .
i do not see
how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money
to use footage from enter the dragon .
this was a cheap way
of trying to cash in on bruce 's name .
oddly this and the original are credited in bruce 's filmography .
thankfully so far 
no one has tried anything like this again .
1981 was the year of bruce 's last movie appearance .
it was a sad way to end it ,
but thankfully this is proof
that bruce 's movie career should be left alone .
