this is a low-budget `` scream '' style movie .
`` maddy '' is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office ,
where she meets
and starts a relationship with her co-worker `` chris '' .
during a hot tub-party 
chris and his friend convince maddy they belong to a `` murder club ''
where everyone has killed someone for kick .
when maddy loses it and kills someone for real ,
hijinks ensue.the film look good ,
and there are the requisite for this genre and budget level
( nudity 
gore 
maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger star than the cast ) ,
but 
after the credit roll 
you will ask yourself
why you spent 80 minute of your life
watching it .
