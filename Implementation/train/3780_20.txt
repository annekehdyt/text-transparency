is there anything worse than a comedy film
that lacks humor ?
the answer is yes ;
one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture .
the premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business -
but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay
and just does not work.was this considered a good 'b ' in 1942 ?
hard to imagine .
the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast ,
which contains several well-known faces from the '30 's and '40 's 
such as warren hymer 
vince barnett and robert armstrong
( i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling
who got gary cooper
killed in `` life of a bengal lancer '' ,
so i was not counting him )
.can not recommend this one
and gave it a rating of 3 -
if you have a choice ,
get a root canal .
