i love bad movie .
not only ,
because they often are as entertaining as 'really ' 'good ' film
( like pirate of the caribbean series and other hollywood pathos ) ,
but they often are far better than those film .
and that is the reason
why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s .
and that is the reason
why i especially love this movie ,
the barbarian and the company.director ruggero deodato has made some actually very good movie 
like house on the edge of the park ,
and also his atlantis interceptor and live like a cop ,
die like a man are enjoyable action movie .
but this is really bad .
the barbarian is so idiotic movie .
peter and david paul as the barbarian brother kutchek and gore are very funny ,
because of their lack of charisma and acting skill .
but if they can not act ,
they yell and scream every time they do something important .
in one scene person try to hang the barbarian brother ,
and they escape very extraordinary way.bad acting ,
bad special effect 
very stupid story 
bad direction ,
actually everything is bad in this movie .
i can not describe how much i laughed
when i watched this first time .
the barbarian and the company is camp classic everybody should see once .
if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp ,
this will be a real killer .
