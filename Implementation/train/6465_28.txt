whatever his name is
( the writer and director )
should be locked away in hope
garbage like this is never made again .
this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movie of all time .
sometimes movie are bad in a way
that they are actually sort of good .
not this one .
this was so bad i got angry .
seriously .
a drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script .
what a waste .
all the actor were completely uninspired to work at all ,
the cgi was barely acceptable ,
the sequence of scene were completely retarded
and hurt the little bit of story there was ,
it is like he just decided ,
`` i want this to happen and this to happen ,
but i do not care how we got there ,
just shoot it
and put it in .
whatever 
i am going back to my trailer to pick my nose ,
if anyone calls for me ,
i am not here . ''
shame on you
whatever your name is .
shame on you .
