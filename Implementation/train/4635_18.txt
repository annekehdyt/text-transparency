without `` mental anachronism '' 
this film
which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the person before the `` disenchantment of the world '' .
that 
there is thirty year ,
a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth
to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding .
it would be necessary
to be able to see
and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us
to make lose of capacity
to be included/understood ,
analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of `` primitive thought '' .
because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world
however contain certain key of our behavior ,
that only them future generation will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance .
if somebody knows
where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance .
