eathtaking 
this is without doubt
the best anime cartoon ever made .
i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80 as a child
and it left a lasting impression .
year
went by and i
forgot the title of the film ,
and only by chance owsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again .
after reading other people review and analysis i am not surprised it has such acclaim
and touched so many
because it does leave an impression .
a true fantasy adventure 
a must see for all child and adult .
its best not giving the story away
so i would say
watch this movie will a clear and open mind .
if you have kid treat them to this i promise
you they will love it .
there is not much to say about this piece of art
but if you have not seen it watch it and enjoy .
