the sitcom `` the league of gentleman '' follows the life of several bizarre inhabitant of the fictional village `` royston vasey '' .
the different scene are linked together by their common setting.in the first series 
a sketch show 
the main plot deal with a new road
which is going to be built through royston vasey .
consequently 
more foreigner visit the small town .
but edward and tubbs 
the owner of a `` local '' shop ,
which is actually far away from the town ,
do not like foreigner .
whenever a visitor enters their shop 
they kill him .
in my opinion some scene are kind of tasteless and not funny at all 
for example ,
when the couple absorb two engineer
who want to build the new road .
edward drum ,
while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victim .
moreover pauline life in royston vasey .
she works at the local job centre .
although pauline hates the person
she has to work with ,
the woman does not want to loose her job .
so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman ,
she does not allow him to go
because he is not ready for the job yet.then there is barbara dixton 
a transsexual taxi driver
who goes into great detail about `` her '' sexual conversion.furthermore the vet 
mr. chinnery ,
always kills animal instead of curing them .
in one case 
he comes to a farm
and is leaded into the sitting room ,
where a dog lays in his basket .
the farmer goes outside .
on the assumption
that the dog is the sick animal ,
mr. chinnery euthanizes him .
a second later 
the farmer opens the door ,
holding the `` real '' sick animal 
a sheep 
in his hand.some more inhabitant are a husband and his wife
who are visited by their nephew
( his friend is killed by the shop owner 
by the way ) .
the couple is very tidy .
they have 
for example 
towel in different colour .
each colour stands for one part of the body .
beside 
they have thousand of key ,
marked with different colour and precisely classified.in my opinion ,
the actor play very well .
by playing woman ,
the scene become comical .
the costume are suited to the actor 
too .
tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy character 
for example edward 
have unappetizing black teeth .
the show has a great deal of dark humour 
typical british .
the set design reflects the mood of the series .
the village and all the house look grey
and are decayed .
around the local shop there is often fog
which strengthens the threatening effect .
even the village sign is ominous :
`` welcome to royston vasey .
you will never leave .
`` although i think
that the actor do a great job ,
this type of series is not my taste .
