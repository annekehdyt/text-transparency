it starts slowly ,
showing the dreary life of the two housewife
who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april ,
but do not give up on it .
nothing much happen ,
but the time passes exquisitely 
and there are numerous sly joke
( my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm ,
which i find hilarious ) .
the movie is wonderfully romantic in many sense of the word ,
the scenery is beautiful
( as is polly walker ) ,
and the resolution in the movie are very satisfying.the movie takes a couple of liberty with the book ,
the biggest being with the arbuthnot/briggs/dester business ,
but i actually preferred the movie 's version of this
( it may be more sentimental ,
but i felt
that it was more consistent with the tone of the story ,
and anyway i like sentiment
when it is well done )
.an excellent movie 
especially as a date movie during lousy weather .
