well 
on the endless quest for horror 
we will come across this film ,
apparently re-released on dvd recently for some ungodly reason .
the transfer is awful and the quality just suck .
i do not think
this is due to a bad remaster or anything ,
i just think
the film is poorly done.obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget
that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks ,
`` slaughter high '' starts out slow
and does not pick up pace until about an hour in .
first 
we get to see a 'nerd '
as he is picked on by a group of ...
i actually do not even know
what they were supposed to be ... jock ?
the ringleader 
with his ultra hooknose is so ugly
he should have definitely been cast as the nerd .
then 
there is a 'big guy ' and a couple of dumb loser and chick
who are supposed to be 'hot '
but are not .
it is a mystery
why this group of reject is picking on one of their own ,
but i guess
the viewer is to assume these are 'cool kid ' picking on a dweeb .
the casting choice are horrendous
as most of the high schooler are played by thirty-something .
as other reviewer on here have pointed out 
the actor
( if you can call them that 
)
are a bunch of brit whose accent slip out numerous time throughout this piece of crap .
we are left to assume
that this group of 'child ' were the only student at this school ,
as their 'reunion ' is only them at the school ,
which is now shown to be abandoned ,
is just them.the kill are lame ,
the gore is not great
and the script is like scooby doo with real person ;
line like :
'this place gives me the creep ... '
and 'someone gim me a beer ' are highlight ...
it is just not good .
skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friend and wan na laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher .
if you wan na see good ,
get bava 's `` bay of blood 
''
done 14 year earlier and a heck of a lot better .
if you wan na see a good bad slasher ,
see `` just before dawn '' or `` the burning . ''
2/10 
kid .
