unfortunately for myself - i stumbled onto this show late
in it is lifetime .
i only caught a few episode
( about three )
before it was cancelled by abc .
i loved the character 
and storyline - but most of all the great actor !
i was a fan of sex and the city ,
so i saw two character i recognized
( bridget moynahan was and the character `` todd '' was `` smith jared '' ) ,
as well as jay hernandez
( from carlito 's way :
rise to power )
and erika christensen
( swimfan ) .
i enjoy watching young actor get their due ,
and felt like this show would propel their career further along .
i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd ,
and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime ?
in the meantime 
i am viewing it on abc 's website from the beginning .
