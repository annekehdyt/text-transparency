when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television .
we have all been guilty of it at some time or another 
but my excuse for watching thing like `` buck roger in the 25th century '' and `` silver spoon '' is this :
i was young and naive ;
ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.thankfully ,
i now appreciate the good stuff .
stargate sg-1 is not good .
the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it 
every line of stilted dialogue 
every bit of needless technobabble .
the writing is beyond insipid ;
so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek :
voyager .
if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever ,
you are in trouble.the film stargate
is a wonderful guilty pleasure 
anchored by two solid performance by jame spader and kurt russell 
full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture 
a wonderful musical score ,
and cool sci-fi idea .
with the exception of a little of the original music ,
none of what made the film fun appears in this show .
even richard dean anderson ,
who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting ,
seems like he is half asleep most episodes.the budget must have been very low
because the set sometimes look like somebody 's basement .
the cinematography is not much better 
as vanilla and dull as the script .
it amazes me
that shows with a lot more style
( like farscape )
and substance
( like the reimagined battlestar galactica )
have smaller 
less rabid fanbasis than this pap .
it just does not deserve it .
