the farrelly other 
bobby and peter 
are at it again .
with `` fever pitch '' the creator of other film
that have dealt with a lot of gross theme ,
abandon
that tactic
when they decided to ing nick hornby 's film to the screen ,
something
that it would have been hard to do .
the novel 
of the same title 
dealt with a man 's obsession with soccer ,
since it is set in england ,
where that sport consumes most of british sport fan .
it is to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell ,
to transform the book into a language
that would appeal to most american ,
when they make their hero 
a boston red sox fan .
`` fever pitch '' is a film
that presents an obsessive fan 
ben wrightly 
whose life revolves into the red sox season ,
and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny way
for involving his student into the subject
he tries to teach them .
when ben takes four of his best pupil for a tour of a local firm ,
he meets ,
and falls hopelessly in love with the ainy lindsey meeks 
a young woman
who is going place 
but at thirty 
has no life of her own.the story follows the two lover through the ritual of attending the red sox 
at home game 
in fenway park .
this team 's fan are probably the most loyal person in the world ,
having stuck with a team
that does marvelous thing but 
until 2004 
never won a world series .
in fact 
the ending 
from what we heard ,
had to be changed
because that was the year
in which they finally won the event
that had eluded them for eighty six year !
drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film .
ms. barrymore is a natural
who alway surprises in her appearance in front of the camera .
jimmy fallon 
a popular television comedian 
turned movie actor ,
has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in `` taxi '' ,
in our humble opinion.the farrelly other film will satisfy their fan as well as baseball fan with this baseball tale .
