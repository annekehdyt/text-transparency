an enthralling 
wonderful look at the film
that inspired the excellent martin scorsese .
many of the film he speaks of are easy to relate to his work 
particularly the earlier one 
the silent era .
very enjoyable despite being a bit long ,
i found this to be one of the best documentary on film yet .
required viewing
if you admire martin scorsese and his work .
