i am one of the million of columbo addict all over the world
and just watched this ,
the episode
that started it all ,
on british channel 5. it is fascinating to think
what sprung from this so-so movie and i can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of `` columbo ''
and added all the little touch
that make it such a marvellous and classic series .
that said ,
this particular movie is not as good as the rest
( except for the embarrassing final episode and the patronising british episode ) .
if columbo had been made as per the original 'pilot '
it certainly would not have gone on for very long 
or be watched and loved world-wide .
in this film lt columbo is smartly dressed ,
drives a normal car ,
has a partner ,
does not talk about his alleged relative
and comes across as quite aggressive .
there is also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between columbo and `` the villain '' .
watchable 
but only for the novelty of seeing how columbo started out .
