jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampire 
alien and the quest for immortality.the woman are beautiful and the photography stunning .
the dialog is inane .
its a laughable mess .
great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful .
i am trying to figure out
if we are suppose to be scared or not .
at the same time is it a put on or not ?
its an odd mix of art film and horror
that never quite mesh
and while its nice
to look at it
never seems to `` mean '' anything ,
and its by no mean scary
even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle .
something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those
who like naked woman .
