just saw the movie this past weekend ,
i am upset ,
and disappointed with it .
basically 
the movie tells you
that immigrant 
the one from former soviet union especially 
come to this country ,
ing everyone
they can with them from the old country ,
and invade and take over what american have been working for .
which is a very wrong way
of looking at immigration ,
and a much worse way of telling person about it .
that is the main thing .
another thing 
the overall writing 
directing and filming is on the level of village amateur .
the actor did pretty well ,
but it was not up to them save this bunch of crap .
a few joke were funny ,
but most were bad and cheesy .
could not wait to get out of the theater ,
want my money back .
