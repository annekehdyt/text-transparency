how sad there is no option to post a mark lower
than 1. i watched this piece of nonsense
and could barely believe
what i was watching .
every single part of the film was awful .
music 
acting 
direction 
story 
everything 
simply everything .
i actually found myself laughing out loud at various point in the film .
i particularly loved the bit
where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion ,
and knocks the clipboard out of the nurse hand ,
because 
... ... ... ... .well .
just because .
product placement ?
crucifix 's ( crucifi ? )
everywhere .
if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied ,
you may like this movie .
if you do like this movie ,
you really need to get out more .
