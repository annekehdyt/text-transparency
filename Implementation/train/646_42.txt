i watched dvd 1 only .
the program proper may have 10 minute of good information ;
otherwise it is snotty putdown of religious person .
it is as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm ,
and feel with these tool he can easily bludgeon his opposition.also 
flemming wander extensively into his own personal issue ,
and they take over the movie .
it never gets back on topic.religious person
are prone to discount skeptic
when their objection to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upinging .
argument from such victimized person seem irrational ,
and therefore unconvincing.anti-religious person will want more datum .
we do not need to be told
that religious person are nutty ,
any more than american jew need to be told
how annoying christmas music gets by mid-december.in the best scene 
the superintendent of fleming 's childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivation .
that seems like the most honest part of the movie ,
and it was too short.if fleming were a bit more self-aware ,
he might have a good story
in him about his own
( past and current )
relationship to christianity 
and the abusive institution
that indoctrinated him in his youth.and perhaps
he could lend his `` christ never walked the earth '' material to a more serious documentarian .
i am not studying the writing of saul/paul
to find out
how air-tight this all is ,
but a quick owse of wikipedia suggests
most of these argument are discredited.the bonus interview
are pretty good ,
tho
they do not bolster fleming 's thesis much .
sam harris is a good spokesperson for the anti-religious pov ,
and he does not go light on those other 
non-christian religion .
harris also has some good
( and easily google 'd )
interview on salon.com 
amazon.com 
and samharris.org .
