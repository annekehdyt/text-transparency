with a story and screenplay
that seems to have been written by a high schooler 
'the art of seduction ' fail
to deliver the romantic 
sophisticated experience
it tries to bill itself as .
the two main character have the potential
to be interesting -
both male and female lead are `` swinging single
( or in the female lead 's case ,
engaged ) '' ,
but 'the art of seduction ' does not even try .
shirking from a frank examination of these two character ' personality 
'the art of seduction ' eschew anything of substance for a basis of thin 
lean stereotype .
'the art of seduction ' is insulting - insulting to its character 
insulting to man and woman 
and insulting to its audience ' expectation .
it takes the awful beautiful person
we all know
and plays out their painful interaction
while expecting us to idolize them .
ji-wan is an immature 
spoiled 
manipulative bitch .
the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaw
because she is pretty .
min-jun 
well 
he is exactly the same .
neither are nice person .
the `` humour '' in this film primarily revolve around ji-wan and min-jun 's outlandish attempt at outdoing each other in the honourable art
of lying and manipulation .
no character developmant occurs ,
and we never learn
why ji-wan and min-jun are like this .
we are simply expected to take them as
they are ,
and not ask question - they are cute ! ,
and that is all that matter .
the copious reference to the celeity of the main actor in azn cinema scenester 's review may tip you off to 'art of seduction 's shallowness .
if you are still in high school ,
you liked grease ,
or you are a yellow fever victim ,
you may like this movie.despite its `` romance '' tag ,
this is not a very good date movie .
