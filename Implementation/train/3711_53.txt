this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie 
and quite true to my own experience of bulimia .
it was actually well-researched ,
and i can only assume
it was written by someone
who 's gone through a similar experience ,
because it had all the little detail .
the character were quite well-drawn ,
and the performance by mare winningham and alison lohman were great .
i think
what i like most was that they made them specific and smart ,
and there was no dumbing down of the reason for beth 's bulimia
( it was not some `` diet gone out of control ,
caused by the pressure
placed on girl by the medium ,
pressure we are not actually going to address ... '' ) .
her mother was not completely clueless - too often on television they will take an issue
that everyone has some awareness of and try to tell us
that their protagonist are the last remaining person on earth
who do not
( `` diabetes ?
what is that ?
oh 
my world is all askew 
doctor ,
please explain
it all to me
as if i am a small child '' 
etc ) .
it was illiant
that her mother was a psychologist and
even she did not see the sign .
and the scene
where beth was throwing up
were not overly melodramatic and sensationalist 
and concentrated more on bulimic ' need for secrecy 
and their out-of-controlness .
the scene
where beth tells her mother
she is bulimic would 've made me cry
if there had not been other person in the room.okay ,
so i liked those bit .
what did not work for me so well was the ending ,
which headed back to the tv movie territory
we know and do not particularly love ,
but i guess they had to wrap it up .
`` you 
too 
can cure your child 's eating disorder ,
if you have lot and lot of money and live in america ... ''
and can i just say again
that i really like mare winningham .
she is great .
