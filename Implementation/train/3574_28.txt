i was looking for a cute 
simple comedy
to pass the time
but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake.i can
not write a single good thing about it .
first 
the script is stupid and not funny at all 
relying on tired 
recycled joke and a farting turtle for laugh .
in my book ,
that is not funny ,
that is pathetic.low budget 'effect '
( if i can even call them effect )
with horrible cinematography .
in many place it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money.acting ...
i feel sorry for the actor .
are pamela anderson and denise richard
that desperate for some money
that they have agreed to take part in this ?
( looking at their recent filmography ,
it would appear so . )
despite the outfit ,
pamela is showing her age
and as a whole ,
they do not even come across as sexy ,
let alone funny.this movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category .
it is just bad ,
as if everybody involved was sick of it.avoid .
