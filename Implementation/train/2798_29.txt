`` the fallen one '' fall under the waste of life
( wol )
category .
i am sad
that i am now two hour older was not entertained .
my other family member also watched this movie
and threw demeaning comment at the screen
and rooted for the mummy .
i felt sorry for the actor
( wagner ) .
i have read other negative review
and can not add anything else to this movie other
than it could be reduced to 25 minute
so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv
without any loss of plot .
it reminds me of a dish
that has several good ingredient
but when served is bland with no flavor at all .
in my humble opinion 
the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 foot
and improved the plot
by taking out the mystic
and replacing him with several person
who want to denigh the fact
and want dna sample for evil reason .
the hero are discredited
and tossed on there ear by their college .
later after everything was screwed up by the evil person .
the hero would save the day and prove everyone wrong .
