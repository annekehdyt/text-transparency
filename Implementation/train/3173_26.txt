sorry .
someone has to say it .
this really is/was a dull movie .
worthy perhaps 
but dull nonetheless .
i nearly cried with boredom
when watching it .
the acting is pretty dire ,
the story drawn out and predictable 
the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting .
it is one of those movie
you are not allowed to hate
( becase it is about disabled person )
but hate
it i suspect nearly everyone does .
it is interesting that critic have been so kind to this movie .
i suppose
they too
are
not allowed to be objective .
this was made to win award -
which i remember
it duly did .
but it was neither interesting nor entertaining .
i have not seen the play
so can not compare .
