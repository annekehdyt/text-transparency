the only thing about this film
that bums me out
is that the dvd is so expensive .
it is too much for my budget at the moment ,
or i would purchase it ,
because the film is a good example of film noir ...
and i enjoy watching richard widmark 
jean peter and thelma ritter.criterion produces great dvds
but sometime the asking price is just a bit much .
that is the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white ,
mono sound film
that is good but nothing extraordinary ,
cinematography-wise.the story is the story here
( as opposed to visual 
actor 
sound 
set 
etc . )
as a pickpocket
( widmark )
inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peter ' purse .
( say that three time ! ) .
everyone but peter is a believable character in this movie :
widmark 
the cop 
the u.s. agent and the communist and 
especially ritter as `` moe 
'' an informant .
she and widmark are the star of this film.peter does a decent job
of playing the cheap floozy
but loses her credibility early on by `` falling in love '' with widmark on the first meeting
even though he is nasty to her .
only in world of film ! !
too bad ,
because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.this an average film noir
which means good ,
but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35 .
for that price 
one could do a lot better in the film noir market .
