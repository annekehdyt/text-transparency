as a fan of paris je'taime 
i went to see new york ,
i love you with very high expectation .
i gladly walked out with all my expectation met .
it was funny 
sweet 
fast-paced 
and entertaining .
the film starts out with two cab hopper
( bradley cooper and justin bartha )
trying to get to the same area
but arguing
which way to go .
that was funny ,
and then the film goes into some of the best skit i have ever seen anywhere .
there were four amazing one out of all the good one .
those four i will start talking about .
one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel
who finds love in an old lady .
the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker
who is doing business with a woman
played by christina ricci .
another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly
as two person going to prom ,
thirbly 's character being handicapped .
the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple .
i will ing to your attention
that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing ,
and writing a skit about a caretaker ,
and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker .
new york 
i love you is definitely as good 
if not better than the 2006 paris je'taime .
the skit are well-paced ,
and the film shows
how indie film should really be .
the film 
however 
does not have as many famous director as paris je'taime ,
which is why
it was fantastic to live up to its excellence .
if you want to laugh ,
see some great dramatic effect ,
see an amazing amount of great performance ,
and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york 
i love you .
