avoid this crap at all cost .
bad script 
bad directing 
bad acting 
bad editing 
bad sound 
and bad music .
get the idea ?
this movie tries to be western flavored ,
it is not .
it tries to be hard core violent ,
it is not .
it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre ,
it does not .
the actor try there best ,
and my heart goes out to them .
but with such inane material to work
with it is hard to make something shine .
to me this has all of the look of a `` fresh outta film school gon na set the world on fire '' first attempt .
freshman film maker often bite off more
that they 
or their budget 
can chew .
the best thing
they can do
is to take a few step back ,
reassess what is possible ,
and work within their limited budget the next time out .
