strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark ,
so i had to wait for the video release .
my expectation where high but they where in no way disappointed .
as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting 
an intelligent and thrilling plot
that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming .
along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best western of the 90`s.people
who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot
( corny )
or braveheart
( acceptable )
will be sourly disappointed ,
all other
who appreciate the above mentioned quality
will have a fantastic time
watching it .
9/10 .
