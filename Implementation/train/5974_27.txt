in the rapid economic development of 1990 's in china 
there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture ,
partially due to the rise of nationalism
accompanied by the increase in wealth 
and more importantly 
due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era.however 
the resurgence of chinese traditional culture 
namely 
the confucianism 
was not without disaster ,
because chinese are adopted the entire tradition
without eliminating the bad part ,
and the discrimination against girl
demonstrated in this film
is an excellent example.moreover 
not only the part
that should be discarded
were inherited 
the good part
that was supposed to be inherited 
such as the traditional opera 
and its technique ,
such as changing face ,
was ignored in the resurgence ,
and facing extinction.the director used this film
to criticize the problem of re-emacing tradition by contemporary china
and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .
