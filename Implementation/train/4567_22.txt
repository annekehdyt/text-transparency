no string attached feature carlos mencia doing stand-up
that makes us both laugh and think .
not only does he poke fun at racial issue
( like many hater claim ) ,
but he also talks about the best way
to get illegal immigrant out of the country ... what woman
mean
when they say
they want to be treated equally ... why american are crazier than arab terrorist ... why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes
he is doing in heaven ... a theory of how easter
( aka big up to jesus day )
tradition got started ... his viewing of the movie passion of the christ - and his sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he is affected by jesus ...
how society should treat the physically handicapped ...
and even if you have the right
to tell a joke or not.also ,
he never stops reminding us
that each of us has a voice .
so we should use it to speak the truth ,
say
what we think ,
and not be afraid
if other are offended.carlos is the bomb .
