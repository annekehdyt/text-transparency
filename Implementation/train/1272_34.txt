this is a great film for mccartney 's and beatle fan !
a splendid time is guaranteed for all.the audience
( feat some celeity such as nicholson 
cuzak 
michael douglas )
is 
as always 
quite amazing :
from small child to old campaigner of the sixties.they know
the word to all the song by heart ,
and some of them are crying
when paul eaks into `` blackbird '' `` yesterday `` `` all my loving '' and all the treasure of his catalog
( who 
except john lennon and dylan ,
can claim such a repertoire ?
) .there are two particularly moving moment :
-the double tribute to lennon and harrison ;
first `` here today '' performed solo
( the title was included in `` tug of war '' 1982
and was its best track ) ,
then `` something ''
when paul uses an ukulele.- '' the long and winding road '' rendition 
a key moment 
when paul 's voice crack 
as he is moved to tear by the heart the member of the tour crew hold in front of the stage.i remember 
in the early seventy ,
when person used to despise paul ,
cause he was not involved in politic ,
as his ex-partner was.they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist :
`` fame is great cause
it allows charity ''
.the film show different aspect of paul 's activity 
an artist
who is anything but selfish .
