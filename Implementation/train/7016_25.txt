first of all 
i loved bruce broughton 's music score 
very lyrical ,
and this alone added to the film 's charm .
the best aspect of the movie were the three animal ,
superlatively voiced by michael j.fox 
sally field and the late don ameche .
wherea fox has the funniest line ,
ameche plays a rather ooding otherwise engaging character
( the voice of reason ) ,
and field adds wit into a character
that is always seen telling chance off .
the human were not as engaging ,
and sometimes the film dragged ,
but that is my only complaint .
this is one beautiful-looking film ,
with beautiful close up shot of canada ,
i believe .
although the film itself is quite long ,
there is never a seriously dull moment ,
and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script .
all in all 
a charming and perhaps underrated film 
with a 9/10 from me .
