well ,
if you like pop/punk 
punk 
ska 
and a tad bit of modern psycho billy ,
then seeing
the live performance are about the only thing worth watching .
this movie has ton and ton of band cameos 
along with president of troma 
lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role 
and lot of goofy death scene .
sound like it may be good 
right ?
well 
the death keep coming ,
and repeatedly to many different band of the warp tour and the fan at the event .
some of the death start of stylish ,
but then they are recycled over and over 
to the point of being completely repetitive .
almost everyone dy
of having their head smashed ,
or intestine being pulled from their stomach .
the gore looks
as if it was from andreas schnaas ' `` zombie 90 :
extreme pestilence '' ;
with this being the `` watered-down type blood '' ,
but now that movie is actually decent ,
and provides humor-something
that this movie terribly lacks .
sure 
the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma ,
it is got great low-budget potential ,
and it try ...
but just too hard .
everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie ,
and thats what ings it down .
everything try to be too comic and goofy ,
by using intentional bad acting 
an overuse of pointless death ,
and doing the same thing ... over and over .
it is basically `` mulva :
zombie ass-kicker '' 
`` chairman of the board '' 
or any movie
you have made with your friend :
it is funny to those
who made it ,
and that is about it.great potential 
great idea 
great use of effects-but
it is the same thing ... over and over :
a band plays 
a band dy 
fan die .
everyone dy 
blood is sprayed everywhere ,
the process is repeated.the question is for these type of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do
they try too hard 
or not at all ?
