this program is a lot of fun
and the title song is so catchy i can not get it out of my head .
i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinkly
who get thing done ,
and these four are excellent in their endeavor .
some of what they do is outrageous but illiant considering that now day with our pc world we 'd never be able to do it in real life .
i always learn something from the show .
but if you like mystery 
drama 
comedy ,
and a little forensic work
you will love this show .
it reminds me of quincy 
me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other .
they screw up a lot
but they get the job done ,
and that is what counts .
