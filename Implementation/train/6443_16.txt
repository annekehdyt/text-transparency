yet another example of what british cinema can achieve :
a simple story 
told and acted well .
brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ,
ably assisted by a solid supporting cast .
the `` quirky small town '' card gets played to the hilt 
similar to many tv series and film
that have come from the british isle in recent year
( ballykissangel 
hamish macbeth and other come to mind ) .
like the forementioned 
this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery ,
in this case the wet and wild cornish coast.some viewer might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging ,
other might find the ending just a little too cute and safe .
but it is an enjoyable spliff ,
to be sure .
