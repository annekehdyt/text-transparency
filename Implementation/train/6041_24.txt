i suck at gratuitous boob reference ,
so i am just going to write a plainly flat
( no pun intended )
review .
i love elvira 
not in a `` i am-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical '' way ,
but suffice to say
i think
she rocks .
the movie is played like a 50 's horror film only alot more fun 
look for the `` leasurely stroking of the ankle '' reference
to know what i mean .
what relay shines through in the movie is elvira 's
( or should that be cassandras )
absolute charm .
i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 ,
and have seen
it contless time since.. i realy should get around
to buying a copy ,
the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear .
if any other fan of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free.p.s another great performance from edie mcclurg
( chastedy pariah )
an actress
who never gets the attention she deserves .
