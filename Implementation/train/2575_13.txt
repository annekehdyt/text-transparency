i did not expect much
when i first saw the dvd cover .
i mean 
pierce brosnan as grey owl ?
? ah ...
but then the story got underway 
unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film .
i was surprised and delighted at this
( basically ) true story .
made me want to read more about this fascinating character ,
which means ,
the director fulfilled his purpose ,
and the film was a success !
