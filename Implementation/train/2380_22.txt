... and i have seen
some bad ones.i have nothing good to say about this movie .
the acting is poor by jennifer tilly -
as to be expected .
daryl hannah does an ok job ,
but nothing close
to being able to save this movie.the biggest flaw in this film
is that the plot is so weak -
though based on a good premise -
that the writer resorted to the `` stupid heroine trick ''
to create a contrived suspense .
when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide ,
she runs out in front of her pursuer .
the hospital scene is absurd .
without exposing too much of what passes for a plot ,
i think
it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman
to carry a pregnant from a hospital
without being noticed .
lame .
very lame.save yourself some time
and pick out another flick .
