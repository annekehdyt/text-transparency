i do not know
how this movie received so many positive review on this site !
i am a big vonnegut fan
and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief ,
but even if i was not ,
the poor acting 
very poor casting
( sean astin as the illiant 
athletic ,
and all around individual 
harrison ? ?
the guy 's completely generic ! )
and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable .
someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was .
if you read
that
and thought
that was pure comic illiance
( sadly ,
it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie ) ,
maybe you will like this movie .
but if you are a vonnegut fan or not completely insane ,
do not see it .
please .
