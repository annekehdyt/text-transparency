for those who are too young
to know this or for those
who have forgotten ,
the disney company went almost down the tube by the end of the 1980s .
person were not seeing their movie anymore
and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material ... .at least no what person expected .
a major problem : profanity.yes 
the idiot running the disney movie during
that decade would produce film with swear word -
including the lord 's name in vain ,
if you can believe
that - interspersed in these `` family film . ''
in fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minute !
this movie 
in addition to the language problem 
has a nasty tone to it 
too ,
which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning .
thankfully 
disney woke up
and has produced a lot of great material
since these decadent '80s movie .
( `` touchstone '' is disney ,
just under another name . )
