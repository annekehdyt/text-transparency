oh dear .
while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new high with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level .
fortunately chevy is barely in this at all
and can not be blamed for this utter tripe .
it seriously is very 
very bad .
while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time
of it is release
( 1974 )
it still remains neither funny or acutely observed .
the sketch are all way
too long and any satirical impact
they may
have had is lost
as they are all drawn out to the point of complete boredom .
this is credited as chevy 's movie debut and i am pleased to say
that everything he did after this bettered it .
avoid even if curious .
