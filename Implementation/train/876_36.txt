i definitely recommend reading the book prior
to watching the film .
this book won national book council award in 1978
and is a very gripping read
( pun not intended ) .
it is not too difficult to read for those out there
that do not read often so do
not be afraid !
the book seems to capture the passion of the relationship
more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense
after reading the book .
having grown up in melbourne i
could really relate to this book and movie .
very few australian female writer were around the in the 70 's therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a woman in an urban city in australia during this era or class .
it is a precious piece of melbourne history .
it is a shame
that it is documented as some sort of 80 's soft porn movie .
it is far from that
and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket ,
it does not represent what the movie is about at all .
those
that rent the movie
based on this description
will only be disappointed .
just remember this movie was made in 1982 ,
so do not expect the hollywood over dramatization
that they seem to incorporate these day .
this is what i like about it .
it is also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role ,
she is just fantastic as nora
and it is great watching her really acting ,
for if you are close to my age
you will best remember her for her stint on playschool and better home and garden .
who knew she hid this talent ?
this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her .
a classic australian story !
