i have seen this film more than once now ,
and there is always someone complaining about the `` obvious construction '' of the plot afterward .
but then - this is part of petzold 's game :
he plays along with the rule of genre.it is very nice ,
how the highly improbable story
of how the two girl
( timoteo/hummer )
meet 
is again mirrored in another 
even more improbable story ,
that the girl make up for a casting .
this film is a journey between fact and fiction ,
it is more about potential ,
thing
that might have happened in the past
or might be happening in the future ,
than it is about actual ongoing .
it is a reverie 
sort of -
so apt enough there are a lot of motive ,
freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis 
like all the `` doppelganger '' -constellation .
also ,
i think ,
`` gespenster '' might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny :
petzold 's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive 
strangely familiar way .
this film is not about the obvious .
to describe it as the story of two girl
who meet
and eventually become friend and lover 
or as the story of an orphaned mother ,
who searches europe for her lost daughter ,
clearly does not say much about the nature of `` gespenster '' at all .
