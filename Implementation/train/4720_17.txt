what an appalling film .
do not get me wrong ,
gene hackman and denzel washington are good actor ,
but aside from a few interesting set piece 
the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariner shouting 
crying 
sweating and generally freaking out
when anything goes wrong.take
that with simplistic aside
to make sure
the audience still understand
what is going on ( the scene
where denzel washington explains to a radio repairman
how he must be like scotty in star trek
is nothing more than a joke )
and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting.let us just hope
that the real nuclear us navy is not in the hand of such a script !
