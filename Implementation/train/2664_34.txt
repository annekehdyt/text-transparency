i had the pleasure
of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival .
this film had caught my attention a little while back
when i stumbled across an article
about it in jalouse magazine .
seemed interesting at the time ,
but nothing too exciting .
anyhow 
i saw it on the festival program
and decided to check it out .
all i can say
is that i was speechless
when the ending credit began to roll .
this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing film
that i have seen in some time .
the photography 
art direction 
acting 
and especially directing 
were seamless and impeccable .
nothing is 'spelled out ' for you in this film
and actually makes you think .
something
that a vast majority of film today do the exact opposite .
the dialogue is carefully crafted and ,
although this script is not wall to wall chatter ,
the character word are very deliberate
and meaningful.it is definitely one of those film
that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it ,
the more thing you notice .
it is a very layered and intelligent film .
not sure
when or where it is playing again ,
but a definite must see for film enthusiast .
