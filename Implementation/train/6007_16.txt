iberia is nice to see on tv .
but why see this in silver screen ?
lot of dance and music .
if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie .
but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time .
if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen
it is better to see bollywood movie .
they know
how to combine eath taking dancing to long movie .
director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience .
and time to time it is look really good .
but when the movie is one and hour
it should be at least most of time interesting .
there are many kind of art
not everything is bigger then life
and this film is not too big .
