what a stunning episode for this fine series .
this is television excellence at its best .
the story takes place in 1968
and it is beautifully filmed in black and white 
almost a film noir style with its deep shadow and stark image .
this is a story about two man
who fall in love ,
but i do not want to spoil this .
it is a rare presentation of what homosexual faced in the 1960 in america .
written by the superb tom pettit ,
and directed by the great jeannot szwarc 
we move through their life ,
their love for each other 
and their tragedy .
taking on such a sensitive issue
makes this episode all the more stunning .
our emotion are as torn and on edge as the character .
chill ran up my spine at the end
when they played bob dylan 's gorgeous 
`` ah ,
but i was so much older then ,
i am younger than that now 
''
as sung by the byrd .
this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the star .
beautiful .
