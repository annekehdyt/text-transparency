we really enjoyed grey owl :
a simple tale well told in classic attenborough fashion :
a little over-romanticized 
with archetype 
humor 
and a stress of dignity and values.beautifully shot
and told at a nice pace this is the true story of archie 
an englishman
who turned native indian ,
and went to live
and trap in canada.solid performance from all makes this film with a message easy viewing.two of the star of the film are without a doubt
the cutest
we have ever seen -
and the message is a good one with its ecoleaning .
it must have been great to meet or read grey owl in the 1930s ,
a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute .
