a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era .
obviously 
it was first conceived into this world for the stage ,
but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end .
peter o'toole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen
and both do it effectively .
there is very little in the way of story
and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it .
all in all 
though 
a good film
in which peter o'toole and susannah york get to overact .
