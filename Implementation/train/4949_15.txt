i waited age
before seeing this as all the review i read of this said
it was horrible !
i rented
it expecting the worst ,
and
while it is hardly the best sandler film out there ,
there are much worse !
sandler frequently talks to the camera
and the film does not take itself seriously ,
but that is all part of the fun !
a great way to waste an afternoon ,
and you might even find yourself laughing once a twice !
a good film 
well worth renting !
