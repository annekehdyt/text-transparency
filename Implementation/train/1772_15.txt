i loved this movie !
i am biased
seeing as i am a huge disney fan ,
but i really enjoyed myself .
the action takes off running in the beginning of the film
and just keeps going !
this is a bit of a departure for disney ,
they do not spend quite as much time on character development
( my husband pointed this out )
and there are no musical number .
it is strictly action adventure .
i thoroughly enjoyed it
and recommend it to anyone
who loves disney ,
be they young or old .
