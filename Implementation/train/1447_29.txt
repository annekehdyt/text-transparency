this is the best mob film ever made .
it deserved more then what it got at the oscar .
nominated for thing like its score 
art direction ,
supporting role
( newman ) ,
this film could have easily been nominated for best picture 
director
( mende ) 
actor
( hank ) ,
supporting actor
( newman and law )
and won ! !
hank gives one of his best performance ,
and the kid
who played michel jr.
was so good
that
i am surprised
i do not see him in more movie today .
critic themselves did not give this film enough credit .
but besides the incredible performance ,
another real star of this film is the incredible music .
this was by far the best score of the year .
it was nominated but did not win .
this is a great film
that should be seen by everyone .
my grade-a+
