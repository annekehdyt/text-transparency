nbc mini-series
( later released to video/dvd as full length feature film )
about the treacherous 1960 ,
as seen through the eye of both a white family and a black family .
the film 's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the family .
however 
dutton 's character is killed halfway
through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull 
incoherent 
and downright awful 2nd half .
rating :
4/10 .
not rated
( later rated pg-13 for video/dvd release ) .
