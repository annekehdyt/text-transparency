this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan ,
some might think
that it is a little over the top ,
and that it is only about ringo and marc 's egos ,
but i think
it is similar to any other concert video ,
except for the fact
that this is marc bolan ,
not just any guy !
i especially liked the music video for child of the revolution 
with elton john and ringo starr .
this clip alone is worth all the money ,
i can not believe
they did'not release this version as the single .
the movie is really superb 
especially for us dane .
now 
i was not alive during the 70 's .
but dane in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them .
the medium did not play or show any of the popular music back then ,
including marc bolan and t.rex ,
they only played a little with the door ,
only the really popular song though .
so 
i know from my dad ,
that seeing this ,
gives him back a part of his youth ,
he never got to experience.i wont make this too long ,
so ...
if you are the least bit fan of marc bolan ,
you need to see this .
you might find it boring or as said before 
a little over the top .
but at least you have seen one of the best musician ever ,
in action ! only thing
that disappoints me a little ,
is that ride a white swan is not on the tape .
but i forgive it 
since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played .
