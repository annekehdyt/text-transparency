this romantic comedy is not too bad .
there are some funny thing happening here and there ,
and there are some rather memorable character in it.the acting 
however 
is amateurish
( with the exception of the banker ) .
while some scene are great fun ,
other are simply embarrassing .
in particular 
i found the `` romantic '' part of the story poor .
all in all 
i guess
it is worth seeing
if you like football and romantic comedy .
it is not really a bad movie ,
and the ending did feel quite good .
just do not expect anything out of the ordinary .
fair enough
if you have an hour and a quarter
to kill .
