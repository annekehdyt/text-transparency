not the greatest film
to remember paul naschy by.gaston
( guillermo bredeston )
is probably the worst swordsman i have ever seen .
zorro would be ashamed !
his only salvation came
as the competition was just
as bad.this film is described as adventure and horror .
forget the horror - there is none .
no nudity 
no blood 
no monster ; just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron
( paul naschy )
who wants to be king.the main feature of the film
was seeing graciela nilson ,
who only made four film in two year
and disappeared to our regrettable loss .
where did she go ?
