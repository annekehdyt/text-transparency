one thing about hollywood 
someone has a success
and it is always rushed to be copied .
and another thing is that player give some of their best performance away from their home studio.rock hudson got such accolade for his performance in the texas based film giant
that universal executive must have thought ,
let 's quick get him into another modern texas setting.similarly robert stack got great review for the high and the mighty as the pilot
who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft
that it was natural
to give him another crack up role.both of these end
were achieved in written on the wind .
before hudson was the big ranch owner ,
now he is the son of a hunting companion of robert stack 's father
who took hudson under his wing .
in other word the jame dean part
without the jame dean racism from giant .
lauren bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency
that stack 's hadley oil company uses .
hudson likes her ,
but she is dazzled by stack 's million
and when he woos a girl
he is got the mean
to really pursue a campaign .
she marries stack.and last but not least in the mix we have dorothy malone
who 's stack 's amoral sister
who has a yen for rock ,
but rock are not about to get tangled up with this wild child .
dorothy malone spent over 10 year in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine role before landing this gem .
she got a best
supporting actress award for her part as marilee hadley
and it was well deserved.if you like splashy technicolor fifty soap opera
than this is the film for you .
