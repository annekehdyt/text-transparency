this is a typical steele novel production in that two person
who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage
to get together
despite the odd .
i would not call this a spoiler
because anyone
who has read a steele novel
knows
how they all end .
if you do not want to know much about the plot ,
do not keep reading.gilbert 's character 
ophelia 
is a woman of french decent
who has lost her husband and son in an accident .
gilbert need to stop doing film
where she is required to have an accent
because she 
otherwise a good actress 
can not realistically pull off any kind of accent .
brad johnson 
also an excellent actor 
is matt ,
who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce .
he is gentle 
convincing and compelling in this role.the two meet on the beach through her daughter 
pip ,
and initially 
ophelia accuse matt of being a child molester
just because he talked art with the kid .
all of them become friend after this episode
and then the couple falls in love.the chemistry between the two lead is not great ,
even though the talent of these two person is not 
in my opinion 
a question .
they did the best
they could with a predictable plot and a script
that border on stereotypical .
two person meet 
tragedy 
bigger tragedy 
a secret is revealed 
another tragedy ,
and then they get together .
i wish
there was more to it than that ,
but there it is in a nutshell.i wanted mindless entertainment ,
and i got it with this .
in regard to the genre of romantic film ,
this one fails to be memorable .
`` a secret affair '' with janine turner is far superior
( not a steele book ) ,
as are some of steele 's earlier book turned into film .
