i have no idea
what idiots gave this movie a palm d'or at the 1999 canne film festival
because it was atrocious !
i actually watched the entire thing
simply because i could not believe
that someone would make such a worthless film .
there is nothing interesting about the plot ,
the character are devoid of depth
and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effect .
also ,
if you do decide to waste 2 hour of your life by watching this film ,
be sure to ing something to throw up
in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time
you can not even see the main subject .
this style has been used much more successfully in movie such as `` blair witch ''
because it creates suspense .
in rosetta 
there is no plot and no suspense
to which that style would lend anything .
i should have known better
when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning
that it was going to be horrible .
