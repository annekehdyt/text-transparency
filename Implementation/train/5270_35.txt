a have a female friend
who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob
who has a long term girlfriend .
of course the sob is very good-looking 
charming ,
etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman .
watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life
when guy like that destroy the life of our female friend .
it is tragic ,
and you know
she is going to end up very hurt ,
but there is nothing
you can do .
leaud is illiant .
totally empty .
a blank throughout 
he pulls the faces
and tells the story
he thinks
will get the reaction
he wants.the scene two hour
in when leaud and leun have made love ,
and the next morning he puts on a record and 
very sweetly and charmingly ,
sing along
to amuse her is illiant .
the `` what the hell am i doing here with this idiot ''
expression
that flicker back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time
to come.it is a long film ,
but see it in one go 
preferably in a cinema .
takes a
while to get into ,
but then the time just disappear .
