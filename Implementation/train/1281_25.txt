we could still use black adder even today .
imagine rowan atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister
played by the wonderful hugh laurie .
hugh is sensational as the dimwit prince george and edmund as his illiant assistant .
i love the episode
which kenneth connor guest star as a british thespian .
every time ,
edmund says macbeth .
the two thespian do a silly little act to ward off evil spirit .
it is the funniest thing
that you will see .
of course 
none of this illiance and comedic genius could be without ben elton and richard curtis
who are also behind the film like love actually 
the thin blue line 
four wedding and a funeral .
black adder is funny and almost too good for television .
humor can be smart 
sexy 
and funny all at one .
i was hoping last night on saturday night live
that hugh laurie would pay homage to his background in british humor .
if the gang at snl did some research ,
they would know
what a treasure it was to have hugh laurie grace their stage .
