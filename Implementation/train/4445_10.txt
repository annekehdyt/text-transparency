this is not a bad film .
it is not wildly funny ,
but it is interesting andentertaining .
it has a few funny moment .
cher gives a goodperformance in a role
that is very opposite her real-life self .
herperformance alone is worth the watch .
if this movie had come outtoday
it would not have been nominated 
but by '80 standard itwas excellent .
