i wasted my time and gave this show a chance .
this has to be one of the worst new show .
if they gave an award to show
that suck this one should sweep the category .
the acting is poor
and the story line is contrived .
now dinosaurs was a bit strange
but at least it was entertaining .
that show lasted three season
and was finally scraped .
this new show ,
based on an insurance company commercial ,
is not funny
and really has nothing going for it .
possibly the original commercial and the amount of time
they were ,
and still are ,
repeated is what is wrong with this show .
it just came to tv
and already we are tired of seeing the `` caveman '' character .
