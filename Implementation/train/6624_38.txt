cash
( now played by khrystyne haje in for angelina jolie )
has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland
( after her protector has died from old age ,
said
protector was played by elias kotea 
an actual decent actor )
and now she finds
that person wander through the rubble
looking for cyborgs
to trade for scrap metal and cash .
she leads a group of burned out cyborgs
( that includes william katt 
evan lurie and a human scientist
played by zach galligan )
against bounty hunter richard lynch .
malcolm mcdowell has two minute of screen time as lynch 's employer .
cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entry
but it still is a largely dull feature .
the problem this time is that the idea with potential are never used well ,
the action sequence are routine
and the name cast such as mcdowell 
katt and galligan are given little to do .
haje is indeed a whiny heroine
and lynch is too over the top
( as usual )
and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad
as it is hilarious predecessor .
( the one with van damme ,
the second one is just dull . )
also disappointing is the science fiction angle
which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has .
as an action flick this is routine and by the number b-movie stuff
and it is competently made ,
that is the only thing positive
i can say about it .
*1/2 out of 4-
