this was a real guilt pleasure ...
i saw the trailer and all the advertising ,
so i figured 'why not check out this vh1 movie ? '
and ,
as they used to say on t.v. ,
'i can not believe
i watched the whole thing ! '
quinn and harris were believable beatle boy ,
and ,
although the accent were sort of over-the-top and difficult to decipher at time ,
i found the dialogue believable as well .
the film touched upon the tenuous relationship of len/mc
and showed how 
deep down 
they were simply two guy
who grew up close together
and shared a passion for music - coming at it 
though 
with different set of issue and personal need .
you find yourself wishing
they had hopped in the cab to snl for an impromptu reunion
that would have knocked the world 's sock off ,
but you also gain a greater appreciation for why
they did not
