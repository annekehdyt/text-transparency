i first saw this film around ten year ago
and i thought
it was very funny indeed .
it was not as bad
as some critic were making it out to be .
the fact
that it was written by the usually dependable john hughe shows
that you can at least expect some funny dialogue .
( by the way ,
i also think
weird science is quite good
which was also penned in lightning speed by hughe )
.the film has a very garish look
to it using all the primary colour - red 
yellow etc -
which makes it look quite unique .
the cast are also quite good .
the prudish bunny packard and the devil-possessed delore salk are a stand
out.the film has certainly dated a little
but i personally prefer it to all the other 'lampoon ' series .
