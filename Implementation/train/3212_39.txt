one two three four five six seven eight and back 
haha .
this is a must see 
first of all
to see the work out .
there are a lot of work out shown ,
see those close up ,
man you will enjoy it .
a few year ago a video clip was surely based on this movie .
it is a slasher but
without suspense .
the ending is funny too ,
and the clothe she is wearing in the wood
confronting the copper 
jesus 
looks like a clown .
the killing are mostly done off screen 
the blood flows but never too gory .
there are a lot of fight scene 's too ,
and hey ,
no one got hurt .
and what about the weapon to kill ,
never seen a big one like that ,
will not spoil it ,
you must see it .
and being a slasher there is a lot of tanda too .
to guess
who 's the killer you will be trapped a few time
and that is the best part ,
but what about the story of the copper in the wood 
huh !
but still due his cheesiness this one is still one
that many would like to have .
i am glad
that i have my copy 
one of those slasher failure .
but man 
those clothe and not to mention the hairstyle !
if you are in your 40 's then this is one is back to memory lane .
