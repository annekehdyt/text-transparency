( note :
i thought i would be the only one writing
what i did below ,
but i see the other here agree .
i guess
it was pretty obvious -
this was overdoing the bait-the-cat bit .
anyway 
here is what i had written : )
the owner have left on vacation for two week - a trip to california -
leaving the cat
( sylvester )
all alone
and locked in the house .
that means no milk ,
but the cat 
to his relief 
does find a bunch of canned tuna .
however 
to his dismay 
he can not find
the opener.it turns out
the little mouse in the house has it ...
and baits the cat with it .
this is a mean rodent
who keeps teasing sylvester with the opener
and then yanking it away at the last second .
sylvester try everything possible to open the can of tuna
but can not do it .
this is a frustrating story ,
and why they make the sadistic mouse
the `` good guy '' is beyond me .
it is like some of the tom and jerry cartoon
where poor tom always gets the worst of it
even though many time the little mouse starts the conflict !
