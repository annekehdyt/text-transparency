this oddity in the new doris day collection does not really need to be included
as she is only in the film for less than 30 minute .
what she does do however ,
is shine
when she is on screen .
the near plot less movie is just an excuse
to showcase some warner contract player of the day .
jancie rule show promise
and it is a shame
she did not become a big star .
ruth roman handles the role of the `` go-getter '' with aplomb .
better if this was in color .
the travis air force base location with some rear projection work well .
what is best about the movie are some wonderful musical interlude .
if you enjoyed thank your lucky star and hollywood can noteen you will like this one .
