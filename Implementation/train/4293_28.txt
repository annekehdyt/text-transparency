during the civil war 
there were many case of divided loyalty ;
obviously 
many occurred `` in the border state '' ,
where north met south by happenstance of geography .
from the border 
young father owen moore goes off
to join the union army .
shortly 
confederate soldier henry b. walthall 
separated from his regiman 
wander onto the enemy 's property 
desperate for water ;
he finds a supply
where the unionist 's young daughter glady egan sit .
when the yankee soldier track him down ,
little glady innocently helps the confederate hide .
later ,
when he returns to kill her father ,
the little girl 's kindness is remembered .
a sweet 
small story from director d.w. griffith .
location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed .
