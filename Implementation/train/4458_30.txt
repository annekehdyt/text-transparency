it is obvious that all of the good review posted for this movie so far are from insider
who were either involved with the film or
who know somebody
who knows somebody
and have thus seen multiple cut .
well 
i do not know anyone involved ,
and i have seen the final cut ,
and it is pure garbage .
the only thing
it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legend
( none on screen for terribly long ) .
it is as if the filmmaker made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention
and got actor like tony todd 
tom savini 
david hess and michael berryman to film scene during their coffee eak .
this is an ultra-cheap ,
shot-on-video wannabe x-file with terrible
acting from a cast of non-actor with more mullet
than is acceptable in the 21st century .
there is little or no action ;
it is all overly explanatory dialogue
that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot .
ther computer fx are a joke ,
but there are not enough of them nor enough action
to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way .
after about 8 straight scene of nothing but talking 
you will find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button ...
and not letting go .
absolutely worthless .
