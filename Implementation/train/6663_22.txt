`` the sweet is never as sweet
without the sour . ''
this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion .
tom cruise plays a young man
who was handed everything in his life .
he takes thing for granted
and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist .
this film will keep you engaged in the plot
and unable to pause it to take a bathroom eak.its a movie
that really makes you step back and look at your life
and how you live it .
you can not really appreciate the better thing in life
( the sweet ) ,
like love 
until you have experienced the bad
( the sour ) .
the theme will really get you to `` open your eye ''
.only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at point
and is hard to really understand .
i think
the end is perfect though .
i recommend you watch it and see for yourself .
