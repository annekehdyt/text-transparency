i am sorry to report
that i have seen this film several time .
when it bombed at the box office ,
it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo .
and i watched it over
and over because television in general is so bad
-- or was at that time .
i no longer watch ,
so it might be wonderful now
-- like samuel l jackson says about swine ,
`` it might taste like sweet potato pie ,
but i will never know
because i would not eat the filthy mfer . ''
let 's see .
dudley play arthur wandering in the desert ,
always a few step behind mosis .
it came out right after life of bryan ,
so you can guess
where the inspiration for this came from .
the few mildly funny bit go on way
too long until you just close your eye and grit your tooth .
there is one scene
where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert ,
both of them dragged out and dessicated ,
dying of thirst .
then they meet like old acquaintance
who did not really know each other very well ,
promise to do lunch .
it could have been funny.but the scene
that
i remember
most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh
in which pharaoh is a black street kid
done up in full king tut regalia .
he must have read the line straight
because at some point before the release 
they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo
voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe
( kid dyno-wannabe ) .
or it might have been jimmy walker
-- who knows ?
who cares .
they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist 
very unfunny 
very long piece of excrement 
one of those legendary thing
that just will not flush ,
no matter how many time you try ,
so you leave it there for someone else to deal with.well
that is my review .
if you rent this movie
( do not buy it ,
whatever you do ! )
prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of corona.now
that they have remade the poseiden adventure ,
this one is probably high on the list for remake .
maybe they will hire a comedy writer this time .
