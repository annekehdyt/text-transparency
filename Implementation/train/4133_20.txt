this is one of those movie
where i wish
i had just stayed in the bar.the film is quite frankly boring .
what story there is is very flimsy
and you pretty much have to guess at it .
the film indulges itself with pretentious camera technique
that seem intent on causing migraine
and makes it look like a student film .
did i say
it was boring already ?
if all the character had suddenly
died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less
as i had no emotional attachment to any of them.there
are about 4 good minute in this movie ,
but that was about it .
this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance ,
but i held on believing
that it had to get better .
i was wrong.the sort of film
you could threaten naughty child with .
