i stopped short of giving `` mr. blanding builds his dream house '' 10/10 due to an aspect
that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit :
the fact
that a black person is the faithful servant
( somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit ) .
but other than that 
the movie 's a hoot .
portraying middle class new york couple jim
( cary grant )
and muriel blanding
( myrna loy )
trying to build a house in connecticut ,
this flick has something for everyone.grant is his usual flippant self ,
while loy does quite well as merely a wife .
but melvyn douglas adds some real laugh as jim 's and muriel 's lawyer bill cole ,
who seems to have more plan
than he is making clear .
as for the house itself ... throughout most of the movie ,
you will probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there .
the builder 
contractor 
and other also provide their fair share of laugh.all in all 
a comedy classic .
also starring louise beaver 
reginald denny 
sharyn moffett 
connie marshall and jason robard sr .
