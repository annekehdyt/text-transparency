this was an excellent idea
and the scenery was beautiful
but that is where it ends .
it seemed like a lackluster set
it off meets the west .
the plot barely made any sense .
there were so many character and not enough time
to develop their personality .
there were too may unnecessary thing
going on that did not pertain to the plot
nor did
it help further the story along .
there were also long blank moment
where the plot could have been explored
but was used for silence or unnecessary conversation .
the script should have made more sense as well as the directing .
i had a huge question mark on my head
watching this movie .
but the casting was great in my opinion .
if you are only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you .
