this production of oliver is masterful in showing layer of evil in the human soul .
what makes the story remarkable is a illiantly ight unseen character ,
who pierces this darkness
as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest danger safely into the hand of his own relative .
yea ,
though oliver walk through the valley of the shadow of death ,
he fears no evil .
a rod and staff are there to comfort him .
in the end 
he is saved from the dregs of humanity .
at the bottom is fagin 
the most wicked of the lot .
fagin contemplates repenting of his way not once 
but twice 
yet decline
because he is unwilling to pay the price .
fagin is worse than bill sike ,
because he raises little pickpocket
who become murderer .
in the middle is oliver .
his innocence is unsullied 
but untried as well .
the best is nancy .
lacking in judgment ,
she ignores bill sike ' violent nature out of her deep need for love .
yet unlike fagin 
at the probable cost of her own life 
she does repent of her sin by saving oliver from bill .
thing are not as they seem .
in my opinion 
this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability .
i would give this film a `` 10 
''
but its '70 's made-for-tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting .
overall 
a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audience .
