my boyfriend and i rented this
because we thought
it might be a good 'halloween ' take-off .
a killer terrorizing young person 
a white mask ... you get my drift .
we were dead wrong !
no pun intended .
we not only discovered one of the worst movie out there ,
but also that it is a cult classic !
it is filled w/plot hole
and makes no sense .
the actress
who plays maddy
is pretty ,
but that is about it .
i do give credit
for it being shot on a very low budget
-- i always support movie like that .
just not this particular one.this movie may be good to see
if you are drunk or high ;
otherwise do not bother .
unless you want to lose your movie privilege like i did !
