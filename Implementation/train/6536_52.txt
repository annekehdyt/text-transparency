the reviewer
who called this movie a bust
has clearly missed the point .
it is obvious
he has not been young or innocent in a very long time ,
or he might have understood
that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young character actually thought
they could make a difference
by putting up poster
and holding a rave for peace .
if only it was that easy .
but the cynic sit and sneer at person
who earnestly try their best
to make thing better ,
as the situation gets worse
and worse every single day .
well ,
if you are not part of the solution ,
you are part of the problem.the central theme
is that revenge beget more revenge ,
which beget even more 
in an ever-expanding bloodbath .
both side will tell you tale of atrocity committed by the other side ,
which
they think
justify their committing even more in retaliation .
where does it end ?
and apparently he missed the significance of `` the bubble '' referred to in the name ,
which was that person
living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly reality
of what is going on all around them ,
which is partly why they seemed so naive .
( he also seemed to think
that ashraf could slip through the checkpoint without a problem ,
which tells me
he was not paying attention
when ashraf related the delay and problem
he had encountered . )
i found it very ave of the director 
the screenplay writer 
and both star-crossed lover ,
to update the romeo and juliet story to a modern troubled land ,
and to make both lover male .
let 's be honest here :
very few person would have a problem
if one of them had been a female
( young love wins all heart ) --
but when person 's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact
that 
incredibly 
these same person would rather have them hate each other ,
then the conclusion is inevitable .
