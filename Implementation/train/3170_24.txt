hello playmates.i recently watched this film for the first time ever
and it is also my first experience of arthur askey ,
i have to admit i was very impressed by this film .
as a fan of black and white film generally 
passport to pimlico 
the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder
( who is apparently a distant relative ) ,
this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour .
i notice
that there are some on here
who have criticised askey 's performance 
however in my opinion
it stands the test of time as a fine example of forty comic acting
and if anything adds to the picture
by creating character
that are more than the mere stereotype
which seem to so dominate film now.if
you can get hold of this film i
would recommend you get hold of it ,
shame these film generally are not shown on sunday afternoon anymore.i am
also glad to have had the opportunity
to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley
( private godfrey in dad 's army )
.i thank you
