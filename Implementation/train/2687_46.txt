i just want to start by saying
this is the first review of a film i have done on the net .
i felt the need
to warn person about this film
because it truly is one of the worst film i
have ever seen .
after reading interview with the director he says
he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinion
as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.1 .
the actor .
i know
the budget may not have allowed for great thespian
but with nicholson working in the industry for over ten year surely
he knew some actor
who were at least average.2 .
the incredibly lame make up and special effect .
once again budget obviously interfered
with what was originally intended but
after working in make up for so many year there is really no excuse.3 .
the obvious similarity to hostel .
whilst not being exactly a rip off
it sure does try to cash in on the former film success .
only problem is roth knew
where he was going
and exactly how to get there ... 4. the music .
not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.5 .
the script in general .
all dialogue was forced and terrible !
also the sub plot about the theatre and the guy
who comes in to save them
were weak as and almost like an afterthought.6 .
the editing .
wtf .
how jarring 
and not in a good way .
nuf said.seriously i would like to hear the director 's thought on my post
( he no doubt frequents his page on imdb . )
cause buddy ... what were you thinking .
surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised
what a turkey yolu had on your hand ...
sorry i do not want to be harsh
but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature
that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better ,
hopefully practice makes progress.but in the mean time avoid this like the plague .
i want my 81 min back with interest .
( at least i did not pay to watch it . )
