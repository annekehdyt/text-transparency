unless somebody enlightens me ,
i really have no idea
what this movie is about .
it looks like a picture with a message
but it\u00b4s far from it .
this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problem .
and 
that\u00b4s basically all .
when that agent is played by pacino ,
one must think
that it must be something important .
but it takes no hard thinking
to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is .
to one of the best actor in the world 
al pacino 
this is the second movie of the year
( the other is `` simone '' )
that deserves the title `` the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year '' .
so 
what\u00b4s going on 
al ?
