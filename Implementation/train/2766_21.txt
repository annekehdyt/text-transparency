two day
after seeing this thing ,
i am still in agony over having seen it .
it is so bad ,
you have to wonder
how anyone could write this tripe ,
much less allow it to be loose on the general public .
stilted acting 
a leading man
who looks like he
is sleepwalking ,
and alison eastwood embarrassing herself .
the action is indicative of low budget movie making ,
which means it is painfully bad .
the plot ?
well ,
if you were 6 year old ,
then you could have written this movie .
simplistic 
idealistic 
and just plain lame .
