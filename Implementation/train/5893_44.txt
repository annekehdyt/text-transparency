i was dying to see this
once i saw the ridiculous meatball poster and divined
that it had to be the best satire ever .
what a illiant idea for a satire
-- the genre is rife .
unfortunately 
the finished product
( as i think
all involved probably realize )
is a catalogue of missed opportunity 
not-quite-there performance and ( thankfully ! )
a few extremely hilarious 
inspired bit .
janeane garafolo ,
who is very striking ,
looks really bad here ,
probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny .
david hyde pierce is just sad to watch ,
trying to hard to be funny
and looking like a castro nerd .
molly shannon is so funny just seeing her makes you laugh ,
but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical .
paul rudd had great teen mannerism
and was sexy as hell ,
the other guy are also really funny
( the nerdier one ) .
i think
the problem is the director
just does not move thing along at the right pace .
he starts out very deadpan ,
and that sets the monotone .
but when he lets thing get really outrageous
( the drug sequence is the second funniest moment
i have had all year in movie ,
the first also coming in a lame movie :
andrea martin in all over the guy
complaining about the movie in and out ) ,
it is just plain funny .
i wanted this movie to work so badly ,
but it just did not .
the clothe and styling for 1981 are 99.9 % perfect ,
and the very few song used are also perfect .
this ends up as a medium-bad mad tv episode 
complete with frustratingly overlong sketch .
