i watched this movie for a project on love .
please tell nicolas cage
to learn
what it would feel like to be his character ,
and then re-read the line he is saying .
my life can not go on ... i accidentally cut off my own hand ...
my other was close by .
obviously his fault .
and since when have happy ending included the nice guy
who takes care of mom sad and alone .
no closure 
bad script 
and does not have enough extension of minor character .
save yourself ,
unless your up for a good laugh .
costume were done appropriately ,
and extra did a fabulous job .
i am sure
it would have been a fun movie
to make ,
but keep it more genre specific ,
i can not recommend this movie to anyone i know ,
because it is not an intellectual movie .
it is not a chick flick .
it is not a strict romantic .
and i can not show kid
because of the sex and question to follow .
all in all 
just not a good flick .
