despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential .
set as a prequel to the original `` star trek '' series
it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer 
rick berman ,
who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a `` star trek '' series could be
( which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint ) .
the actual show-runner 
brannon braga 
did not help matter by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episode and careless disregard of the franchise 's internal mythology
( it was painfully obvious early on
that he was in it only for the paycheck ) .
never have i seen a series '
that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actor
( jolene blaylock excepted )
last so long .
it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape
where the audience
( even a trekker audience )
is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desire .
unfortunately it appears
as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher up at paramount
that `` enterprise '' suffered from `` franchise fatigue ''
and that its core audience was did not walk away
but was driven off .
produce a quality offering
that lives up to the high ideal and standard of its predecessor
and they
( the audience )
will come.simply put 
in a teevee universe
where we are given show like `` battlestar :
galactica ''
and `` the shield '' the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a `` star trek ''
that measures up
and is dramatically competitive .
it is just that straightforward and easy .
