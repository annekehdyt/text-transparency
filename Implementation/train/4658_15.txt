and my child love it now !
granted 
i can watch it now
and realize
the animation was not that great ,
and that the plot is trite .
hey ,
if every villian introduced themselves by saying
`` i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt '' i think
they might be laughed at ,
but for young child it is a moral story with catchy music.music so catchy 
mind you ,
that i still had the word memorized
after not seeing this film in twenty year .
i would definitely suggest this one for younger child .
