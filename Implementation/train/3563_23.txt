way back
when i was renting videos for free i
picked this one up .
oops the thing i wanted to mention outside the summary
already given were these .
1 :
someone
who had a lot
to do with making this movie
had a strange and sick fascination for food ,
it was gross and unecessary .
2 :
there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film
that seems to be there the entire time
and by the way i felt for day
after viewing this trash i figure
they had something subliminal going on in the track .
either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both .
many time throughout the movie
you can tell
the writer
and director did not have much experience or talent .
and do not even ask about the acting .
