wow 
this was a very bad movie ...
as read in other comment this movie has no plot ,
no character development ,
they possibly had some kind of script
but it is difficult to tell
based on the actual end result.the editing of this movie was really non-existent ,
it tends to jump from scene to scene
without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick
that was not thought out at all 
has bad acting 
bad dialogue 
bad everything.the only thing
that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor ,
i think
this must be where they spent whatever money
they had to try to justify making this.unless
you are
( like me )
dedicated to finding
and watching all the zombie flicks you can find ,
do not watch this .
period .
