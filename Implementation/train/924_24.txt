absolute masterpiece of a film !
goodnight mr.tom has swiftly become one of my favourite film of all time .
nobody should miss out on seeing this film ,
it is just too good !
mr.tom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man
who becomes a soft father-figure
when william beech
( nick robinson )
is sent to him for evacuation 
almost like 'the town mouse and the country mouse ' .
a truly heart wrenching film .
the director knew exactly how to turn book into film
and he has done so extremely well .
the film was so excellently shot
that the emotion of the character
and what was happening
made the audience feel a range of emotion from love to fear ,
and these emotion could turn on a six-pence .
set in a time of turmoil during world war two ,
this film also shows the difference between the city and the countryside ,
they are almost like different country .
an absolute must see 
those
who do not are missing out on a truly amazing and illiant film .
