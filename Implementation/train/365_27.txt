ten out of the 11 short film in this movie are masterpiece
( i found only the egyptian one disappointing ) .
stragely 
all but the mexican director chose to portray the problem of individual or group in connection with 9-11 :
the afghan refugee 
deaf person 
palestinian 
the widow of sreenica 
aid and poverty and corruption in africa 
pinochet coup and ensuing bloodbath 
suicide bombing in israel 
paranoia-hit and state-persecuted muslim american in the usa 
old person
living alone ,
and the aftermath of wwii in the heart of asian soldier .
this might say something sad about the limit of empathy 
in both way :
the director might feel
that american ignore the pain of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedy ,
while they effectively do the same with their short film.surprising myself ,
i found sean penn 's piece one of the very best in the collection 
and ***spoiler ahead*** i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life 's happiest moment
when the sun shine through his window
after the wtc `` collapsed out of light 's way '' ,
i guess
this might also be one of the most offending
as the general american audience would see it .
