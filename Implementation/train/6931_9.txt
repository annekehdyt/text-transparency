this is one of the best jodie foster movie out there
and largely ignored due to the general public 's misconception of it as a teen flick .
it has wonderful performance 
particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother ,
played by a convincing sally kellerman .
the three girl
that play jodie 's friend are somewhat amateurish
but i do think
it is worth seeing .
