the ringmaster stars jerry springer as a tv talkshow host
called jerry ,
but it`s not the jerry springer show ,
his guest are trailer trash ,
but not the trailer trash you get on the jerry springer show ,
they attack one another ,
but not like on ... ..what is the point
of making a movie about the jerry springer show
and pretending it`s not the jerry springer show ?
and on top of that this is a very boring film
