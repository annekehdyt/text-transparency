like all cult tv show 
there is a group of person
who love the twilight zone so much
that they rate practically every episode like
they are the greatest show ever .
while several of them are indeed wonderful classic ,
the truth is for every great episode ,
there were several
that were mediocre and at least one that stank .
however 
like die-hard trekky 
these zone lover insist
that all of them are gold .
in fact 
this is what initially got me to review some individual episode of a couple cult series instead of the movie i
usually watch.while this is not the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst ,
it is poor by any reasonable standard .
a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldier going past her home .
in the end 
a very unexpected twist is revealed
and there is not a whole lot of excitement or suspense here .
