i guess
that everyone has to make a comeback at some point .
and that is exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee
( robin william )
intends to do in `` the best of time '' .
yep 
the man
who went all crazy with the radio in `` good morning 
vietnam ''
is playing football .
in this case 
he seeks to replay a game
that cost his high school a prestigious title .
but ex-teammate reno hightower
( kurt russell )
is not just going to go along with it so easily.granted ,
it is not the best movie for either man .
but william and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team .
and some of the name in this movie are likely to give you the giggle
( to say the least ) .
check it out .
