i rented this by mistake .
i thought 
after a cursory examination of the box ,
that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story .
instead 
it is a `` christian '' story ,
and i suppose is fairly typical example .
if you are sold on the message
you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc. ,
but i found it rather painful .
i have to admit
that i am bothered by the rewriting of history in this story .
it paints the 1890 's as some sort of paradise of family value and morality
( a character is aghast
that 5 % of marriage end in divorce !
) ,
but it overlooks very unsavory side of this `` highly moral '' society
( rigid racial 
sexual ,
and social discrimination were widespread 
for instance ) .
and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about thing
that sound not all that different than the complaint of some iranian leader about woman 's clothing style
( as reported in a recent wsj )
.overall ,
thought 
i suppose
that it is the sort of thing
you will like if you like this sort of thing ,
and it is certainly wholesome ...
