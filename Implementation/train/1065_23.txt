i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience ,
and the only thing
which kept me in my seat
was the chance
to fill out the post-screening survey .
i felt
the film 's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot .
instead 
it was composed of ( too )
many sub-plots competing for screen time .
as a result 
there is not a single character
who is developed enough for the audience
to form any sort of attachment .
what the director and producer failed to do was show us
why we should care what happens to the character .
in fact any one sub-plot and the character
associated with it could have been removed altogether
without serious detriment to the film .
( the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub-plots and character . )
simply put ,
the hungry bachelor club 's plate is overcrowded with side dish and appetizer
when an entre is desired .
