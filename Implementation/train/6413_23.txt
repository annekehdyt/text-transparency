perhaps i could not find the dvd menu selection for plot :
on off .
clearly 
the default is off .
when the end credits began to roll ,
i could not believe
that was it .
like our poor 
but beautiful protagonist 
i felt used 
dirty ,
cheap ... .the character were drawn in very oad stroke
and the writer 's disdain for wealthy thatcherite was all to apparent .
i consider myself a `` roosevelt democrat '' ,
but would appreciate a bit more subtlety.of course ,
the problem could be with me .
i see
that many other seem to find some meaning or message in this picture .
ala 
not i. the only thing
that kept me from giving this a `` 1 ''
was the nice scenery 
human and plant .
