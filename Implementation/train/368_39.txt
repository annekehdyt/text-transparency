this belgian film ,
directed by tom barman ,
singer of the well-known group deus ,
will not be favoured by everyone .
for the simple reason
that there is not a clear story
or even a plot .
this movie just shows 24 hour in `` a city ''
( here antwerp )
and allows you to watch
and truly enjoy the dialogue 
the directing 
the humorous
( dario ! ,
the osteopath bruno ! 
... )
and tragic
( windman 
paul garcin 
... )
characters.there are several memorable scene :
the windman on the beach 
the dance party at the end 
the kiss-fan 
windman visits the osteopath 
... clearly
some other viewer did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie .
they complain
that this movie has no story 
etc .
but it is the atmosphere
that keeps you
watching
and that will drag you into it.if you
did not watch it yet ,
be sure to listen carefully to the music .
the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group deus.and `` ssst 
mondje dicht h\u00e9 . ''
( do not tell anyone )
