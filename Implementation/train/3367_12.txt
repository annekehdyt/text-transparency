this unpleasant film has little to recommend it .
dolph lundgren gives a performance
that is better than either this script or his other action film have allowed .
and there are occasional snippet of dialog
that suggest
the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.but no .
motivation are either murky or trite .
most of the acting is sub-par .
the script creates needless confusion .
and the director 's needless fascination
with focusing on gore is distracting.it is hard to imagine
who the audience is for this film .
