first of all ; it is very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from position of gun 
germ and steel .
the same tried to do marxist from economical position.the
reason of western success can not be just dumb luck 
the advantage of domesticated plant and animal .
we see ,
that all around the world any advantage and bonuse are complete useless
if they are not wisely managed .
in the japan there is not huge natural resource ,
but japan is one of the top world economy ,
the same situation in singapore 
but in nigerium 
country with rich oil resource 
there are only middle-low success .
both of this nation had and still have access to western technology and invention ,
but why such gap ?
in the end of movie daimond declared ,
that it is very important to understand factor of gun 
germ and steel 
to understand .
maybe the main factor of world 's difference is not geography ,
but person ability
to understand and use thing ?
the mental ability to understand .
and in this case geography is only subordinated .
