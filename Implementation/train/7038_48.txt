this is the second baby burlesk short
to be released ,
and probably the most popular one 
is a spoof of the 1926 silent film
what price glory.i watched this
and i do not understand the kiddie-porn
that is being claimed .
it is just a cute little film .
i have seen family shows
that i grew up watching in the '80 's and '90 's
that had little girl
dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner ' .
it was more provocative
because they were not dressed in diaper .
there is nothing provocative about a diaper unless
you have one of those fetish .
( just a joke )
i read
that description of the movie
and where it states only a pedophile
would enjoy watching this .
that is sick .
to me ,
if you watch this and are bothered by it ,
then maybe you need to look into your own psyche
and try to figure out why it bothers you .
it is an innocent film
that was made as a parody of another film .
all of the b.b .
film were parody ,
nothing more .
the parody/spoofs of today are graphic in nature
and have true almost pornographic scene and quite vile language .
should not those be more appalling ?
i can watch those without issue ,
but they sometimes take child 's story
and turn them into filth on those parody .
that is what should get under your skin .
not that they babified
( not a word ,
i know )
an adult movie from 1926 ,
because we know
how pornographic those silent film were 
huh ?
not to mention those 'forbidden hollywood pre-code era film ' so vile and filthy .
they would never make such filth today ?
( note the sarcasm )
