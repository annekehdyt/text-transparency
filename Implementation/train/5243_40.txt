1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly
without device like universal translator or translator microbe ?
did the creator of this show realize
that person
who were taken from different part of the earth 
in different time frame
( attilla the hun was not a contemporary of preliterate hellenic culture ,
nor were the viking contemporary to the pyramid builder )
speak different language
and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english
( except for the inflection they `` do not '' use ) ,
which has been influenced by latin 
ancient greek 
danish and french ?
2 cultural difference can not be overcome so easily ,
trust has to be won ,
yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed
without any suspicion and start ordering person around like they are their appointed leader .
of course real fan would comment
that they are perceived as god .
the person
they meet
should be shocked by their technology
and accuse them of witchcraft and the like.3 historical background :
none .
visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture ,
but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloth or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horn
and claim to look the part .
a small-town theater group probably has better props.4 boring !
another lame canuck production ,
which inexplicably ran for ten long year .
as a kid show
it could make the grade 
but anyone
who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language
could not bear to even watch the first twelve episode of season 1 ,
like i just did .
i very much wanted to believe
i had found a decent sci-fi show ,
otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minute !
