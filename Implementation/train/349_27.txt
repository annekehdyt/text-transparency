despite the mysteriously positive review and high rating ,
this is an awful movie .
awful enough ,
that l feel obligated to warn you
how bad it is .
the movie is set in the final period of the raj 
during the time of india 's fight for independence .
what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief .
what the character do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the character exist in that era .
for instance 
would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master ,
knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment ?
unlikely 
but still maybe .
however 
would the same young hindu housemaid 
in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spear in heat ,
partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view
where they might be discovered at any moment ?
that is not only bloody unlikely ,
that is a retarded plot line.such idiocy
combined with the poor acting ,
drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie ,
so i did not watch the second half of the movie .
one could only hope
the ending is of more intelligence
than what i saw in the first half .
