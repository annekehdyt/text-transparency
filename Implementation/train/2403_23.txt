i saw this movie ,
and the play 
and i have to add
that this was the most touching story
that i had ever seen .
until i saw
this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african child and adult
that were and are living in that era .
it ought tears to my eye and much sadness to my heart
that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive ,
and to ing the child right out of that area and teach them to act and preform
and turn them loose
to tell their own story is simply amazing .
this simply surpass a five star ,
i rate it a ten .
thank you mr. mbongeni ngema for such a astonishing story .
although it has been 12 year
since this story has been told ,
it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.if there is a vhs 
or dvd out there on the play ,
please notify me asap.thank you .
ps there was nothing wrong with the kid wanting to ing awareness of their problem and condition to the attention of other country in hope
that some one would have a heart and offer assistance .
