i was all ready to pan this episode ,
seeing
that this 'master ' really does not have any horror film under his belt..
but this is easily the best episode of the season.the acting was good ! !
i do not know
how he wrangled it ,
but we have got some real talent in this episode !
and while you could see thing coming from a mile away plot wise ,
at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 min ,
something
that has been lacking up to this point in the series.i especially liked the bit at the end ,
not a twist per say ,
but just a funny little bit where he becomes 
as ever 
the hen-pecked hubby.really good effort .
like i have said
in other reviews- these are not true master
doing a lot of these episodes..
but they may someday end up being master in the future .
