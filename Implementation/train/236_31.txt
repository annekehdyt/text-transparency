i have read the whole 'a wrinkle in time ' book
and then saw the movie .
the movie contained all the element in the book
but since the book was 190 page
and the film was 2 hour
it felt really crammed in with too many effect and bad acting.a wrinkle in time is about a girl
named meg 
charle wallace ,
and calvin must team together
to find meg 's father
and get off the island camazotz .
the beginning of the film is really a stinker .
the acting is awful ,
the direction is laughable ,
and so far the situation are not necessary .
i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle
that wrote the book
and created the movie ,
made a great book 
and a terrible film .
the acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting .
yes 
i got to admit
there was cool effect .
but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible .
if you read the book
you
will be crushed by the movie .
i wish could give it a 0
but sadly i can only give it 1. a half
could have been useful .
