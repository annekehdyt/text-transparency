there is a lot of good
that can be said for this cartoon ;
the background are rich 
lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco detail .
the animation is up to the usual studio standard of the time ,
which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day .
however 
i find it tedious for a number of reasons.the music :
it is definitely not up to scott bradley 's usual standard .
although it is probably supposed to be evocative of a `` great gatsby '' setting ,
it ends up being dreary 
sleepy 
repetitious and monotonous
( repetitious and monotonous are not the same ,
as beethoven 's 5th symphony attest ) .
since most person
( including me )
tend to close their eye
when they yawn ,
there is a lot of the visual part of the cartoon
that will be missed by the average viewer.the storyline :
i am not giving away any secret
that are not already in the plot summary - country good 
city bad .
this is a common theme in film 
both animated and live 
from this era .
it is a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll ,
which 
in the present day 
is reflected in a similar nostalgia for `` value ''
that never were .
