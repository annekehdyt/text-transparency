`` person i know ''
is a clunker with no one
to root for and no one to care about
-- despite the game effort of a talented cast.pacino deliver his usual tour de force as eli wurman 
a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed
out by a lifetime of moral corruption .
but unlike michael corleone 
it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character 
his dilemma 
or his fate.the film trace eli 's preparation for a benefit for a liberal political cause ,
while distracted by a client 's
( ryan o'neal 
good in an underwritten part )
latest `` dirty laundry ''
-- in this case 
a tv actress companion
who 's gotten involved with the wrong person .
tea leoni ings her customary star power to this supporting role 
although again ,
the script does not give her much to work with .
as eli 's sister-in-law 
kim basinger manage to evoke sympathy
despite implausible plot mechanics.this movie is strictly for those
who like watching pacino strut his stuff ,
and enjoy the other principal .
unfortunately 
between the script and direction ,
`` person i know ''
is strictly amateurish .
hence its limited theatrical release 
and speedy journey to dvd .
consider yourself warned .
