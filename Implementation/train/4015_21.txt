la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie
that is both related to the time
it was released
( post-68 )
and eternal in many respect .
true 
the actor do not `` act '' ... true ,
they talk a lot ...
but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living ... or dying .
the very long monologue
spoken by fran\u00e7oise leun
is perhaps the most accurate and moving text
that was ever written about womanhood 
manhood and love .
not easy to translate accurately 
though .
this movie is a statement about the difficulty
of being a man and a woman
( or two woman in this case ) .
and imho 
jean pierre l\u00e9aud is one of the greatest french actor .
