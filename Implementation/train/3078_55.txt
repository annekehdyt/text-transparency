usually musical in the 1940 's were of a set formula -
and if you studied film
you know
what i am talking about - a certain running lenghth 
very `` showy '' performance
that were great on the surface
but never got into the real personality of the character etc.this one is different - and light year better and well worth
it is nomination for best picture of the year - 1945
( although had no chance of beating the eventual winner -
lost weekend )
.gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes
i know about `` american in paris ''
and `` singing in the rain '' .
this one is different .
he really gets into his character of a `` sea wolf ''
thinking
( at first )
that `` picking up any girl
while on leave ''
is nothing more than a lark .
and if you had to make up a `` story ''
to get her -
so be it - until .
sort of like the music man
when he gets `` his foot caught in the door '' .
the eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal
( sinatra )
's attempt to make the `` story '' good
in order to `` get the girl ''
that he really
and unexpectedly falls in love with .
you are going to have to see the movie
to see what i mean.besides
that there are so many other element of great film in this one ,
it is a classic buddy story 
nostalgia to a time
when wwii was almost over
( the war ended about a month after the film release ) ,
a realization
that a guy
that always laughed at life
can find out
that he really is a great human
being 
great song and probably a few other element of classic film
making
that i can not think of right now.why not a 10 ?
near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hour starts to feel a bit long .
there is a small ballet number
that gene kelly does
that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated
and feel
like it just adds minute now .
but overall 
this one a definite winner on every level .
