i love alec guinness .
and that is saying a lot after this film .
actually 
he is not bad in it .
he just seems to stand aside ,
be urbane and his usual delightful self ,
but invest nada .
it is obvious the girl
he is matched with is a featherweight 
even as an inexperienced young french girl .
sir alec would not have chosen her
when he was young
and very obviously is not too happy
about it now.the interesting character is the ooding other of the odd `` suzanne '' 
another twit .
`` donald '' aspire to be a french heathcliffe and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery .
what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead ?
was he in love with the father 's mistress ?
why did he jerk suzanne 's hair
when she plotted to ing the disparate part of this turkey together on the country estate ?
or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting.the film would have been charming with guiness and the `` older woman '' reminiscing
and seeing paris together .
that would have been a great story !
two lovely experienced person in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii .
why did not somebody come up with that ?
i suggest watching alec guiness in `` the card '' 
a little
known but worthwhile film .
