i have a two year old son
who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy .
i never got the chance
to meet him
but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him .
i hope
he knows
how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferer by raising awareness of this terrible condition .
this man has touched person in a way
that a million charity leaflet could not .
i believe
that this should be compulsory viewing in school .
i also agree with other comment -
what have i got to moan about ?
he took everything
that life could throw at him
and still managed to retain a sense of humour .
god bless .
i could not watch the part
that showed his dressing being changed .
i have enough trouble with my son 's .
