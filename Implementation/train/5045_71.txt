`` raising victor vargas '' is one of those light 
family movie
that you can watch
and do the n.y. time crossword puzzle at the same time .
and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona ,
you do not have to `` pause '' the dvd .
just let it roll ,
'cause you will not be missing anything really important .
no twist 
turns 
or tension .
it is not really an ethnic movie ,
it is a movie about a poor ,
struggling immigrant family
that happens to be latino .
they could have been any ethnic group .
it made very little difference .
i have seen it all a zillion time before .
just plug in a jewish family 
an italian family 
a black family 
or an irish family .
just the accent and name were different .
if the vargas family was named bush or clinton
and were presbyterian ,
the movie would have been a total snooze .
it is funny that the critic here could not get the locale straight .
some said
it was spanish harlem .
some the bronx 
and another brooklyn .
as a life-long new yorker 
i vote for the lower east side .
and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latino .
they lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave .
some interaction with non-latino might have created some excitement 
interest 
or tension .
remember west side story ? and now for the oft-criticized cinematography .
i do not know
if it was my tv or what ,
but all the indoor shot looked very orange to me .
the apt 
the furniture 
and the faces were all orange .
what was that supposed to mean ?
and the apt .
did look pretty cramped to me .
somebody here mentioned
that the old apt's/tenement had very big room .
well 
maybe 50 year ago .
what landlord have done is to eak up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small one and squeeze as many immigrant
as they can into them .
and another annoying thing ... .this is the second family movie i
have seen and criticized this week
that featured a teenage boy `` jerking off '' .
is this private sex act necessary for us to watch ?
please spare me !
what is up with these director ?
so `` victor vargas '' is a pleasant little movie .
it was nice for a change
to see young latino actor given a eak and a chance
to show their talent ,
which they did .
but the writer let them down ,
giving them a flat 
unspectacular script
to work with .
enjoy the show ,
but keep your finger near the `` fast forward '' button .
