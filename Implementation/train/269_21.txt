this is comedy
as it once was and comparing this with the two remake 
the money pit
and are we done yet ? ,
only points out all the more
how the 40 's movie maker had a flair for comedy
which has since 
regretfully ,
been lost.i was 15
when i first saw this and even at that tender age ,
there was much i could laugh at .
now of course being familiar with adult frustration ,
i see a whole lot
that i missed as a youth.the three main actor ... cary grant 
myrna loy 
and melvyn dougla ... interacted perfectly ,
but the core of the movie lies in the frustration encountered in achieving a dream .
it is never as easy and free of unseen complication as one envisions.all in all ,
this is a classic comedy
which still stands above the attempt
to remake it .
