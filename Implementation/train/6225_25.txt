made me wish my own happy bird could talk .
tisk tisk on the reviewer
who dissed the movie .
a sweet story
that person of all age will enjoy .
paulie is a lovable little treasure .
he has quite a few clever line
that truly made me laugh .
i especially loved the dance sequence during his showbiz stint .
you can forgive the obvious clich\u00e9s
as you cheer him on in his quest
to be reunited with marie .
a charming movie featuring two strong character
who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner .
would have liked to have seen more of the woman
who becomes blind
and must abandon their mutual journey .
i liked her artistic and poetic inspiration 
a shame
she could not share paulie 's reunion .
bless paulie in his new home 
at last with marie 
perhaps joined by the nice young man
who helped him defeat the antagonist
to complete his journey .
