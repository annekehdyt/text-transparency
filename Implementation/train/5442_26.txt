i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the wind at an age
when that tone of story was too serious for me .
laputa ,
whose title seems to have affected its release in the u.s.
to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audience ,
has the cartoonish knack of the director 's debut production conan .
in fact 
pazu has the thick bone and immortal vitality of conan
-- who jumped off a thousand story
carrying his girl in his arm
and landed on his foot ,
then started running .
this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch .
the techie fan of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bug and the retro technology through out laputa
-- the only exception may be the robot .
unlike princess mononoke and valley of the wind 
the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism .
if it has a theme at all
it is anti-warfare .
the importance of living naturally
-- this is related with the flying castle ,
is dismissably shortly discussed ,
and not really followed through .
overall 
i now regard the piece
as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny .
