carly pope plays jj 
a newly promoted food critic
whose flamboyant ,
overbearing mother move in with her .
jj 
aghast at this turn of event 
then blackmails restaurant owner 
alex 
to entertain her mother in exchange for `` maybe ''
reviewing his dying restaurant .
alex predictably falls for the daughter
while warming to the mother .
there are numerous problem with this movie ,
the character are universally 2-dimensional .
jj is a self-serving 
hateful character 
her mother superficial and shallow .
jj 's colleague at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic .
the underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own ,
without male assistance is bad 
bad 
bad .
the acting is uniformly dull 
the script uninspired .
the film only saving grace
is the setting of new york city .
i would so not recommend this film .
