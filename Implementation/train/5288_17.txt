come on person .
this movie is better
than 4. i can see this happening ...
wealthy person have done crazier thing than this .
and it was funny.i watch a comedy
to be entertained 
escape from the pressure of the world for a short while ,
and not to have to take anything too seriously .
this movie fully suit
that purpose .
i judge a movie on its own merit and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddle .
i watched totally dysfunctional person grow into caring 
likable individual
who could easily live down the street from my home .
it will remain on my list of `` favorite ... ..must watch for the holiday season '' .
if you just want to have a fun 90 minute 
watch this one .
