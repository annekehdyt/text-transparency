... ... in a horror movie that is .
alright first off 
lets start with kate .
her main goal include getting laid by george clooney ,
looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over .
got ta love her .
she had about 3 amazingly good chance
to finish off this sicko but ... ..
instead she ran .
i mean she did not wan na ing guy out for 10 minute
and when she did it was too late .
i mean the guy tried to rape her .
i can not get into these movie
where the main character is a sad idiot .
i mean
who honestly
would have any sympathy for a guy
who finishes off everyone
she has meet in a night .
the movie kept going on .
and as a result lost all its credibility .
