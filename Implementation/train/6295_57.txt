while watching this movie ,
i came up with a script for a movie ,
called `` the making of 10 item or less '' :
producer :
i have got good news and bad news .
the good news is ,
we can get morgan freeman ! writer :
that is great !
but what is the bad news ? producer :
we can only afford to hire him for one day .
i guess
we will have to get someone else.writer :
so we hire him for one day .
a movie is an hour and a half long .
a work day is eight hour long .
i fail to see a problem.producer :
but ... he will have to spend time
getting into character.writer :
so we have him play a character
who is essentially himself.producer :
but he will still need to understand his motivation and all that .
you are not saying
we have him play a big-name actor
that is doing a low-budget movie ,
are you ? writer :
why not ? producer :
that is ridiculous !
but fine 
at least we will have morgan freeman in our movie .
and i guess
we have to set the movie in los angele too.writer :
of course.producer :
this script is a load of crap .
we 'd better make money on this .
just in case 
have morgan freeman 's character plug wal-mart or target or one of those store ,
so at least someone will want to sell the dvds.writer :
sure thing ! producer :
wait a second ... what is this about a tiny bodega with a `` ten item or less '' express lane ? writer :
oh 
i guess
that is pretty weird .
but we can not change the title now ! i doubt
my script actually bears much resemblance to reality ,
but then neither did `` 10 item or less '' .
this is a case of good acting 
but bad writing ,
and i hate to see it happen .
when watching an independent movie ,
you expect it to try to convey some sort of message .
i think
they might have been trying for the tired old `` do not let anything hold you back '' message
that has been done to death in much better film .
in any case 
with `` 10 item or less '' 
the only message i got was `` look !
look at morgan freeman ! ''
