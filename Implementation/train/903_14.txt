this mess is so bad
it does not even qualify as horror .
debbie rochon 's talent is completely wasted in this film .
she is not even the villain .
the rest of the actor look like porno wannabe and the plot is so lame i will not even mention it.do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits
to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform `` better than sex ''
it is total 80 's disco candy song .
nice up tempo song about gambleing and sex .
way more entertaining than `` bleed '' .
put it this way ,
when one has the equipment
to copy video ,
but decides only to record the song at the end of movie ,
you have a really `` bad '' movie .
