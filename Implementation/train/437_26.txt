the 1960 's tv series bewitched owes
it is idea from this movie .
this is the movie
that jimmy stewart and kim novak made right
after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock .
this one is not as obsessive
as that one but novak is just
as captivating.this was jack lemmon 10th movie
and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs .
the movie has a lot of good thing about it .
hermine gingold is very good in this movie 
almost as good in support here
as she was in the music man .
the cast is very solid.this movie has a late 1950 's new york city feel and a cat
that is as hexing as any feline in any movie .
it is well worth
watching
as it is a love story with all the emotion of any ,
and a little magic too boot.it is not vertigo but i think
because it followed that movie 
viewer then did not rate it as good
as it deserved - sure am glad
that william asher saw it ,
so that the 1960 's series got created .
i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen ,
this movie is much better than that .
