i really like this show .
i can readily see how it achieved cult status .
it is original ,
and thought provoking .
for some reason though 
i have never felt the kind of resonance from it
that i could have .
it does not pack the kind of open door 
winter chill
that was to be had from such an awesome premise .
each time i watch an episode 
i find myself prodding ,
and pushing for it to answer some nameless 
formless question.before continuing 
let me preface this
by saying
that what follows is my opinion ,
and my opinion only .
different stroke for different folks.i would have liked to have seen more scene in `` american gothic ''
that were shot at night .
there is too much daylight in this show ,
and i think
it had a tendency to counteract the suspense .
we are not afraid of the daylight 
after all .
we are concerned about what is in the shadow .
the devil is not always in the detail .
what we are not seeing
is often the most frightening.second
-- and this is the one
that is probably going to lead to tar 
and feather :
gary cole is a tremendously talented actor ... a character actor .
i have followed his career from the brady bunch film on ,
which is why it pains me to say
that he was probably miscast as lucas buck .
he is almost too petroichan 
too likable to be embodiment of evil 
even by biblical standard .
lucas buck is a narcotic .
he is heroin .
he is freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain-o .
you keep going back ,
even though you know the end will be madness 
and death .
he should be like the ultimate loan shark .
he is a maker of book 
but also of unspeakable condemnation .
sure .
you have got the money ,
and before long you are also going to have oken finger ; a severed hand 
a decapitated head 
and eventually 
a damned soul .
turning to buck is an act of desperation ,
and whenever he is around ,
there should be some immediate 
ambient finality
-- with interest compounded daily --
in the air.it is all largess 
all string attached ,
and by the time you realize
that 
you will also know
that it is too late.which leads me to three :
they showed buck a little too often .
he is in most of the scene 
in fact ,
which may have caused him to lose his edge .
the sheriff would be like the next door mythology .
he is the apocryphal acquaintance .
many would know 'of ' him ,
but only an unfortunate few would really know him .
he had be the stuff of flashback 
and cryptic conversation 
and the perfect person
to deliver this plot exposition
would have been the deputy character
that nick searcy portrayed.four 
the show could be very self-reverential
-- to a fault 
some might say --
and this is typified by the whistling of `` meet me at the fishing hole '' in the series pilot .
i think
we have already established that what cassidy 
and raimi were shooting for was the anti-andy taylor .
we probably did not need the concept delivered
to us via fed ex .
i gathered
that within the first five minute so 
for me 
the piano on the head was unnecessary.these remark are all about what 
for me 
would have made a good show great .
i also understand
that the producer had their own 
unique style ,
and that there were many hand in the soup .
in their everlasting quest for lcd programming 
the network played a definite role in the demise of this series.the
least these jerk-off suit could have done
was to air the episode in order.get real.either way ,
it is a grievous loss to both genre fan 
and casual viewer alike .
