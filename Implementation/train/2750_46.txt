*********ten out of ten stars********* it is hard to believe
this was a made for television movie .
just the phrase 
`` made of tv '' 
makes me shudder .
the production value
for made for tv movie
are almost always remarkably lower than production value for professional movie studio .
that
being said ,
this version of the `` christmas carol '' should have been released in theater ,
because it is that good .
it is my personal favorite of all the `` christmas carol '' movie
because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality .
yes 
there are some minor on screen glitch with two of the ghost
that visit scrooge ,
but there is not a movie in existence
that does not have at least a couple of mistakes.scott turn in a stellar performance as scrooge ,
he is a pleasure to watch .
in fact 
i can not think of one performance in this film
that should not be applauded .
the costuming 
location shooting 
and winter backdrop are mesmerizing .
the musical score is endearing and heart warming .
add to that 
solid directing 
flawless cinematography 
and faithful scripting ;
we have here
what will one day be considered a holiday classic .
it really has not been around long enough
to be a classic 
but mark my word 
one day soon it will be .
this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home
because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas :
love 
selflessness 
and giving .
in as selfish 
greedy world 
my family and i can lose ourselves in `` the christmas carol '' ,
starring george c. scott .
