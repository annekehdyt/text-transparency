any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell
that numerous film about a young girl
having trouble with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.if such a film
is shown to person again ,
it would surely click provided
if it has something new 
fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audience .
this is also true for german film maker sylke ender
as her film 's principal protagonist kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her
including her mother and boyfriend.she is bold enough
to face any punishment
as she has tried her hand at all kind of criminal activity
including shoplifting.kroko was originally shot on dv to be blown afterward to 35 mm format.it technical virtuosity does not hamper our joy
when we learn
that kroko would like to become a policeman
as she feels
that she is averse to the idea
of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.if someone were to state a positive aspect of sylke ender ' film ,
it may well be kroko 's involvement with handicapped person
as a result of a punishment.it is with kroko
that we learn
that punk are human too with their unique joy and sorrow .
