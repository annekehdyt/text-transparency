i watched this film
not really expecting much ,
i got it in a pack of 5 film ,
all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver
so what could i expect ?
and you know
what i was right ,
they were all terrible ,
this movie has a few
( and a few is stretching it )
interesting point 
the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch 
the drummer is very like a drummer 
i.e damned annoying and 
well thats about it actually 
the problem is that its just so boring 
in what i can only assume was an attempt
to build tension 
a whole lot of nothing happen
and when it does its utterly tedious
( i had my thumb on the fast forward button 
ready to press for most of the movie ,
but gave it a go )
and seriously is the lead singer of the band
that great looking 
coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot ,
i thought
he looked a bit like a meercat ,
all this and i have not even mentioned the killer ,
i am not even gon na go into it ,
its just not worth explaining .
anyway as far as i am
concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london
( who was actually quite funny )
it was not because of their acting talent ,
i have certainly seen a lot worse ,
but i have also seen a lot better .
best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry .
