feature of early 21 century cinema of let pit different evil creature
and bad guy against each other .
we have not seen stuff like this since godzilla v king kong and the like .
always sound great on paper
when you are splicing up
and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea
and see the whole playing out
before you like beethoven 's symphony .
then you come to writing it .
great idea like all vampire are female .
ergo hot 
seductive deadly but in a way i want to perish sort of way .
and all zombie are man .
well thats what man are like to a woman
just after sh been dumped or cheated on right ?
so it all looks good up to actually making it .
then the rot starts to set in .
moster have fight .
nothing much happen .
another fight .
philosophical noodling and cod wallop .
eureka we have found how to win .
big fight again and the end .
sound great does not it ?
if it was made an indie company
it would be great .
but this is hollywood with the eye on the buck :
gloss instead of what the fan want .
it all could have been gore soaked beautiful .
