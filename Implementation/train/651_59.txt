i only saw it once .
this happened in 1952 
i was seven ,
the movie 13.we were so young ...
but i kept in mind 
forever ,
the strong moment of gunga 's sacrifice.i realized
that time
how much a person
can be hardly submitted
and used by a foreign nation .
under these historical circumstance 
in the movie 
the personal relation of friendship 
a kind of friendship
that ignores itself ,
the one raised between person
who share daily life ,
who see each other faces ,
who knows each other name ,
but belong to different world ,
can only make appears .
then 
in the most critical moment a troubling question emerges :
`` whom are we ,
in first 
supposed to be loyal ?
`` ,
which person 
family 
motherland 
the person
you know close to you ? .
you do not have time
to give a perfect answer ,
urgency is there ,
and it is for life or death .
gunga-din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself .
somewhere 
in a confuse manner 
a problem remains unsolved 
the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dy 
just one life 
nothing compared to so many other fiction or reality
we can see today ,
because this death ,
this unique vanishing life i lived it ,
i shared with my child unconditional friendship .
it was lived by the spectator i was .
that day i loose gunga-din for ever .
as i left behind 
later 
my pretty childhood 
as i left from then so many world i
lived in .
i left all
that for good and these line are today a short visit i
did not expect to do this morning
when getting up .
