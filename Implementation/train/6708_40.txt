this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problem with this play
to begin with .
but first the movie 
it is a typical tv movie version of a play
which means it does not have the flair of the original film version with william holden .
what they could not afford to hire more than twelve person as extra ?
why move the movie up to 1966 ?
so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protest ?
why not 1963
and give her a line about the civil right movement ?
as for the casting ,
some hit some miss .
jay o. sander hit the right note for his character especially with his scene with josh brolin .
brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the note .
he is believable as an ex-bmoc jock
but he does not have the raw sensuality of william holden .
i always thought
brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla
to have all the woman in town go ape over him
( pardon the pun ) .
gretchen moll was lovely
but she seemed a little too wise for the character
she played .
she did not project the innocence or ignorance
that the character required .
maybe it is because she and brolin were about 5 year older
than the character should be .
but then again holden was ten year too old .
bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable
as the mother and mary steenburgen can not seem to make up her mind
whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from `` the taming of the shrew '' .as for mr. inge 's play ,
i always felt
that story like this of a young woman
choosing passion over practicality
always needed an epilogue .
`` the twilight zone '' i believe
offer a likely epilogue with the episode 
`` spur of the moment ''
where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland ,
because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter .
