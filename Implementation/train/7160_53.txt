i can honestly
say
i never expected this movie to be good .
i do not like family film .
i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor .
the director 's last movie
( mpkdh
was complete stupidity .
and the music was very boring and bland .
but there was amrita rao ,
who has become my favorite after main hoon na .
there was also seema biswas 
alok nath 
and anupam kher
who are very talented .
so a few plus points.i finally saw
the movie and i was very impressed .
he ings us the young lover of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding ,
and we have a winner .
the story outline is similar to hahk 
light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end .
the director also made character
that you could relate to .
the thing i did not like about hahk was
that the character were too eccentric .
the casting adds to its perfection .
shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance .
this is a major improvement ,
and most importantly he suit the role .
the best is easily amrita rao .
in fact 
this is her best performance .
her screen presence is so electrifying ,
you are bound to love her performance .
sameer soni 
amrutha prakash 
anupam kher 
alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast .
not one actor feels out of place .
the song were quite disappointing
but they will sound better
after watching them .
mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballad .
milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching .
the song are not colorful and dancey ,
and they are more like ballad .
the exception is hamari shaadi mein
which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk .
so what was the flaw in the movie ?
the movie gets quite slow ,
and the ending is quite stretched .
but the movie is still goes at a good pace ,
making it a perfect family film .
