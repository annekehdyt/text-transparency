slow 
incomprehensible 
boring .
three enthusiastic word
that describe the movie of the book .
this is surely a case
where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book .
the best part of the movie was the scenery 
excellent .
the worst part was the slow moving interaction of the actor
which combined with endless meaningful glance .
the editing is aupt and patchy .
however ,
despite this ,
the actor worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script .
it was startling that although set in peru there was hardly a person of peruvian descent wandering about the set - even in the flashback scenes
depicting peru in the 17th century .
if you have any sense of history ,
try to avoid this movie .
