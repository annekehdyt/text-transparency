***spoilers*** ***spoilers***
when i saw a preview for this movie i
thought
it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline .
but as most superstation original movie i was left disapointed .
this gullible family ends up driving through this `` deserted '' town
to take a ake
and find this video camera
showing these person
doing everything their donig
and finds out
they all eventually disappear ,
the family goes through all these mysterious stage
and never discover or display what the heck is stalking them .
their are more gap than i can count
and they do not explain anything
that happens how or what .
it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or ainwashed or something
( which is never explained ) .
the next thing you know
ur hoping
they somehow find out how all it happened
but it ends leaving you completely confused .
