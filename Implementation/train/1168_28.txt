i happily admit
that i am a sucker for a beautiful film ,
and sufficiently inventive camera movement and angle can be enough
to keep my interest in a fairly long film .
not one the length of gojoe though ,
even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i have seen since the korean period piece musa .
however 
gojoe provides far more than just beautiful image
( as does musa ... do not which to imply a contrast ) -
it is second greatest strength is superb acting 
and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy .
i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end ,
but it definitely provokes some thought along the way .
vague one 
but definitely thought :
pone department
in which the film could have been better
is the action .
there is a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film ,
but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-up ,
and frequently obscured by object in the foreground .
it does create some very intense and impressive visual ,
but it would have been nice to see some more actual move ,
something to make it more believable
that the villain could just wade through entire army
laying waste to everyone.still ,
the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful film i have seen for quite some time .
recommended !
