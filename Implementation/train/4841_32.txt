ivan
( valeri nikolayev )
is a bitter 
cynical journalist
who investigates the unexplained .
he travels to this small town
where it is said
that a witch
( ita ever )
is terrorizing the community.his car stall
and he takes refuge in a small building ,
and meets a beautiful 
mysterious girl .
suddenly
she turns into a demon
and he kills her ,
and the town is wondering
who murdered this woman ...
who i guess was the witch
but i am not entirely sure .
ivan is now being pursued by her spirit 
or something ,
and he has to have faith 
or something 
to beat it.i really hate christian film .
they are usually filled with lame actor 
stupid storyline and minimal effect .
not to mention
that this is not just a christian film ... but a foreign one as well .
the voice-over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing ,
because it is so high pitched and whiny .
you will not miss much by missing out on this film .
