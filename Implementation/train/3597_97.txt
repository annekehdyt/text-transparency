well 
awful is just the first name .
this movie is a clich\u00e9-ridden piece of junk .
a high school comedy setup in a military training camp .
i am sorry i had to give this 1 star
which it did not deserve.this may contain spoiler :
just about everything is totally forced 
unconvincing and unrealistic .
the hepo
( military police )
will not come to get you
if you do not make your appearance 
especially not on your wedding day .
the actor were pretty embarrassed during this scene ,
because the scene did not work
as it was so highly unlikely .
you can sense it in their voice .
even if they were not such bad actor ,
they would not have been able to save the scene .
next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit .
no 
there was no time
to get him an uniform first .
man 
this is great cinematography !
i will remember this scene for the rest of my life.there are also girl in the camp
-- exciting --
one of'em even a model ,
though not looking that great --
and the baddest actress i have ever seen .
i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie .
okay girl in the military !
now this is getting fun .
the girl are even placed on the same floor ,
so we can sneak to their room at night !
in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away 
separated by two fence with barbed wire .
there are tank available
we can use for a fun ride in our spare time ,
of which we have plenty .
no 
the tank are not locked ,
and the ignition key are inserted .
no one will notice the engine sounds ,
especially not at night.there is a bunch of sex scene
and reference and all are below the waste line .
we need those
so the sexually obsessed german will like the movie as well .
switzerland is too small a market for any feature film .
well done !
one sex scene takes place in the kitchen .
surely 
none of those facility are ever locked .
the military routine are as sloppy
as they can get.in the end of the ainless flick ,
the mafia hit man are about the take revenge on the poor guy
trying to shoot him !
because he deserted his fianc\u00e9e !
sure i buy that ,
the italian are that way
-- a jealous bunch
( not ) .
the bad guy attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitness .
not at night in a dark alley .
again 
military training ground
( where there is shooting with live ammo )
are open to the public ,
anyone can freely drive or walk in there .
there are no such thing as guard or fence .
the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely
launching a rocket into the italian ' car .
the explosion knocks the hit man and the enraged fianc\u00e9e off their foot .
no one in 40 foot distance is hurt
when the car is blown to smithereen .
it is a comedy 
remember.okay .
it is a comedy ,
i got that ,
and i can live with that .
no realism needed .
filmmaker can easily get way with this
if it is hilariously 
side splitting funny 
or entertaining 
interesting 
challenging .
unfortunately it is none of those .
it is just embarrassing .
a rip-off from ainless american comedy .
the latter are at least done professionally ,
with no amateur actor.it is pretty boring and predictable 
a waste of time and energy 
especially to those
sitting through the entire movie
as i unfortunately did .
yawn .
