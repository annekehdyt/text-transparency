average viewer
looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film
should probably give this one a pass .
it generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual image
that seem to have some relationship one to another ,
but never coalesce into a totality.while this isolative approach
to creating a kind of cinematic montage
may appeal to a few student or critic steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking ,
it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoner
who just fell off the haywagon .
an overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteur like kar-wai wong and tarantino ,
but to me it comes across
as andy warhol warmed over .
the only redeeming characteristic i find is in the production value ,
and them there just are not going to cut it all by themselfs.this is one of those production
in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea
or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scene .
sorry .
the calligraphic credit unexpectedly begin to roll
just as your interest begins to stir .
i get the same big yawn and let-down reading
what i guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comment about this film
that never lead to anything truly comprehensible .
idea and image
without some external context are not my idea of fun.call me a philistine roaming the street of hong kong
looking for a bowl of chop suey .
