high heel are tricksy thing .
they can elevate woman
( or cross-dressing man )
to newfound height ,
put forward a sharp statemant of style and ing a touch of fragile elegance .
alternatively 
they can be a perilous foot pain
that will inevitably lead to trip 
fall and ultimate tragedy .
tacone lejano is more of a disappointmant trip
than a stylish high riser.almod\u00f3var 's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure ,
but in term of plot it is a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing 
complex character
that never fully engage or make sense .
a few momants of comedy aside 
tacone lejano just is not interesting .
the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macae case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child .
from this illiant bit of black comedy thing are looking up ,
but then the film comes to a heel.there is solid enough acting performance
and there is some stylish 
arty direction
that you would expect from almod\u00f3var ,
but otherwise tacone lejano is not an impressive piece of spanish cinema .
with a story of murder 
showbiz 
femininity 
fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character
who is alternately a judge ,
a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse .
instead it is poor .
high heel stumble for sure .
