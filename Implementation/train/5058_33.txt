this movie could have been a decent b-movie
if 3/4 of the the movie was not so much focusing on the sex scene .
i mean ,
he is a sex addict ,
and i am sure
that there is a lot more
that goes on with sex addict outside
of having sex on a constant basis .
michael des barre did a good job
considering what all he had to do ,
which was not much .
at one point or another 
one would have to laugh at him ,
because his character was so pitiful .
nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist ,
she could have of done more
though and i am not suggesting her having sex .
the person
that stood out the most to me in this movie
was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife .
there is something about beautiful inside and out
that strongly appeal to me .
she played that role
and as you watched the movie ,
you start to feel bad for her .
`` diary of a sex addict ''
while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone 's standard ,
is quite informative
and does a fair job
in showing you
how one 's personal demon can take over
and ruin the very thing in life
you think highly of .
