i usually like zombie movie ,
but this one was just plain bad.the good part :
girl swimming topless with thong bottom 
sonya salomaa 's topless 
and ona grauer 's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top
when she ran.the bad part :
too much video cut ,
too much matrix slow motion
( it drags the action ) ,
not enough blood and gut 
bad acting 
and no story .
the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene .
a total waste of $ 6 and time .
i give it a 2/10 .
