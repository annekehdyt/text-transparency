i just finished watching this movie .
it was not ridiculously bad ,
but i am really disappointed with it .
i am not really sure
why someone would make a movie like this .
it was marginally entertaining ,
but i feel like the person
making it had a lot of disagreement on what
they were making .
monday 
the writer was in charge ; tuesday 
the director ; wednesday 
the guy
who gets the coffee ; etc .
it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movie ,
but only had the time and money
to make one.someone else commented
that the acting was really good ,
but i would have to disagree .
then again ,
if the actor were able to keep a straight face during the filming ,
perhaps they are better actor than i give them credit for.the back of the dvd gives the impression
that the movie would be a mystery ...
something along the line of a historical law and order or national treasure .
it starts off like that ,
but then 
out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone ,
or ...
what was that other show
that was not as good ... a bad episode of the outer limits.my main complaint about the movie is
that it is just so played out .
there is the evil guy with spiked white hair .
there is the love interest ,
who ,
when she first appears ,
the wind actually blows through her hair .
seriously .
once you realize
it is a christian movie ,
the end is also pretty easy to spot.the cinematography was poorly done 
especially in the opening scene - way to put your best foot forward .
it was not atrocious for most of the movie ,
but there was the occasional ridiculously bad
shot of an old lady 
praying ,
arm up in a dark room
while lightening is striking - the sort of thing
that just makes you a little bit embarrassed
to be watching the movie .
