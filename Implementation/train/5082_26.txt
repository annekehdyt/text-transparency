if derivative and predictable rape-revenge thriller are your thing ,
then you are in for a rare treat ...
they do not really appeal to me ,
so i could not find any single thing
to redeem this peculiar tale .
it seems like something straight out of the 1980s 
a different age
when this would have gone straight to video .
gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario .
but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the illiance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year ?
the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentary ,
but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene
where a pack of rural hound beat up dyer .
i do not think
i was the only person in the cinema laughing .
what i can not understand is the involvement of the company behind this film - filmfour and verve picture .
both have been involved in some great independent british film in recent year .
verve distributed bullet boy 
code 46 and red road - straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned in the same eath .
filmfour and verve take note :
is this really the best
you can do ?
what are independent british filmmaker going to make of your artistic judgement ?
it is a big blot on both of your reputation .
listen carefully :
can you hear the thousand of fan of independent british film crying in despair ?
