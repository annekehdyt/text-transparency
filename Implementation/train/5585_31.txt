you believe in god or you do not .
you believe in jesus or you do not .
you believe
he is the son of god
or you do not .
the choice is up to you.director denys arcand
has really done everything
he could to ing back jesus to a mere historic figure 
social worker 
son of two human 
instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary ,
who opened heaven again for us .
encouraging the big bang 
a world come from evolution ,
instead of seeing the beauty of creation .
the film depicts a theologian inging some `` modern finding '' to the actor
who plays jesus in the passion play ,
who happily incorporates them in his play.the depicted priest
who runs the sanctuary
where the passion play is performed in montreal
has a sexual relation with one of the female player of the passion play
instead of showing his love for god through celibacy .
more often than not the director 's abhorrence of the church is clearly
visible.the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus ' life and the passion play actor 's life .
this is an admirable attempt ,
but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor 's organ in other body signifies
how the director thinks
about jesus.my opinion is not important ,
god 's opinion is ,
but i would not want to stand in the shoe of the director and actor
when standing before jesus ' throne .
