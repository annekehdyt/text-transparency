let me put it another way :
ball .
or 
how about bollo*ks .
this is truly awful 
more embarrassing
than those
it attempts to satirise .
julia robert is a skilled actress ,
and usually her work is of the highest standard .
this movie is so lacking in direction
even she struggles to look proficient .
normally she is the consummate professional 
yet i swear
that in her eye 
there were sign of bewilderment and despair.the one thing
that might have rescued this move
was the idea about the director
( chris walken )
turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actor .
unfortunately 
that theme was not explored to it is full potential .
too little 
too late.zeta jone was wooden ,
cusack was cusack ,
and crystal should stick to acting .
the two talented ex-buffy star had different experience
- green hopelessly mis-cast 
and balfour under-used .
well done to julia for just about preventing this
from being the worst movie ever made .
