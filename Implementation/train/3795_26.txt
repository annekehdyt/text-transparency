this movie is really genuine and random .
it is really hard to find movie like it in bunch of movie now in hollywood .
i really enjoy watching this movie ,
i bought its dvd tuesday this week
and i have watched it for 4 time .
i love the spanglish accent of paz ,
it s just really cute as she is .
and her acting and morgan 's are so funny
and natural.my movie taste might be really different from other
but i have to say i really love this movie 
the simple is the best ! i have learned something more about life from this movie
( well 
or at least usa 's life ) ... life is really random ... sometime 
u meet someone ,
they pass by your life
and be your friend coincidently ,
and u do not spend so much time with them ,
maybe just a while
but u enjoy that ''while '' with them 
and then u and them will never meet each other again ,
but the time u are together is really unforgettable .
just keep those moment in your mind
as grateful and nice memory ... this movie might be cheap in the making price
but its meaning are totally not cheap .
i rarely can learn anything from movie ,
but this is an exception .
