well 
maybe not immediately before the rodney king riot ,
but even a few month before was timely enough .
my parent said
that they saw it and the next thing you know ,
the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground .
it just goes to show the state of race relation in america .
the plot has white mack
( kevin kline )
and african-american simon
( danny glover )
becoming friend after simon saves mack 's life in the black ghetto .
meanwhile 
movie producer davis
( steve martin in a serious role )
thinks
that gratuitous violence is really cool ...
until he gets shot .
there is also some existentialism in the movie :
mack and his family come to realize
that they are not living
as they really want.it seems
that `` crash '' has somewhat renewed person 's interest in race relation ,
but this one came out much earlier .
maybe we will never be able to have stable race relation in this country .
but either way 
`` grand canyon '' is a great movie .
it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor .
also starring mary mcdonnell 
mary-louise parker and alfre woodard .
