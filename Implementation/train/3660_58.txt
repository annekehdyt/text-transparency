i sometimes enjoy really lousy movie ... .those
that occasionally result when person
( even talented person )
get together with good intention
to produce a movie and for whatever reason
it turns out to be a disaster .
movie like `` attack of the killer tomato '' 
`` plan 9 from outer space '' 
`` manos-hand of fate '' 
and `` heaven gate '' 
etc.so ,
when i heard
that this movie 
`` rachel 's attic '' 
was considered by many person
to be the single worst film of the decade ,
naturally i just had to see it.boy ,
do i regret that decision .
this movie is beyond bad ...
.it is so bad
that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie .
the acting 
filming 
script 
etc .
are even worse than a low budget porno film :
the sound is utterly horrible ,
the `` plot '' is completely incomprehensible ,
the `` acting '' is laughable ... .it is a complete waste of everyone 's time and money .
at least the porno film has porno to eak up the monotony ,
while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy
squeezing a rotten apple ,
and a `` mad hatter 's '' tea party.the lighting is non-existent ...
many `` scene '' take place in semi or complete darkness ,
which is probably just as well .
the `` writer-director ''
( i use the term loosely ) ,
david tybor ,
try to get kinky with bondage scene ...
but the result would be laughable ,
if they were not so pathetic .
there is some nudity ,
but it is of such abysmal quality
that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant .
i could go on forever
and not do justice to all the flaw and shortcoming of this truly awful waste of film.for the love of god ,
avoid this train wreck .
i know
that despite
( or perhaps because of )
my negative comment ,
you may still be tempted to see
if this piece of trash is really as bad
as i claim it to be ... .but trust me on this ... .it is even worse than i have said ,
and you will absolutely ,
positively regret the experience
( and expense ,
if you waste your money on a purchase or rental ) .
