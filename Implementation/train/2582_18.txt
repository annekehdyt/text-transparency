actually i liked this movie very 
very much .
not because of it` plot 
acting 
joke 
no .
i liked it ,
because it` one of the worse movie ever created .
it` so lame 
so bad ,
that it becomes terribly funny .
some joke are actually cool ,
but the rest makes me pray for unemploymant for the scriptwriter .
`` man in white '' are so dumb and stupid ,
that you can do only two thing .
turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing
( beer helps a lot : ) .
i chose the second option .
