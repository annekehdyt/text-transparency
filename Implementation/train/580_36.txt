a movie made for contemporary audience .
the mass get to see what they want to see .
action 
comedy 
drama and of course sensuous scene as well .
this is not exactly a movie
that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family .
it is not for eye of child .
i had to fast forward quite a number of scene.if
it is just entertainment you are looking for ,
then this movie has it all .
the song are catchy .
a lavish production 
i must add.however ,
the message of the movie is not universal .
it emphasizes on the idea of karma .
that is ,
if you do good ,
you will get good .
and if you do evil ,
you will get evil .
the fruit of good deed is good ,
while the fruit of evil is evil .
in real life 
this is not always true .
it is well-known that most person do not get justice in this world .
while it is true that some evil person do meet with an evil end ,
there are many
who escape .
and then 
there are many person
who do good ,
and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.if
you do not care about the message ,
and all you want is an escape from worldly reality ,
this movie is an entertainer alright .
