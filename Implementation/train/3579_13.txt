this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood history.this 1994 blockbuster
had all of it good performance 
music and direction.i remember i was in allahabad
when this movie was running
and it was somewhere in march at holi time ,
the person there were playing its song `` ooe amma '' at their loudspeaker in highest volume .
if someone
who likes to watch some like it hot and drools over marilyn monroe
he should see this movie.thumbs up to govinda.how many of you know
that this film was shot in south of india
and after sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter
to hit silver screen.with film
like these indian comedy could never be dead .
