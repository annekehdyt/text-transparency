what a great film it is .
the notion of nation sending person
fighting each other with giant robot is tacky .
the ending is not just a fitting one ,
it is more inspirational.but i am intrigued by the character .
it is a pity
we never see the relationship of achille and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kiss and athena 's fear for achille 's safety .
their romance is very enjoyable .
