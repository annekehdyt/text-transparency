i was so impressed with doug mcgrath 's film version of the jane austen novel `` emma 
''
and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much ,
that
when i went to the video store one day
and discovered the two had re-united for `` nicholas nickleby '' i
immediately rented it
without any other consideration.i have read the book ,
and for those overly-critical fan of this jane austen adaptation 
i do not know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot element of miss austen 's work ,
especially given the limitation of a two hour movie
( which some have complained about being too long ! ) .
and as far as gwen paltrow 's accent is concerned ,
i must confess i was not too familiar with her
when i saw this at the theater initially ,
and i was absolutely convinced at the time
that she was an english actress ! i am
taken aback by those
who criticized the film for its lush scenery .
that is one of the thing i enjoy
and look forward to seeing in period piece
set in the english countryside .
the film 's beautiful background are a major contributor to its appeal and success .
if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker ,
then perhaps you should rent something like `` death wish iii !
`` the english country setting are as attractive and charming as the cast ,
and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment
that makes you not tire of repeat viewing .
mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expression
that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue
that occurs in this story.this refreshing movie could also be a clinic
on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex 
violence or even a villainous antagonist .
the story is often amusing 
endearing ,
and at time 
quite touching.i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptation
but this is without question my favorite .
