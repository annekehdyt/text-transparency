call me stupid ,
but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie 
valentine .
it was so well-made 
well-written 
well-acted 
well-directed 
etc !
everything about it was wonderful !
there were part
that were relatively routine
( lily 's death ) ,
very funny
( www.bleed-me-dry.com ) ,
completely horrifying and creepy
( paige 's death ) ,
and just plain hearteaking
( the first scene ) .
i think
the entire cast did a great job 
especially the three lead :
david boreanaz 
denise richard
( both of whom i met ,
and got autographs from 
during the filming of this movie - very nice person !
) 
and marley shelton.i am very sick of person
calling this movie `` another scream clone '' .
this movie is 
in no way 
a scream clone .
in fact 
this film runs ring around scream .
it actually makes sense !
scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it .
excuse me ,
but it looks like scream was also a clone too
( ahem ... ,
friday the 13th 
halloween 
and many other scary movie also featured masked killer ) .
i also think
that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is illiant .
it is so strange to see a sweet ,
cupid face doing all of these horrible thing .
another novelty
( the nose bleeding )
makes way for a fantastic ending !
the ending gives me chills every time i see it ! ! ! ! !
so ,
even if you did not like it the first time ,
watch valentine again
and give it another chance !
ps- keep an eye out for my new website
( www.love-hurts.org ) !
coming soon ...
