this is an `` odysessy through time '' via computer animation ,
supposedly th work of over 300 artist .
made in the late '80
and released in 1990 ,
this was cutting edge stuff for the day .
i thought
it was good
and quite interesting in spots.most of the short scene made no sense ,
just form evolving into other form ,
but that was fun to watch .
this is all about visual ,
not really about any kind of a story .
there were some strange sequence
in which odd-looking men- creature would dance around with bird overheard .
all of it is computer animated
which was new back then .
even the term `` computer animated '' was not well-known.it is simply a chance
to show off this new technology in short bit of cartoon-like happening with beautiful color and imaginative scene .
no word 
just picture with electronic music .
stoner must have really loved this.it is a nice 
intriguing 40 minute of `` eye candy '' and `` head candy . ''
by today 's cg effect this may have lost impact ,
but i think
you would still be entertained by this .
