this is indeed quite the strange movie ... first ,
we have an ex-u.s.-gymnast trying to turn actor
( or something ) ,
and this seems to be the only role
he ever got
( that i know of anyway )
-- and for good reason .
while he does pull off the role well enough
to keep some interest ,
it is a rather bland and flat performance .
second 
we have the worst ever sound effect
ever used in a movie ! ! !
i am not kidding .
this alone makes the movie extremely comical ,
but in that annoying way .
hehe and third ,
while we have a generally decent acting
supporting cast
( including the required hot chick !
) 
an actually not-so-bad story 
and some cool visual ; the dialogue 
fight scene
involving gymnastic
( hilarious !
) ,
and overall execution of the plot are weak .
this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie
( too bad fox was not around in 1985 ) .
it is one of those movie
that is simply bad ,
yet you can not resist watching and even enjoying it
once you get used to it ,
especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable .
