this is one of joan crawford 's best talky .
it was the first gable-crawford pairing ,
and made it evident to mgm
and to audience
that they were a sizzling team ,
leading the studio
to make seven more film with them as co-stars.the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a other and sister
who ,
after their father loses everything in the stock market crash ,
must fend for themselves and work for a living .
life is hard in the depression ,
and soon even their attempt at finding legitimate work prove futile ,
and they resort to underworld activity .
joan crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll .
she is smart 
complex 
and believable .
she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actor ' early talkie acting style .
clark gable is a diamond-in-the rough 
masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster
who becomes involved with crawford 's character .
the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in `` a free soul '' ,
securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm.if you like crawford in this type of role ,
do not miss `` paid '' ,
which she did a year earlier ,
which is also among her best early talkie performance .
