the more i think about it ,
there was nothing redeeming about thismovie .
i saw it 9 month ago ,
so my memory might have made itworse
than it was ,
but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of10 .
after seeing the movie ,
i met the director .
he seemed so cluelessas to what he was doing or what he had done ,
and as far as icould tell 
he did not care for the film either .
even he agreed
that hedid not really know what he was doing ,
and he was forced to docertain thing
because it was filmed digitally .
i felt
that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula
that itbuilt for itself :
`` 9 person all have to be connected in some way .
howcan we get from point 'a ' to point 'b ' ''
so in order get from theprostitute
we see in the start
and back to her at the end
they 10minutes on each character 's relationship to another person .
itmake one feel
choked by the 2 demensional ,
badly drawncharacters.i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie ...
stevebouchemi there is one scene
where he is amazing .
that is it .
as isay ... 4/10 .
