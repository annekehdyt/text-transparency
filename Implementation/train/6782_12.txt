what a piece of stupid tripe.i will not even waste time
evaluating any of the point of this show .
it is not worth the time .
the one comment i will make is -
why get such a dumb ,
inarticulate doofus to be the star ? !
? there are not many more dismal testimonial to the deteriorating mental condition of the network than the fact
that fox has stated
it will not ing back john doe
( a decent series )
but will ing back ain-dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the ain cell of the american public.fox has lost it 
imho .
