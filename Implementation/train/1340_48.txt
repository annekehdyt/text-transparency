this is one of the creepiest 
scariest and most hearteaking horror movie ever !
dr creed
( louise )
and his family moving in to new home with his wife
( rachel ) 
daughter
( ellie )
and little son
( gage )
everything seems normal until dr creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury 
then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life.louis not knowing
if that was all dream
and is talking to ellie who worried about her cat
that could be killed by lorry and then later on rachel tell louis
that it really hard for to talk about death
because of her sister zelda
who was really sick
( as we see in a flashback
how sick her sister really was
and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever ! )
the next day louis gets a call from jed saying
there cat
as been killed by lorry and jed take him to place
where victor the ghost told him not to go !
and bury the cat 
his wife and kid have go to see their grandparent and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back
and now it as evil in it eyes
so he goes to see jed then jed tell him
that he also buried his dog there too
( as we seen other flashback )
.later on in the movie the family out having picnic 
gage is playing with kite and gage say
's i drop it '' ,
the wind blow the rod near the road
where a lorry coming at fast past ,
gage is get closer to road ,
louis is rushing to get him ,
the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or shiver
will go down your back
when you hear louis scream ,
soon he missing him so much 
louis then bury gage in same place
where is buried the cat .
the scariest thing about this movie is that some scene in this movie are not too far from really life .
this movie is just amazing
and the acting from everyone was great !
