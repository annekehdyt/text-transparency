the biggest reason
i had to see this movie
was that it stars susan swift 
an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress .
time travel movie usually do not interest me
and neither do movie about witchcraft ,
but this movie was fascinating and creepy .
it did not rely on outrageous special effect
and it did not focus so heavily on the time travel
that the viewer gets lost and confused .
this was a really
creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all .
