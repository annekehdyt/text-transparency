in an attempt to ing back the teen slasher genre
that was taken away by spoof like scary movie and shriek
if you know
what i did last friday the 13th 
valentine fail .
why did person like halloween ?
because it was original ,
new and went beyond anything
that is ever been done .
why did they like scream ?
because at least it made sense .
valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick
that has hardly any gore what so-ever .
the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend
it is not funny .
and the moment the killer comes on screen ,
you know
who it is ,
it is just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable .
the teen slasher genre is dead get over it ! 0 out of 10
