jean claude van damme try to rescue his career
by making the sequel of universal soldier .
but 
did that movie saved him ?
i think he goes to hell ,
after he dies .
in the first minute 
we see the inside of a facility ,
where you can see the bad guy of the film .
scary 
huh ?
but not as scary as the acting
( detail are following ) .
then 
we see van damme with a black girl
( do not remember the name ... .well
it does not matter anyway ) ,
trying to escape from some muscle-man .
of course they are the new universal-soldier .
more muscel 
less ain
( just like the movie ) .
after a while 
van damme fight goldberg
but then the `` mission '' gets aborted .
it was just a test
( is this movie a test for our nerve ? ) .
it turns out
that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project
( who has seen the first movie
may think
that this is the most unlogical thing ,
that yould van damme character could do ) .
but it is a sequel .
and a `` story '' has to come up .
ah 
i forgot .
he has a daughter .
very important for the `` story '' .well 
after about 20 minute 
a super computer hears a conversation
about shutting it down and quitting
he project .
of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldier
to kill everyone .
van damme escape from the facility
but the computer sends some soldier hunting him
( it wants van damme as a soldier -
because he is the best
( really ? ) ) .
and guess what 
goldberg is one of the hunter ,
who was always a silly sentence for the audience
before he gets asskicked .
funny ?
yes 
just like the rest of the film .
after some `` story '' 
van damme try to rescue his daughter
( of his wife - the reporter in the first movie ) .
it comes to a final show down
where van damme fight the bad guy
and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie
( please see for yourself .
it is just too funny to tell )
.you will see
that this movie is a waste of time.so do not watch it .
but if you do ,
keep a sixpack with you !
