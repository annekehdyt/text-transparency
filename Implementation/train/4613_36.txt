a matter of life and death 
what can you really say
that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film .
powell and pressburger 's visual imagination knows no bound ,
every frame is filled with fantastically bold composition .
the switch between the bold colours of `` the real world '' to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious ,
showing us visually
just how much more viant life is .
the final court scene is also fantastic ,
as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter
( david niven )
's operation .
all of the performance are spot on
( roger livesey being a standout ) ,
and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful ,
never has there been a more romantic film than this
( if there has i
have not seen it ) .
a matter of life and death is all about the power of love
and just how important life is .
and jack cardiff 's cinematography is reason enough
to watch the film alone ,
the way
he lights kim hunter 's face makes her all the more beautiful 
what a genius 
he can make a simple thing such as a game of table tennis look exciting .
and the sound design is also impeccable ;
the way
the sound mutes at vital point was a decision way
ahead of its timethis is a true classic
that can restore anyone 's faith in cinema 
under appreciated on its initial release and by today 's audience 
but one of my all time favourite ,
which is why
i give this film a 10/10 
in a word - beautiful .
