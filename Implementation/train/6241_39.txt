meek 
tiny 
almost insignifican not .
polanski finds the invisibility of his character
and makes something enormous out of it .
in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpiece i
had the pleasure
to see and see and see again .
it never let 's me down .
person 
even person
who know me pretty well ,
thought/think there was/is something wrong with me ,
based on my attraction 
or i should say ,
devotion for `` le locataire ''
they may be right ,
i do not know
but there is something irresistibly enthralling within polanski 's darkness and i have not even mentioned the humor .
the mystery
surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant ,
the mystery
that takes over him and 
naturally 
us 
me .
that building populated by great old academy award winner :
melvyn dougla 
shelley winter 
jo van fleet 
lila kedrova .
for anyone
who loves movie ,
this is compulsory viewing .
one 
two 
three 
many 
many viewing .
