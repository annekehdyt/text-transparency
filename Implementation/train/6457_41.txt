i have seen several commant here about brando
using a southern accent ,
some of which felt
it was a mistake .
when this movie was made ,
racism and discrimination were very strong in the south .
the jim crow law were still in effect .
civil right was in it is infancy .
could this have possibly been a subtle social commantary 
a southern man in love with a woman of another race ?
the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war ?
any thought ?
another commant was made about myoshi umeki
appearing `` cold '' .
anyone
who has been in japan
would understand .
the japanese person 
at least in my experience 
did not tend to show emotion in front of stranger .
there were strict social rule 
especially for man meeting single woman .
american in japan were totally foreign to this culture ,
and the blunt attempt
to meet woman
were shocking to the lady .
one trait of the japanese was to smile
when embarrassed or uncomfortable ,
which many american serviceman took as a sign
that their advance were welcomed .
also remember
that at the time represented in the movie 
japan had just been defeated ,
and the occupying force were treated with reluctant acceptance .
i think
myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been .
watching her interaction with the american actor ought back several memory of my own experience in the country .
i was able to meet a pair of lovely young lady
who ,
after i convinced them i was not the typical american male ,
taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country .
