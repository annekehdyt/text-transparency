this is a really nice and sweet movie
that the entire family can enjoy .
it is about two dog and a cat
who are taken away
to live with someone else for a little while
but the animal do not understand
and they escape and go to find the family on their own .
the cat is named sassy
and she lives up to her name .
chance is the younger dog
who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound .
shadow is the older and wiser dog
who senses thing .
put those three together on an adventure
and it makes for a happy
and fun filled time .
there are no special effect of the mouth moving
so it is not cheesy at all .
it is the best talking animal movie
that i have seen so far .
it is a really good movie for family .
