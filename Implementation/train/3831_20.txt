frankly i am rather incensed
that on the basis of the dazzling review attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hour on his debut offering .
have they all been written by his pal ?
the action clunk along 
the music is irritating and over used ,
the script is simply dire and the actor
( with the exception of the gardener ) mediocre at best .
i do think
we should support the effort of a young filmmaker
but saying
it is illiant
when it is not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistake again i.e .
continuing to write his own script
and using the same actor for another venture .
yes 
it is his first film 
low budget etc .
- i get it ,
but it is also out there for member of the public to purchase
and it is just not up to scratch .
