for a fan series 
i must admit
that hidden frontier is not at all that bad .
but 
reviewing this series can not be based
on whether it is a fan series or not .
the initiative in itself is commendable .
the creativity as well .
i reckon these are person with ordinary job 
and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek .
but 
doing all this work .
pulling all these resource .
taking all this time ,
and still all those flaws.first of all the acting ,
and the line are awful .
for most .
the dialogs belong in a 70 's military show 
not in star trek .
the captain
( mr squinty )
looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime .
and most character are just reading their line .
the director should be aware of the fact
that `` retake '' is not just a word in the dictionary .
but i also guess
that the series are made in the manner of `` two takes frake '' ,
who directed many of the tng episode and movie also ,
i could not help but think
that most of the actor are typical trekky .
without going any deeper into
that assumption.my biggest concern
regarding the whole project ,
is the quality of the release .
when they first decided to spend so much time ,
and resource on this series - why did not they make it available in decent quality ?
using the quick time format ,
with low low resolution is a waste of talent .
even the `` higre '' episode is considered bad quality
compared to the standard quality series
are released in .
using xvid codec ,
with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively .
if band with problem was the issue ,
setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that.let 's hope
the crew decides to ush the series up ,
and perhaps release it on dvd ,
giving it the quality the project deserves .
