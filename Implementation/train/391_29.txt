like all carnosaur movie 
this is a joke .
the way the dinosaur move 
reminds me of when my sister plays with her doll ,
because they can not be any stiffer or more fake-looking
than they were.the plot had no sense whatsoever .
i mean 
first they are on a bus ,
then in a warehouse then 
all of a sudden 
they are on a boat .
and let 's be serious ,
does it make sense
that a couple of dinosaur can stay together on a van 
or on a ship ?
i thought
dinosaur were the biggest animal ,
and now they can fit on a moving van .
it sounds stupid
even when you think about it.the only reason
for which i gave this a 3 ,
is because it is still entertaining .
i found it better than the first one
( have not watched the second yet ) .
just 
do not rent it .
i saw it on tv
and it is a good thing i did
because i would not have wanted to waste money renting it .
