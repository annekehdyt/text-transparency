the first 45 minute of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable .
the character are believable and interesting .
the cloning lab looks really high-tech .
after that 
it all collapse .
the character start behaving idiotically ,
and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor
( and this is supposedly `` present day '' )
going critical 
the only plot justification of which is that it is required
to kill the dragon -
only it does not .
the finish is incredibly weak .
one wonders what made a movie
that started out so well turn
so wrong.all the character
except dean cain are played by russian .
this result in some weird situation and detail 
like the character
being played by vessela dimitrova
being called `` bailey kent '' despite her heavy accent
( and despite her 
on one occasion 
inexplicably switching to *spanish* !
) .because of the decent start 
i considered rating this movie a 5 ,
but it really was more disappointing than that ,
so i only give it 4 .
