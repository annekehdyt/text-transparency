just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this :
the kid are one big gang
who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmaster and teacher .
`` rock 'n ' roll high school '' is taking place in that world .
it is like a ramone record coming to life .
the character are all as silly 
innocent and charming as the ramone ' song ,
and the music itself is 
of course 
fantastic .
high school comedy have really changed over the year ,
if you compare a movie like `` american pie '' with this late 70 's classic ,
where no tasteless sex joke are made at all .
since a remake is apparently in the work ,
it can probably be expected
that the charm of the original will get lost along the way
and will get replaced by vulgar 
half-funny dick joke ,
as bill hick used
to call them .
however 
the main problem will be that the ramone can not be replaced .
they were the perfect band
for this movie
and no one else could even come close to taking their place .
so 
the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone ,
as quirky and charming as it is .
gabba-gabba hey !
