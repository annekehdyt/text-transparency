the complaint are valid ,
to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for woman .
i am okay with these night time soap 
like grey 's anatomy 
or ugly betty 
or west wing ,
because there are story
that are interesting even with the given
that they will never end .
however 
when the idea parallels the daytime soap
aimed at just putting hunky man
( taye diggs 
tim daly 
and chris lowell )
into sexual tension and romp ,
and numerous ridiculous difficult situation in a so-called little hospital ,
it seems like general hospital ... or a female counterpart to baywatch .
that was what man wanted
and they had it ,
so if this is what woman want so be it ,
but the idea
that this is a high ow show
( or something man will watch )
is unrealistic .
