a beautiful and touching movie
that deserves a wider viewing
than it is likely to get .
semra turan plays aicha 
a second generation turkish immigrant ,
who tries to eak the mold .
neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family 
nor with her liberal danish friend 
aicha 's martial art experience becomes a fight
to find herself
and have the strength
to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friend.director natasha arthy manage to balance introspection and narrative so
that it has depth
without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse ,
and drawing on xian gao 's choreography skill pays off in spectacular fight sequence .
in the end 
however 
it is semra turan 's stunning debut performance
that gives this movie spirit .
raw charisma and requisite martial art skill are complimented by heart
to make her personal drama believable.well worth your while .
