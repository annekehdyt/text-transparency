not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'annie ' .
the character seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline
and they low quality feeling to the production .
it was very clearly made for tv ,
yet
if i found it on my television ,
i would flick it straight over .
the child in the film do an alright job ,
yet the adult acting is unbelievable
and so the movie fails to really draw you in .
this film lacked the music/dance number
that made the original illiant
and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love .
johnson 
as annie is at time annoying and over acted..you can not convince yourself
that she truly is annie .
the difference in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film .
sad to say
this sequel was a total flop .
