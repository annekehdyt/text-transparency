i saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s ,
yes it is gruesome ,
and could be the progenitor of the `` faces of death '' series popular in the 80s and 90s .
considering the state of so-called `` driver education '' these day ,
this one should be required
viewing for everyone
preparing to learn to drive .
when you see violent death in all its gore and horror ,
you certainly
( if you have any sensibility at all )
get a truer perspective on the responsibility
required to drive safely ,
what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do .
i worked for bell telephone in the 70s and 80s ,
and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class .
i found this film in the company liary ,
showed it at the session ,
a number of person got physically sick
and had to leave the room !
incredibly 
most of them later said
`` i never knew a car accident could be so terrible ! ''
this film 
and another 
`` red asphalt '' 
is certainly reality in its most graphic form .
i will never forget it ,
i only wish i could have found a copy
when my child were attending `` driver 's ed '' in high school !
