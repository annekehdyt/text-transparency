the title says
it all.i am
not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish person
commenting on this movie.obviously this movie
did not have a multi-million dollar budget ,
but the plot was very well done ,
the acting was awesome
and the cinematography was great !
it looked like you all had a lot of fun
making this movie !
i voted 9/10
as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both ,
but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd.i will definitely be checking out other movie
produced by brain damage film !
dylan o'leary 
cast and crew
