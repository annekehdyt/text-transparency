i have watched the first 17 episode
and this series is simply amazing !
i have not been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion .
this series is actually based off an h-game ,
which
i am not sure
if it is been done before or not ,
i have not played the game ,
but from what i have heard
it follows it very well.i give this series a 10/10 .
it has a great story 
interesting character ,
and some of the best animation i have seen .
it also has some great japanese music in it too !
if you have not seen this series yet ,
check it out .
you can find subbed episode on some anime websites out there ,
it is straight out of japan .
