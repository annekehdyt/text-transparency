i am going to write about this movie and about `` irreversible ''
( the ( in )
famous scene in it ) .
so you are warned ,
if you have not seen the movie yet .
this are just my thought ,
why i think
the movie fails
( in the end - pun intended )
.acting wise 
rosario dawson is really good
and almost convey portraying someone almost a decade younger
( a teenager in other word ) .
the villain guy is good ,
but loses his `` evil '' touch right before the end .
if he really never change ,
then why would he let a woman tie him up ?
he would not 
period .
then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude .
actually i do not think
you would need him .
at least not for the 2nd rape 
but more about that later on.let 's reprise the story .
rosario character is sexually insecure ,
might even have lesbian tendency
( see her scene with a female friend ) .
this was not intentional ,
as rosario state herself ,
but there is sexual tension between them .
rosario 's character meets a guy ,
who is a sexual predator ,
in all the bad sense .
but he makes an impression on her.rosario commented
that her character had a boyfriend before .
i beg to differ .
because she acts ,
as if it is her first boyfriend ,
which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother .
talking about her mother ,
here is another problem .
after the first rape takes place 
rosario character does not tell anyone what happened .
seiing
that her relationship with her mother is a very close one ,
nothing of that gets explored after that .
if rosario character would not call her mother anymore or would behave strangely ,
the mother would be worried like crazy .
there was so much potential here .
also her female friend :
we see her at the party ,
it is obvious there is something going on and `` boom ''
she is gone.the first rape
is almost unbearable to watch .
but feel like a pinch ,
when you compare it to the ending
( rape ) ,
which feel
like you are getting hit with a sledge hammer !
after rape no .
1 we get too stretched out scene .
thread are opened
( such as her construction work is an indication
that she might be lesbian ,
as one guy state
who tried to hit on her ... ) ,
but left in the open .
no real social contact is established ,
if you leave the bartender guy out ,
who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene .
it is apparent
that he is not a `` nice '' guy and his character get 's fleshed out a bit .
but when rosario character meets her rapist in class again ,
his being in the movie seems pointless .
we get the point
that rosario character is not the same anymore ,
that she went `` bad ''
and is able to hurt person .
( too )
many scene show exactly that ,
her being without emotion just doing drug and other stuff .
back to rapist # 1
who cheats on a test ,
gets caught by rosario character
and they decide to hang out together again
( really ? ) .
as absurd as that sounds 
the guy meets up with her ,
not without us having seen him beforehand 
with another girl
( very likely
that he raped her too ,
although we never see anything of that 
fortunately ) and his football career .
well career is a stretch
and he is bullied .
this is an attempt
to give his character some depth
and it almost works ,
but then again is too clich\u00e9 to stay with you .
so rapist # 1 submit to rosario character ...
why exactly ?
because he promised her ,
it was her day ?
again 
really ?
a guy like that never loses control 
especially with a woman
he raped
before ... i guess
this is supposed to show us
how stupid he is .
the bartender guy would have worked as someone
who could have hit him over the head or something ,
but letting him submit like that ,
just feel wrong .
another possibility would have a drug in his drink.so rapist # 1 undress
and get 's blindfolded
and let 's rosario character tie him on a bed ... .
seriously ,
that is just crazy !
but what comes next 
is even crazier .
first she talk to him ,
then she `` shut '' him up
and force an object into him .
this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one .
this is not about what this guy deserves or not ,
it is just intense .
and of course
that was what
they were aiming for .
now after she is `` done '' the bartender guy comes in and rape ... rapist # 1.
if this really should work as a revenge movie ,
it would have been better
if rosario character herself would have been doing all the `` revenge '' .
having a henchman doing the job ,
takes away everything
that was built up.this
is not supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable ,
it is a hard watch
and it is art-house .
but the 10 minute
( i did not count )
rape scene at the end ,
just smash everything .
rosario character is more or less ,
only watching what happens .
which ings me to the biggest disappointment.irreversible comparison :
`` irreversible '' had the rape scene ,
but the movie went on
( even if it was back into time ) .
rosario is looking into the camera in the end
and says
something about having to get over this .
first ,
that comes a bit too late ,
that should see her say
that after the initial rape .
and secondly and most importantly 
this is where the art-house movie should have come in .
it is more interesting seeing
were rosario character would go after the second rape scene
and how she would cope ,
with what she had done .
but then again 
she did not actually physically do that much
( see above ) ... a oken character
that the movie cuts off ... good intention
( talia and rosario had worked before ) ,
but failing to convey most of the thing ,
they set out to do
( even if you can see what they meant ,
it has to be convincing ,
otherwise it does not work ) ...
not to mention the overlong rape scene
as they are ...
