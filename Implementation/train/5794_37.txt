i rented this movie from the liary
( it is hard to find for good reason )
purely out of curiosity .
i am a huge plath fan
and this movie was a complete disappointment .
the bell jar
( 1979 )
is by far one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
the script is horrible ,
not because it strays from the original novel text ,
but because it strays
without focus or intent .
the scene are ill-constructed
and do not lead the viewer anywhere .
what is with the hokey voice over of plath 's poetry ?
lady lazarus has little do with greenwood 's situation ;
plath 's poetry was completely misused .
marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood
( or any 20 year old for that matter )
partly due to casting
( she was 32 during filming ,
the age plath was
when she died )
and partly due to the fact
that she can not act .
hassett is all emotion 
no craft 
no skill .
the direction is mediocre ;
the director simply covers what is there ,
which is not much .
the only reason i am
giving the film a 1
is because 0 is not an option .
sorry sylvia 
you will have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .
