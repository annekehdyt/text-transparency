the movie is a fantasy .
the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon
which some wonderful song are sung and sung beautifully .
( i still can not believe
that such handsome and attractive person could sing this well . )
some of the dialog is wonderfully clever .
the costume made me feel
as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942.movie are designed
to serve various purpose .
this one is designed to entertain
and it certainly does .
if i have one negative comment
it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old
to be the handsome dashing count .
some of the closeup made me uncomfortable .
but he could still sing and sing magnificently .
however 
jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever .
she makes a spectacular angel.this genre is well before my time 
and i an new to the jeanette macdonald/nelson eddy film and related conversation .
the music in this movie is beautiful .
as much as i love the classic rock music
which fills most modern movie ,
there is no question in my mind
that this music is simply and clearly more memorable 
more delightful 
better constructed .
the star in this movie are more talented than the star i see in the movie theater today .
and jeanette macdonald ,
without the benefit of beverly hill plastic surgeon ,
was more beautiful than the star i see today .
i am unclear
as to why so many other poster are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movie .
they say
it is dated
and try to explain
why it is the way it is .
and those
that do not like it
say
that it is not very good but
compared to what ?
i think
this movie will doubtless still be entertaining person
when so many other movie are long forgotten .
there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed .
i recommend this movie
without reservation to anyone
who appreciates great talent 
great beauty and great music .
