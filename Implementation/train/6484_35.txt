the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest ;
the intriguing plot
( such as it is )
seems initially to be too flimsy
to sustain even its trim 84 minute
but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled
as it goes along !
a would-be female vampire
( scan notily-clad ,
as promised by the title )
is held in captivity
inside a remote ch\u00e2teau
and emerges only to 'feast ' on the blood of willing victim
( who are apparently member of a suicide club )
as if unsure
where all of this would lead him ,
the writer-director ultimately has the human villain \u0096
actually the blank-faced hero 's kinky father \u0096 ludicrously revealed as a mutant
( ? ! )
from the future !
the languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere
( the cultist wear hood and animal mask to hide their feature from the sheltered girl )
are 
of course 
typical of both the film-maker
( ditto the seashore
setting at the { anti } climax )
and the `` euro-cult '' style ,
as are the bevy of nubile beauty on display .
personally 
the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive
but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson
( who appeared in six latter-day luis bunuel film )
crop up bemusedly
through it from time to time !
