la .
only susan survives.main suspect :
john holme

( paris hilton ) ) ,
comes into light as a suspect planner of the wonderland massacre.but what did happen that night ?
and could sharon
( lisa kudrow ) ,
john 's wife 
know something about it ?
'wonderland ' is a taught 
intense thriller 
a desperate love story and a story of a man 's sad decline all in one ;
there is a clever use of the 'rashomon ' technique
( we see the event of that fateful day and night from the eye of david 
john 
dawn 
susan
( albeit very iefly )
and sharon ) ,
a nice direction and a great script ,
but is mostly compelling for the performance 
especially kilmer 's ,
who takes central stage with his hopeless 
tormented 
sometimes childish holme 
lucas ' ,
whose launius is strangely alluring 
kudrow 's strong sharon and bosworth 's innocent dawn.wonderland :
9/10 .
