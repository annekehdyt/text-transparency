wow 
i love and respect pretty much anything
that david lynch has done .
however 
this movie is akin to a first filmmaker 's attempt
at making a pseudo art video .
to give you a couple of example :
1. david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker 
however ,
this had little visual artistic content
( blank wall ,
`` up shot '' with ceiling in the background )
2. david lynch typically takes great pride in audio 
however ,
in this you could even hear the video camera 's hum .
in fact 
it is very hard to swallow the idea
that he had anything to do with this movie .
unless ... ... this is a joke 
on david 's part 
to force fan search his website
( for hour )
only to find this drivel .
i hope so ,
because at least that idea is funny .
