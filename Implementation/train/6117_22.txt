this film is quite simply one of the worst film ever made
and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hack at work today .
not only did the film get mainstream distribution
it also features a good cast of british actor ,
so what went wrong ?
i do not know
and simply i do not care enough
to engage with the debate
because the film was so terrible
it deserves no thought at all .
be warned
and stay the hell away from this rubbish .
but apparently i need to write ten line of text in this review
so i might as well detail the plot .
a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father 's company
and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accent and stupid 
very stupid plot twists/device .
i should have asked for my money back
but was perhaps still in shock from the experience .
if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspect or the godfather ,
what about lock 
stock ... . thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film ... ..
