i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.the only thing
that saved this movie from me rating
it as a 1/10 was lacy chabert 's performance
who i thought
played the multiple personality really well .
for me
she was definitely the highlight of this movie.dina meyer
was pretty as always
but i found her role pretty bland
so i do not think
one can say
that her acting was great.as for the male lead 
armand assante 
his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctor in cheese 1980s hospital series.all of that i could have lived with .
however the terrible 
terrible 
terrible end/solution 
the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing
i have seen in a long time .
