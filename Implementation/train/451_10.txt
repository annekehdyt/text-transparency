i think
this show is definitely the greatest show .
jessica alba does such a great job in it .
michael weatherly also does an awesome job 
as well as the rest of the cast .
the show is very intriguing
and they have wonderful storyline
and their stunt are amazing .
it is like watching a 1-hour movie .
it is definitely worth watching .
