being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai
( devil man 
devil lady 
violence jack 
etc .
) 
i was looking forward to this one .
i would seen neither the manga nor the anime ,
so i had no preconceived notion going in .
good thing 
too .
what we have here is a series of silly softcore movie of the type
that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channel late at night .
while it is tame compared to what gets rammed down the throat of regular cable viewer
( our hero 's naughty bit are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect ) ,
there are prolonged scene of bondage and torture
that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess
to make it unsuitable for the kiddy .
while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female hero ,
i do dislike amateurishly made movie
( there are at least four in this series ) .
on the plus side 
there is at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episode i saw .
it is no wonder
nagai 's testicle boy never made it ...
