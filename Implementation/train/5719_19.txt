this film is terrible .
the character are completely unbelievable 
and wildly inconsistent .
the plot is awful
and some of the classroom scene are cringe-worthy
and make for uncomfortable viewing.in
fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest
that this film was written by high school student 
only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest
that 
in fact 
the writer probably never went to high school .
the acting in most case was weak too ,
although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot ,
i am not sure
that any actor could have made this film watchable.having said
that the sound track was ok ,
and the cinematography was nice in place
( although the editing was poor ) .
