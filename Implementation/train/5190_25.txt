what can you say
when you see a good french movie
which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the character ?
the major point is we believe in those character
and once they have met each other
we want them to stay together .
it is simple and really efficient .
the background story is less important .
why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller ?
it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstration most french film-jerker like to make .
not too much ambition 
right :
sur me l\u00e8vres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization.for
all the clever noir point in the screenplay the end is by far too easy .
it goes quite as easy as in rear window
( an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film )
but with a less compelling context .
where i am amazed
it is to see
that the character of the probation officer has not been erased .
he ings very little to the story ;
when he appears alone we wonder
if we have not missed a part before .
jacque audiard is not a new-comer yet .
strange and weird .
