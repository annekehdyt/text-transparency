love rosario dawson 
think
she is one of the finest actress of the modern era.descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else .
it is the consistent undertone in everything in the film .
the dialog is flat 
the character seemingly intentionally bland and one sided .
the only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the character and rosario 's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.pitching this
as a rape classic is not appropriate ,
and that is probably why so many person do not enjoy the film .
the standard 'rape ' audience would not particularly like this film ,
and maybe that is the point ?
the film asks more question than it answers ,
and it does confront it is target audience ,
whether they like it or not .
there is a compelling relationship between the character and the target audience
and while the film does not slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity
it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be ,
all the wrong reasons.descent is a good film
which imho is severely under-rated .
