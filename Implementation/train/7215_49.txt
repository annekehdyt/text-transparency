shazbot 
is this embarrassing .
in fact 
here is a list of 100
that makes up the embarrassment :
1 . )
a failed comeback for christopher lloyd .
2 . )
jeff daniel basically playing the same role
he played in the live 101 dalmatian remake
which was not too juicy to begin with .
he sure has a funny way
of promoting his purple rose theatre ...
3 . )
disnefluff .
4 . )
another disappointing reminder
that wallace shawn is to disney what jet li
was to bob hoskin in unleashed .
5 . )
ray walston 
the original martian from the tv series 
played a bit part
( read `` cameo '' )
in this flick
and died two year later of lupus .
coincidence ?
6 . )
awful special effect .
seriously - awful .
7.-100 . )
that damn talking ,
farting suit voiced to an annoying degree by wayne knight
( `` newman ! `` ) .
my favorite scene ?
ha !
ha ha 
ha !
ha ha ha ha ha ...
whew ! ...
good one .
you - you are a joker .
okay 
let 's wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this franchise 's agonizing death ,
and
if you would like ,
you can say a quick prayer
that disney does not forget this travesty
and do something silly like a movie adaptation of `` mork and mindy '' starring tim allen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
