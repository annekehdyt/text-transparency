there is no such a thing as perfect murder.lieutenant columbo knows that.ken franklin ,
who is the other half of the writing team of detective story does not know that.he kills his partner jim ferris
who had plan on going solo.now columbo step into the picture
and asks all sort of question from mr. franklin.and return for one more question.columbo :
murder by the book
( 1971 )
is directed by the young steven spielberg
before his day of fame.steven bochco wrote it.columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look.it is hard to believe
this man could solve any crime.but he could.each and every one of them !
peter falk is the one and only person in the world
that could portray this character.so no remake ,
please.this part is a very good example of how columbo worked.jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim.rosemary forsyth plays
the victim 's wife joanna ferris.there is something endearing in the scene between columbo and her.how
he makes the omelet and everything.barbara colby plays lilly la sanka.she actually met a tragic fate
when she died
after a homicide like she does
here.i have been a fan of columbo since childhood
and i still enjoy
watching them.there was a eak for many year
that they were not showing columbo story at all
but now he is back.back for one more question .
