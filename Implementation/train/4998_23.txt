i have to say
that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird way
to solve a mystery .
a little too simple 
nancy drew
( emma robert )
uses imdb ...
that is fantastic !
i really liked about that part of the movie ... corky
( josh flitter )
is however extremely hilarious ... and ned nickerson
( max thieriot )
seemed really hopeless ...
he should have been more angry with her
for how she has treated him ... alright ,
this movie is tour and fashion in disguise .
anyhow 
i recommend this movie 
just for summer fun .
encore nancy 
just for fun .
more teen spy movie by emma robert.. spymate ... remember ?
she is becoming good at this tricky detective work .
