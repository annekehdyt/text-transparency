there is one good thing in this movie :
lola glaudini 's ass !
sorry to be so blunt
but it is the truth .
too bad
she did
not do a nude .
it would at least have made this mess tolerable .
we see another chick 's boobs
but she is nowhere near lola .
and man 
is armand assante old or what ?
the man looks like crap !
`` consequence '' is the usual b-movie
you would expect .
the story had potential .
it is like they had good idea
but did not know how to execute them .
the cinematography is just plain awful .
ugly !
the directing is uninspired
and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twist and washed up actor .
lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap 
slutty way
but not even she saves `` consequence '' from being trash and not funny trash 
just plain old stinking trash .
