i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 !
the final episode of the 10th season `` unending '' ,
where
( it would certainly appear that )
the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed 
unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion ,
left me in disbelief !
from the extremely rushed end of the series ,
it is obvious
that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season .
my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these story
to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd move !
unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie
( with a very good explanation of the `` apparent '' extinction ) ,
i think
that the fan have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-end ! poor end to an otherwise illiant sci-fi series .
