'major payne ' is a film about a major
who makes life a living hell for his small group of boy in the marine .
this film does not really have a lot to offer ,
but it provides several hilarious moment
that are well-worth a watch .
do not expect it to be a memorable film 
however .
just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other person .
the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious ,
and that is really all i remember about the film except for the boy wanting revenge on major payne .
again 
it is not a great film ,
and it is probably best watched on a rainy day
when you need some laughter .
