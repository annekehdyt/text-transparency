`` footlight parade '' is fascinating on so many level .
there is no way the supposedly staged `` theater prologue '' could have been produced in any theater on earth 
of course .
think of the huge pool and three-story tall fountain for `` by a waterfall 
'' for instance .
( berkeley directed john garfield in `` they made me a criminal '' six year later
and had the dead end kid
singing `` by a waterfall ''
as they took their shower . )
`` shanghai lil '' is the best production number in the picture .
it is a catalog of '30s warner bros. sensibility .
note
the african guy mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitute .
you would never see black integrated into a social scene in other film of the period
unless
they were porter on a train or maid in a big house .
here the black guy are sitting at the bar
and singing with the other .
i also get a thrill
when the military dancer do a `` card section '' presentation of roosevelt 's image .
there is also the nra eagle
-- the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal .
fdr was the new president
and hope were so high
that he had pull the nation out of the depression .
you would never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm 
of course .
warner bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f.d.r .
administration .
dear little miss ruby keeler was never better
than she is playing the chinese hooker 
`` lil . ''
she hardly even watches her foot
as she dances ,
which was one of her signature flaws .
the pre-code stuff is fun .
the `` by a waterfall '' number is wonderful in that regard .
the girl change into their bathing suit on the crowded bus speeding through time square with all its light on .
the spread-eagle girl swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shot
that would not be seen for 35 year .
in a few month the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasure .
