the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe
any of these person would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth .
hearing david lansbury 's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous `` tomorrow 
tomorrow 
and tomorrow '' speech made it impossible to believe
anyone would ever consider him for the role .
i kept believing therefore
that he did not get the part because
he was a lousy actor ;
not because a bigger name was available .
then when we see portion of the play in rehearsal
it is difficult to believe
the director is not parodying thing with a hopelessly miscast 
misdirected travesty of actor
who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and director
who see the play through their own screwball interpretation .
sometimes director are so anxious to have their film done
( and writer think
they have the ability
to direct their own work )
that they settle for less .
this appears to be such an example .
