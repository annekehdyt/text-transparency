as a writer i find film this bad
making it into production a complete slap in the face .
talk about insulting .
i was writing better story than this in 8th grade .
bad acting ,
bad writing ,
bad
directing and when added all together
the result is complete and total failure .
the only thing this movie manages
to accomplish
is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time .
who would green light something so poorly written ?
it is not artistic 
clever 
smart 
suspenseful 
mysterious 
scary 
dramatic-nothing.the character are flat and boring with no developmant .
the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can .
they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actor
who all must be pretty desperate for work
or hoping one of these low budget independent movie will turn out to be the next `` pulp fiction '' .
this script should have been used to line a bird cage 
not a movie .
oh and last but not least 
a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength
to kill man
and woman twice her size
without a struggle and in a single blow .
avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std .
