this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen .
i watched it with a large group of friend
and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot .
aside from the lack of plot ,
the acting was atrocious ,
the `` special effect '' were not so special ,
and the writing was absolutely horrible .
the movie 's only redeeming factor is that it is so incredibly bad
that it is quite funny .
you can not help but laugh at a zombie
being run
over while actor are spewing crappy dialogue .
i would not recommend this film to anyone
looking for a good movie ,
but it is something
that a group of friend can get together
and have a good laugh about .
it is now a running joke among my friend and i .
1/10 .
