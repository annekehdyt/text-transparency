ivan reitman is something of a savior .
the most tired plot
( ghostbuster 
evolution )
come to life in his skilled hand .
even his occasional flop
( six day 
seven night )
show sign of life and humor
that make it worth viewing .
so i was disappointed
that reitman could not take a fairly original plot
( man dumps superhero 
superhero gets superpower-fueled revenge ) ,
and shape it into something enjoyable .
`` girlfriend '' is an exercise in pointlessness .
the one-trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minute .
the film can not decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama .
the result is a film the flip-flop between both ,
with neither aspect being very well done .
uma thurman is tops 
as usual 
and luke wilson pull off his role too ,
though his slacker antic quickly grow tired .
what is even more maddening is that 
in certain scene
( such as when a very turned on uma knock a headboard through a wall ) ,
you sense a witty ,
raucous reitman opus practically screaming to get out .
but second later 
the magic is lost ,
gone as quick as the superheroine whose movie disappoint in almost every way .
