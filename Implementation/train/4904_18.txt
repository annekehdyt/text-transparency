caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance
and without knowing
what i was in for .
many horror fan may have missed this thinking
it was a typical prison film and the one
who did get
it did not like it
as it was not what they wanted to see .
the above mentioned factor are probably the reason
it is low rated
but just ignore
that
and give it a whirl
if you are a fan of the genre.it
has strong suit in all department from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself .
an absolute diamond 
a film i still have on video to this day .
check it out .
