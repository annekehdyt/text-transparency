excellent political thriller 
played much quieter and slower than other 
higher ranking film in this genre .
when person talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performance ?
a story of friendship 
father-son relationship 
corruption and deceit .
the two actor gel amazingly well together ,
and the support from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive ,
although aiello is illiant ,
especially when the paper run to press .
instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal ,
it creates wonderful character
who show the human side of failure an political ibery ,
the final scene with each of the main character are wonderfully written and acted .
