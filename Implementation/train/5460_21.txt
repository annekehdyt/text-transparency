i have seen a lot of movie
and rarely would i ever rate a movie `` 1 ''
but this movie was beyond terrible.the acting was terrible ,
the plot was ridiculous ,
the effect were unrealistic
and the character were annoying .
usually when i watch scary movie i think
it is dumb
when the character hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out `` hello is anyone there ? ''
- but at least they are believable
when they do it.. this movie could not even get
that right.this is a movie
that 'll make other b-horror movie like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.i
always have an open mind
while watching movie and i can only say
that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment
so
that anyone else
who 's thinking of watching this movie
will think again .
it is awful !
