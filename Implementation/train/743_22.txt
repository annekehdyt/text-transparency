a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent
( a non-speaking part ,
as i recall ) .
he ought it over on dvd so i could see it .
it was `` interesting '' ,
but very much felt like an amateur film .
a well made amateur film 
though .
really boring and poorly written .
it was probably fun to make
and be involved in ,
but it definitely did not deserve any kind of wide release .
maybe in omaha they had enjoy it ,
but this california girl was bored
and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend 's involvement.if this film maker has made or makes any more film ,
he really should try to have a really interesting story line 
and good actor .
i am
sure this was a great learning tool for them .
i wish them luck in the future ,
and hope
they can improve their film making .
