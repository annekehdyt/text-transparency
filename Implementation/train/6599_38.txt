it is a good thing
the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance
because i would hate to think of him going out on free money .
not what his fan ought to remember him by.brando in his last year
is looking more like orson welle and free money is the kind of film welle
would have done looking for financing of his own work .
brando is the warden of a local prison
which in america ,
when it is located in a small rural
setting
is usually the largest employer in the area .
that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout .
unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges ,
his two twin bimbo otherwise known as daughter .
even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of loser 
charlie sheen and thomas haden church 
their heart still belong to daddy.not to fear
because brando 's willing to give them job in the prison
where they work under condition
not much better
than the convict have .
what to do ,
but commit a robbery of a train
which goes through the locality every
so often carrying used money
to be burned by the treasury .
although free money has some moment of humor ,
for most of the time it is quite beneath the talent of all those involved .
some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter 
but also straight arrow fbi agent.of course these person
and the rest of the cast got to work with someone
who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century .
were it not for brando 's presence
and were it some 40 year earlier ,
free money would be playing the drive-in circuit in red state america
where the populace could see
how they are being satirized.or a feeble attempt
is made to satirize them .
