ostensibly this is a z-grade dtv horror film.but with line like : ''
it is easy to die ,
i have 
many time '' and '' why are you reading that book ? ''
`` because it makes the plot more interesting '' and ''
you made your way in here ,
now you can make your way out again ! ''
( after he leads a man into the basement )
( and take a listen to what they chant )
- it is not that clear what this film ,
made in the era known for post-structuralism ,
is actually about 
or whether its just bad film-making .
the acting is atrocious ,
but some actor i know ,
so are they hamming it up ? an old house ,
cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling ,
is the site of murder .
a ( bad ) film is made in the ground and the story replays again .
