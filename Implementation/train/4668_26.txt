snl is pretty funny but person
who say
this is like
watching a short skit on snl
is a little dumb minded .
it is nothing like snl ,
it is just a stupid piece of crap.andy samberg try to act like jon heder but fail .
although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy try his hardest
and person think
he is funny.only funny person in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader .
the only part
that was decently funny with andy
was the pool part.they
could have made the `` quiet place '' a lot better
if they did not make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.the part
where he is pronouncing his h 's more is retarded .
they try going with it too long
and half the time
it looks
like andy is laughing
while he acts ...
he is a horrible actor
and does not deserve to be in a movie.this movie
is a joke
and is for the simple minded person with the ain of a 10 year old level of comedy .
which is about half the united state .
