i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival .
i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan
so i know a thing or two about film .
and crispin glover 's film is outrageous .
he basically exploits the mentally challenged .
not only is shirly temple the anti-christ
( which i admit is a little funny )
telling the mentally challenged to kill each other ,
but there is an obsession with killing snail .
crispin also plays with the idea
of being in love with one of his actor
who is as they all are 
mentally challenged .
peta and human right should be all over this thing .
it is not 'counter-culture ' as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival ,
it is exploitation .
