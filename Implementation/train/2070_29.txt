i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewer out of romania .
this tells something certainly about the value 
or maybe about the lack of universality of the film ,
but also tells something
about how different history and even life of common person was in romania
compared to other country ,
even in eastern europe.the film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda 
a controversial novelist
who died during the communist rule soon
after the book was published .
it tells the story of an intellectual ,
professor of philosophy whose life is crushed
after he is imprisoned on false accusation at the end of the stalinist era .
basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison ,
the second describes his tentative to regain his life
after being released .
his release is actually only apparent 
romania of the 60s ask from him different type of compromise and crime ,
but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally
as in prison.the film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actor .
stefan iordache
who has the lead role
would be in another time and another place a mega-star ,
we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art .
although suffering from a hesitant story-telling
and falling sometimes in non-essential detail or character comic ,
the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema 
as well as for the process
of recovering the moral and historic value in the romanian society .
