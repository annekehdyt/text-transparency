this movie is one of the most awful movie
ever made.how can jon bon jovi play in a movie ?
he is a singer not an actor ,
what ? is he killing vampire with his guitar ?
and what about the dreadful plot ?
o my god this movie really sucks .
in the end is the queen of vampire
played by the eternal vampire arly jover
( blade )
surrounded by an army of vampire ,
but when the `` fantastic '' slayer arrive
only 4 vampire are left ! !
what happened with the other 10-15 vampire ?
they run out in the sun ? ? ?
and what about the `` grand finally ''
when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun ? ? ?
that is really a `` not '' .
in `` buffy the vampire slayer '' in 100 episode not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun ? ? ?
this really is a lack of originality !
