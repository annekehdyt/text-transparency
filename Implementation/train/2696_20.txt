this must be one of the most overrated spanish film in history .
its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish 
with only good/bad character .
the world is just not like this ,
and good movie show complex character with opposite impulse 
dilemmas 
etc .
however ,
what i hate
most about this film
is bola 's friend 's father .
the director tries to teach us a good lesson :
tattoo artist with shaved head are not always bad guy ,
in fact they can be better than the average looking dad
( wow ,
this is like ... philosophy 
or something ) .
thank you 
achero .
i will propose you for the nobel prize of literature .
