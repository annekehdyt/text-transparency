utterly predictable silly show about a man
who has killed his wife by mowing her down
when driving and claimed
he had blacked out .
why was he still driving a car ?
why did
he
still feel able to drive a car
having killed his wife with one ?
this question has not occurred to the writer .
the story then witter on about a psychologist and her failing marriage
which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver .
an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure ,
and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale .
are police psychologist
so easily taken in ?
deadful writing
that the actor do their best with ,
but they are doomed to failure .
this is on a par with a harlequin romance .
do not waste your time
watching this one unless
that is what you are aiming for .
