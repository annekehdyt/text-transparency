this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film .
nothing new or original is added other than perry 's backflash ,
which are of marginal interest .
it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency
that made it so effective .
also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jone soundtrack
that added to much to the original film .
i can not understand any high rating for this at all .
it is quite bad .
why does anyone waste time or money
making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it ?
