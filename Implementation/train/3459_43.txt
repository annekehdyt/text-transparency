i already loved `` how the grinch stole christmas ''
when it was released
and i am
still loving it now 
5 year later .
still lot of person seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie
never really had received much love at the time
it came out.sure ,
the movie is over-the-top and campy
but that at the very same is also the reason
why this movie is so charming and fun to watch .
all of the set 
costume and character are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way ,
without ever becoming truly ridicule .
it is a visually spectacular movie to watch .
it is a campy movie
making at its very best !
director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie.main reason
why the movie work
and why it is so much fun to watch
is jim carrey as the grinch .
he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role .
he is of course helped by the convincing make-up ,
which also received an academy award .
of course if you are a jim carrey hater
you
should not even think about watching this movie .
this movie is really his movie
and he makes it all work
and so much fun to watch .
other fun and memorable role are being played by jeffrey tambor 
clint howard and josh ryan evans
as the young grinch.the movie has a good morale
but it is all a bit sappy to me .
perhaps it is because i am dutch
and we do not really celeate christmas that enthusiastic and big here 
as in the united state or england .
for me the movie was simply fun
and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.the musical
score by jame horner is good and fun ,
even though it is your average every day horner stuff ,
it still all work perfectly for the movie
and helps to make some of the scene 's work.perfect christmas entertainment.8/10
