first off 
anyone
who thinks this sequel to william friedkin 's `` the french connection '' ,
is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both .
the problem
with reviewing this film
is that 
a . )
it is a sequel to a illiant movie ,
which always makes watching it objectively difficult 
and b . )
it is directed by john frankenhimer 
one of the best american director ever ,
so i wanted to like it .
william friendkin was the perfect person
to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city ,
because of his documentary-like approach to the action and story ,
frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish director ever 
i.e .
`` the manchurian candidate '' and `` second '' 
and with his `` french connection 2 '' it feels like someone trying to be gritty
and not having the true understanding
to pull it off .
that fact
that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself
really tells a lot about hackman 's understanding about the original film too .
it is well known hackman hated friedkin on the set
and vowed to never work with him again ,
it is also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional 
loosing weight
and trying to play him like a straight character .
it shows you hackman ,
despite being a great actor ,
had no idea
who to make the movie and the story great .
the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting ,
but does not warrant the rest of the film .
an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer 's filmography .
