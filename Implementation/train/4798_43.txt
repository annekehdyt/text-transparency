i had a chance
to see a screening of this movie recently .
i believe
that it will be in theater in canada some time around mother 's day .
if it is in a theater near you ... go !
it is not a funny feel-good movie -
it is more along the line of a feel
and think
movie.the director does an excellent job of character development -
letting you into the heart 
mind and hurt of hagar little by little .
at first 
her attitude and behavior do not make much sense .
as her story unfold 
she becomes someone
you can understand .
as in life ... understanding ings empathy .
i found her likable by the end of the movie -
particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake.hagar 's relationship with her two son is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experience in this world .
her youngest son 
john ,
who is full of life
and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion
that is so authentic
and rare.it is fun to see ellen page acting in this movie .
she is so very different than the young woman
that she plays in juno .
it gives me an even oader appreciation for her acting ability .
if you loved her in juno ,
you will love her in the stone angel.of course ,
there is ellen burnstyn as hagar .
there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor
to make you forget every other character
they have ever played .
never once in the course of this movie did i ever
think
of ellen burnstyn - i always and only thought of hagar .
she swept me into her character - hook 
line and sinker.kari skogland 's capacity
to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada 's most cherished author
is impressive .
she illiantly ings to the screen both the stoney and angelic part of this complex woman ,
hagar - the stone angel .
