hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental
or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no
thought required .
there are the requisite explosion and hammy acting and pretty lady .
a pretty good cast with donald sutherland 
john lithgow 
and the lovely tia carrere .
this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one..on a scale of one to ten ..a 4
