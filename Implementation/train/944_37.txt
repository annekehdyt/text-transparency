gday mates !
just watched croc hunter the movie .
it was alright
but the show seems more real .
this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier line and more character .
a few thing :
steve described snakes fang like hypodermic needle .
yeeeowch !
for real you know
that hurts .
and can not they jump up high ?
hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff .
there was two major cleavage shot in this movie .
when terry find
that baby joey she goes like `` we
have to nurture them ,
just like a baby '' .
woah !
i thought
she was gon na up and east feed that kid .
that woulda made it pg-13 though .
while on terry ,
did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry 's knowledge on ritual mating .
she knows her sex stuff .
movie takes place in queensland 
austrailia .
i want a koala 
dingo ,
and joey ! steve 's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie .
albeit a small one
which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.oh
and if anyone else watches this ,
try and agree with me
in saying
that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dog was right in shotgunning the croc .
he was eating her sheep ! !
i would be mad too !
