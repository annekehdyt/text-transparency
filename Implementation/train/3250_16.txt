silly 
hilarious 
tragic 
sad 
inevitable.a group of down-and-out team up with a `` seasoned '' crook
to elevate themselves out of their poverty .
great idea ...
if you ignore the screwup factor.nice to see george clooney
doing something genuinely funny for a change .
the casting is perfect and the acting standard very high .
although it could be said
that the motley crew subject is not new ,
i think
this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way .
sufficiently so
that it stands out from what has gone before.very well done guy .
