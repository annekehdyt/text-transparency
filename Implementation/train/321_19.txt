i have not yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from ,
but i am familiar with some of his other work
and was interested to see
how it would be translated to the screen .
overall 
i think
this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut 's novel .
it concerns the story of an american living in germany
who is recruited as a spy for the us .
his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi 's and send secret message to the american 's via his weekly radio show .
but when the war ends
he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york ,
where various odd plot twist await.if mother night has a problem
it is that it tends to get a little too sentimental at time .
but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum
and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb .
and there are some fabulous moment of black comedy
involving three right wing christian fundamentalist and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell .
very much recommended .
