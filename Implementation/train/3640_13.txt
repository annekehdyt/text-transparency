the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempt as 9 and a half week ...
the courtroom scene itself ... with the couple copulating in the cage
while the heroine plead for their orgasm ... is amazing ... i have not seen this movie in 20 year ...
but it made indelible picture in my mind ...
it is rich in texture and successful
in creating a world
where sex is the engine for all activity ,
and at its bottom is the yawning angst
that lives in us all ... .the plot is european ,
and it meanders a bit ,
but so does life ...
especially when you are 17
and have a constant hard on ... .
