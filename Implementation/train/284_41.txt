on the face of it a film about woman wanting
to see a football match
would not appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself
however this is not about football
it is about discrimination and the woman 's enthusiasm for the sport they love.the film open on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain 
a girl is trying to get in to tehran 's azadi stadium by dressing like a boy ,
it looks like
she will get in until a soldier try to search her .
once caught
she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium
where there are a handful of woman
who had already been caught ,
here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldier
who 's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock .
we never learn the character 's name
but we get to know them as person as the girl plead with the guard
to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall
and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commantary.as well
as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran
the film contains many hilarious momant such as the `` disguise '' one of the girl is made to wear
when going to the toilet and the girl
who disguised herself as a soldier
and was only caught
because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer .
the girl enthusiasm for the game is such
that by the end
the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping
that iran will win
and thus get to go to the final in germany .
the soldier are not shown as fundamantalist ,
they are just conscript who are there
because they have to be
and when explaining to the girl why woman can not watch man 's sport do not seem that
convinced by their own argumants.it is a shame
that this film can not be seen in iran itself
but it is good
that the wider world can see it
and thus see
that ordinary iranian are not a bunch of fanatic desperate to wage war on the west but normal person with the same passion and concern as person everywhere .
the cast did a great job
in making their character seem like real person rather than mere caricature .
