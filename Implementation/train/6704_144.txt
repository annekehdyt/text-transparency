i have never seen a show as good as full house .
full house puts all of the newer shows to shame 
big time !
anyone
who has never seen it ,
which i do not see how it is possible ,
should see it .
it is a great show for anyone of any age .
full house will make you laugh ,
it will make you cry ,
it will amaze you .
true 
some person feel
that there are some `` cheesy '' aspect to the show 
but 
the positive aspect out weigh all of the `` cheesy '' aspect .
full house ran
it is first episode on september 22 ,
1987 entitled `` our very first show ''
and ran it is last episode on may 23 ,
1995 entitled `` michelle ride again part ii '' .the plot of the show is very believable .
danny tanner
( bob saget )
loss his wife 
pam 
in an accident
involving a drunk driver .
danny has his other in law 
jesse katsopolis
( john stamos ) ,
which is pam 's younger other ,
and danny also ings in his best friend joey gladstone

( jodie sweetin ) ,
and michelle
( mary-kate and ashley olsen )
.joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girl for a few month just to help out
and end up living with them for eight year ;
which is the number of year
the show ran for.the
following is a short description of some of the character and the actor/actress
who played him/her :
john stamos
( jesse ) :
john stamos is a great actor .
he plays jesse .
jesse is a rock star waiting
to get his big eak .
in full house 
john stamos does a great job portraying his character .
he looked
and played music like his idol 
elvis presley.bob saget
( danny ) :
bob saget is also a great actor .
he looses his wife in car accident
involving a drunk driver .
he has to raise three girl
without a having the girl 's mother .
bob saget does a great job portraying a single parent
who works full time
and still has time
to raise his three girl.dave coulier
( joey ) :
one word can describe dave coulier 
funny .
he is great .
playing the character of joey was perfect for him .
he does a great job
playing the stand-up comedian
waiting for his big eak.candice cameron-bure
( dj ) :
she is a tremendous actress .
she plays the oldest sister 
dj
which is short for donna jo .
she is one of the best
actress i have ever seen .
her acting ability in full house was very believable.jodie sweetin
( stephanie ) :
two simple word can describe jodie sweetin 
incredibly amazing !
i wish i could say
every thing
that i would like to say about jodie 
but ,
i would use up the 1,000 word maximum just on her .
she got her start in a kid show
called mother goose story
and when she came to full house ,
she blew the audience 's and creator 's mind .
her great look and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success
that it was .
according to dave coulier ,
jodie was supposed to be the star of the show .
it was supposed to be where
she was going to get her big eak .
jodie 
at five year old
when the show first aired ,
could hit every line perfectly .
she showed great enthusiasm .
most young kid can not do this .
as you can probably guess ,
jodie sweetin
( stephanie )
is my favorite character in full house.mary-kate and ashley olsen
( michelle ) :
great actress .
full house is where they got their start .
they received the part of michelle
because they were the only baby
who did not cry
while in front of a camera.there
are many more cast member
that should be recognized .
these are the original character
from when the show first went on the air in 1987.the only negative thing
that i can say
is how full house became the michelle show towards the end .
i think
it was to focused on her towards the end .
especially when i think
jodie and candice were much better at acting.full house is a great show for everyone .
it can teach you a lot .
one of the biggest thing
it can teach
you
is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy 
such as loosing a family member 
occurs .
full house continues to attract new fan .
with all this said ,
there is only a couple thing left to say ;
full house will never die 
and 
thank you 
the cast of full house ,
for giving everyone a show
that they can enjoy .
