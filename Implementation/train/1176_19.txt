the social commentary was way overblown
and the mystery itself is built
and solved through a series of implausible coincidence
that were entirely unbelievable .
nothing has changed in fitz 's personal life in the past decade
that makes it remotely interesting .
i even had trouble understanding
why he was complaining about his stay in australia
as compared to the opportunity
to solve mystery
that he has in england .
can he not insinuate himself on the australian police ?
it seems like a very artificial plot point
to get him involved in a crime investigation.the
latter episode of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible ,
sometimes bordering on silliness ,
and this one picks up
that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one .
sad .
