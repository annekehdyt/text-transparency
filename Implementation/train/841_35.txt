and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself .
no matter how it evolved
( at point being a movie about disco ) ,
it ended up as one of the ultimate movie
in which kid want to rock out ,
but the principal stand in their way .
think back to those rock'n'roll movie of the 50 's
in which the day is saved
when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry
to prove
that rock and roll music is really cool and safe for the kid ,
and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance .
forward to the 1979 
repeat the same plot ,
but throw in da ramone ,
whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential band of the next quarter century
( and then for the obligatory dj guest shot 
`` the real '' don steele ) .
throw in 
too 
all the element of a roger corman-produced comedy-exploitation film 
except for the two-day shooting schedule 
some of the familiar corman repertory player like clint howard 
mary wournow and dick miller
( there since `` bucket of blood '' ) ,
and you have got one of the great stoopid movie of the day .
one of the few film
that uses deliberate cheesiness
and gets away with it .
i showed the new dvd to a friend
who could only remember seeing part of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in ,
and he agreed
that this is one of the great movie
to be watching drunk 
not the least for the lovely leading lady and the great ramone footage .
