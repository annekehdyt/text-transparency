amateur 
no budget film can be surprisingly good ...
this however is not one of them.ah 
another brad sykes atrocity .
the acting is hideous 
except for emmy smith
who shows some promise .
the camera `` direction '' needs serious reworking .
and no more `` hold the camera and run '' gimmick either ;
it just does not work .
the special effect are unimaginative ,
there is a problem
when the effect can be identified in real time .
if you are going to rip off an ear ,
please do not let us see the actor 's real ear beneath the blood .
the scenery is bland and boring
( same as mr. sykes other venture ) ,
and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn
and really bad guitar driven metal
( see the scenery comment )
.did i mention the lack of any real plot 
or character development ?
apparently 
the scriptwriter did not.whoever is funding this guy ...
please stop .
i have seen some of his other `` home movie ''
( which i will not plug )
and they are just as bad .
normally 
a `` director '' will grow
and learn from his previous effort ... not this guy .
it is one thing to be an amateur filmmaker ,
but anyone can be a hack.definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course ,
chewing on popcorn kernel would be less painful than this effort.award :
the worst ever military push-up in a film .
