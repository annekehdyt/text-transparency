this third darkman was definitely better than the second one ,
but still far worse than the original movie .
what made this one better than d2 was the fact
that the bad guy had been changed
and durant was not ought back again .
furthermore there was actually some hint of character development
when it came to the bad guy 's family and darkman himself .
this made my heart soften
and i gave this flick as much as 4/10 
i.e .
**/***** .
