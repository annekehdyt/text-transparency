what was this supposed to be ?
a remake of fisher king ?
why do we care about sandler 's character ?
what a slow 
dreary 
boring 
who-gives-a-damn-about-these-people movie ! ! !
just simply painful to sit through ,
i turned it off
before it was over .
it is so obvious
that cheadle needs help as much as sandler ;
like i said :
can you say `` fisher king '' ?
and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life ?
we are not supposed to think that deeply 
i guess .
why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him ?
if they were such good friend ,
how did they grow apart ?
if cheadle is so in control ,
why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street ?
we are never told .
that is why
fisher king was a better film on so many level
and why this just suck .
nearly 8/10 average score ?
i do not agree .
at all .
even the top film are lucky to get such a high average rating ,
and this crap does not deserve to be in the same universe with them .
