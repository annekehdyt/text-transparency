sean 
you know i think
that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world ,
but i can not commend you for this .
comedy just is not your strong suit.however ,
it was not all your fault .
some of the stuff was just too hard to understand .
alfred lynch did a decent job ,
but you got ta wonder
where the line came from from the beginning.once again 
sean ... i apologize .
