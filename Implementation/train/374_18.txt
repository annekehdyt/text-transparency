the symbolic use of object 
form editing 
the position of character in the scene ... these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock
that you can really see what a fertile genius he had .
the way the wife move from one corner of the ring to the other
as the fight progresses 
the editing
when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ...
while these may seem a bit obvious by today standard ,
in the silent era they spoke volume about the story
without a word
being spoken .
even the title has a least four meaning
that i can see ;
the boxing ring 
the wedding ring 
the acelet the lover buys 
and the love triangle at the heart of the story .
