i just do not get some of the big premise of this episode -
that miranda is so remarkable ,
and that there is anything so ugly
it would make you insane .
someone here made the remark
that maybe it is the frequency of the light wave or something
rather than it being ugliness .
miranda is just a jerk .
the episode is slow 
inconsistent and way too talky .
i also do not quite understand
why kolos is an ambassador -
why does not the federation just leave the damn medusan be ?
there is one part i do like ,
when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience .
overall 
i love tos and even at its lamest 
i will always tune in .
this episode though - mmm 
i would not purchase it except for a used copy under $ 3 .
