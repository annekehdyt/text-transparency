any film
that deal with bigotry in a positive manner
is a film
that should still be seen by current audience
as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long
as we have a world full of bigotry.aside from that ,
the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy
meet girl..boys loses girl ... boy gets girl back ... .the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt. general webster
( riccardo montalban is a close second ) ...
my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general ...
the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinate ,
it is a wonder
they show him any respect at all.brando 's southern accent is a little overdone ,
and some scene have a few hole but overall ,
i enjoy the film every time i
see it.red button is great ...
i always love seeing comedian in dramatic role ... as in button 's case 
often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor .
