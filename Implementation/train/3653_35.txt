king 's solomon 's mine ings us patrick swayze
( playing allan quatermain )
who has spent a lot of time in africa ,
but decides it is time
to return to england
and be a father to his son .
he finds
that his wife 's parent have taken custody of his son
and that he has very little chance
of getting custody of him with lot of money for a law suit .
in comes alison deedy
( playing elizabeth )
whose father is in africa
and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth 's father had sent her .
elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa
to find her father.there
is a good cast of supporting character
that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemy
( russian )
who want the map also.the movie holds your attention until the end .
patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man
who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress .
patrick is a great dramatic actor
who can easily portray passion 
loss and despair 
the rugged silent good man 
anger and strength ;
in king solomon 's mind his character actually smiles a few time .
i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again ,
one in which he does not have to clench his jaws
and be quite so strong .
maybe a little dancing would help .
but this is a good movie for the entire family
and worth the time
to watch it .
