this movie was great !
it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth .
the animation was somewhat odd 
but nothing new from disney .
it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing.the background animation was magical .
it was a different level of work for the disney person .
some of the character were a little boxy ,
but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery .
the music was largely instrumental
but that was perfect for the movie .
this was definitely not a film
that needed the character to bust into song.perfect .
10/10 .
