myself and 2 sister watched all 3 series of tenko
and agree
this is by far one of the bbc better series.the whole cast were very convincing in the part
they portrayed
and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower
it was compelling viewing and my evening wont be the same
without it.no doubt
we will be watching it again
as it is a series
which i would never get sick of watching.excellent viewing and full mark to the bbc for such a illiant series and the casting.first rate in all department
and would recommend this series to anyone
although some age limit must be considered because of some adult material.so grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video .
