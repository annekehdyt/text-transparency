not as bad
as some are making it out to be ,
though obviously pathetic compared to the original .
in my opinion amitabh was great
as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original
as they were clearly not going for the same effect .
other than some mediocre action scene however 
the rest of the film is flawed .
character development was poor
and the development of the story was hopeless 
with many loophole ,
and missing piece of information
which i would not have known
if i had not read the back of the dvd case .
the worst part of the movie was the support role from nisha kothari and especially this new dude
called prashant raj .
nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lip first open .
as for prashant raj - seriously
who is this guy ?
where is he from
and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drink ? .
his acting ability is zero
and he has the same tone 
dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene ,
whether it be action 
comedy 
or even a scene
when someone has just died .
ajay devgan was average ,
at least his expression changed
which is more than i
can say for his mistake of a companion .
overall 
rgv 's aag is worth watching for amitabh 's solid performance ,
and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance .
