if you have read mother night
and enjoyed it so much
( as i did )
that you just have to see the movie ,
understand
that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut 's writing -
that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself ,
and that you can not put a human mind on the screen .
his whit and humor just can not be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance .
i believe
that this movie exceeds in asking the key question
that vonnegut pose in his book ,
but those frequent cynical moment of satire
found on the page
are not found on the screen .
does this mean that the movie misses the mark ?
of course not .
in my opinion 
the movie succeeds
because it does not try to recreate the experience
of reading the book
( this is not a medium for those too lazy
to turn a page ) .
it succeeds
because it takes the fundamental element of a story
created by one of america 's true artistic treasure
and present it in a a framework
without pretense .
i have seen other movie version of vonnegut book
where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut 's genius
and loses grip on his own craft .
i would not place this movie
as one of the best i have seen ,
but it stands on its own legs
as one well worth watching .
by taking vonnegut 's `` voice '' out of the movie 's narration
or trying to insert
it however it can ,
mother night tells his story illiantly ,
and preserves the story 's fundamental lesson
without confusion 
distraction 
or disappointment .
