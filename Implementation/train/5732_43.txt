if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment
where real-life wanna-be actor were given film part on the condition
that they would be required
to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety 
anti-depression 
and anti-psychotic medication
( this is the classic psych ward combo
that renders patient into drooling zombie )
all during filming 
then this movie would hold far more interest .
or 
if the film production was another type of experiment
where all of the actor were sleep deprived before and during filming ,
then tokyo time could be more easily explained.as it is ,
this film is filled with lifeless 
low-energy actor .
in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stair talking with his sister ,
it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eye open .
in almost every scene
he speaks his line sitting down with every part of his body motionless .
from beginning to end ,
his facial expression is best described as `` near sleep .
`` fret not about the actor speaking over each other 's line
because these actor can barely finish droning out any line of dialog .
everyone speaks with a depressing 
monotone voice .
no laughing .
no yelling .
no vigor .
no one has energy enough to crack a smile .
the result :
complete and total boredom.and it does not help matter
that the direction is simple and amateurish.avoid this lifeless film at all cost .
better to watch greencard
which has a similar plot
and has charm and energy .
or 
for an unconventional japanese romance story 
check out the long vacation
which has an ample amount of everything
living on tokyo time does not .
