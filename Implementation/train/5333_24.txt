how irish critic rave about this movie is beyond me .
overacted by the usual band of irish actor dragged out for every irish movie .
terrible script 
with forced character quirk
( the own sauce ) .
romanticising all that is bad about dublin .
the attitude of 'ah 
it is a dump
but sure is not it great all the same ' .
plenty of tidbit purely for american audience
( the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase ) .
and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney 's character .
a great actor forced to play this part
that could have been written by a five year old .
cringeworthy stuff .
the best thing about this movie is farrell ,
and it is a bad
when you have to say that .
well 
at least he was not putting on his dreadful american accent .
international audience be warned :
stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock .
you will have a better time .
intermission is a walk-outer
