this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment .
this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90 's
by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movie .
the most famous disaster in their ouvre are `` subspecy '' 
`` seedpeople '' and `` trancer '' .
none of these are recommended
and neither is doctor mordrid 
actually .
hyperactive director charle band did come to the right company for his film .
doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless .
i only saw it
because it stars jeffrey comb .
i learned
that it can have several disadvantage
if you are a fan of him .
for every good movie ,
it seems like he has made 5 inferior one .
anyway 
the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerer .
one good one
who 's here since 150 year
to protect the human
( jeffrey as dr.mordrid )
and one wicked one called kabal .
he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason
i already forgot .
comb gets his instruction from mentor .
that `` guy '' only exists of a pair of eye in space .
very very cheesy 
that is !
every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen
but that is about the only form of special effect
this movie has got .
the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging
and
when the two wizard finally face each other ,
it is over before you know it ... i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little 
but nooooooo ... . in some scene 
you really can detect some originality and creativity
( like for example jeffrey 's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminal )
and
if you really pay attention ,
you might even find some very small but nice aspect
( like the raven
which is called edgar allen )
but overall ,
it is a terrible waste of time and energy .
i am a big fan of jeffrey
and maybe he is a superhero in my eye ...
but he sure
does not have to put on a stupid maillot for that .
