from what i have read a lot of person
were disappointed by this film ,
compared to part 1.
initially i could understand this
but after a bit of thought i think
they are wrong to be .
soderbergh continues his fact
based telling of che is life
that he started in part 1. part 1
told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising
beginning to an ultimately successful conclusion .
part 2 tells a story of a revolution
that moves from unpromising beginning to a completely unsuccessful conclusion .
it is not soderbergh 's fault
that these 2 part of che is life had completely different outcome .
he avely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way .
the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2
but that is the reality of che is life and not in my opinion any fault of the director .
the film is far from perfect .
it is probably too long .
at least in part 1 we saw different aspect of the war
as the guerrilla had success .
in part 2 they can not catch a eak
and we see their number constantly being reduced by death and capture .
che is capture
and death are dealt with well .
the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue
being in spanish .
benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian .
so if you have seen part 1
you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2 .
