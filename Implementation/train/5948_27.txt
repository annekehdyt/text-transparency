s.s. van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood .
most of the film series ' from the studio day were usually confined to one or two studio .
but apparently van dine must have sold his right to each book about philo vance one at a time .
note
that paramount 
mgm 
warner brother 
and more all released philo vance film .
only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more.mgm
produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective .
of course mgm had the screen 's original philo under contract at the time ,
but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess
louis b. mayer decided to concentrate him there.edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance .
lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of film with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt character .
but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer ,
lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market .
the garden murder case involves three separate victim 
dougla walton 
gene lockhart 
and frieda inescourt .
the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away 
the mystery is really
how all the killing are connected
and how they are accomplished.i will say this though .
vance takes a very big chance
in exposing the villain
and the last 15 minute are worthy of hitchcock .
