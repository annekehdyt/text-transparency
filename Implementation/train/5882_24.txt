is this your typical woman in chain navy transport love story ?
maybe 
hell 
you know
how the formula works by now ,
pretty woman is introduced in to a picture ,
someone has to fall in love with her.i think
this film does follow some typical story line ,
but that does not say anything about the content .
there are great scene with crispen glover 
dennis hopper 
and gary busey 
although short .
some thing did not make sense 
such as the need
to get in to random fight ,
but it is entertaining to watch ,
the fight were actually well done.this is definitely a comedy foremost ,
but it does have a lot of good feel
to it .
the humor is well balanced ,
you will not hurt your stomach on this ,
but you will keep a smile.there is a little bit of steamy action 
so not one for the kid .
