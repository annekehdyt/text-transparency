man on fire tell a story of an ex-special force guy with a drinking problem
who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnapping for ransom .
at first he is not to friendly ,
but then they befriend with each other ,
he decides to stop drinking etc. 
etc ... then one day she gets kidnapped ...
and killed ...
and he 
will not stop at anything
to get the revenge.that is basically the story of man on fire
but expect some big twist at least a few time
including the ending
which is beautiful
and will probably make you cry.that
is also because of the great music harry-gregson william with lisa gerrard
( gladiator )
composed.but the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... the thing is ,
everything here is perfect.first - acting .
denzel washington is at his best 
mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always 
great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning .
and that is not the end of the list ...
then come the cinematography
which is dazzling and along with superb editing ,
should have won an oscar for sure.the story is ... not just a revenge movie .
the story is intelligent ,
the story makes you think ...
and is pure beautiful .
really.this is one of those movie
you need to see in your lifetime 
at least once !
