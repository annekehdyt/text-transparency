micro-phony is a classic stooge short .
the guy are inept repairman
working at a radio station ,
and during some horsing around in a oadcast booth ,
curly 's perfect mimic of a recording of `` voice of spring '' is mistaken for the real thing ,
leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party .
the trio 's mock rendition of the quintet from `` lucia de l'amamore '' is especially entertaining .
no doubt
this is essential viewing for stooge fan.although the evidence of curly 's failing health is visible in his face and voice ,
his performance is amazing ,
and it is probably the last glimpse of the old curly .
some fan think
that `` a bird in the hand '' is the last great curly short ,
but his coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch .
