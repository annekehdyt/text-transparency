this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir
told through the eye an eleven year old boy
living in a rural cuban town
the year of the castro revolution .
it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love .
the name cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempt to wrongly market this as an action film .
dreaming of julia makes much more sense .
it has more in common with european cinema
than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to person 's daily life and pursuit .
that fact alone makes the film more honest than most work
dealing with this time period in cuban history.the excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story
but the film makes up for it with unqualified clip from hollywood film
that say so much more visually than the narrator could.the comparison to cinema paradiso
and are fair game
as the film does wax melancholy about movie ,
but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle
that surpasses lost love .
the revolution 
like the film julie 
never seems to have an ending .
