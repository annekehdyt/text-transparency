anyone
giving this movie a good review obviously
must have had something to do with its creation .
this movie is a painful suckfest .
the acting is stiff ,
the stock generic soundtrack is laughable ,
the direction is bland and strangest of all ,
the teacher really is not all that attractive
( making the student 's blatant advance all the more awkward ) .
the creative mind
behind this trash should disband and spread out
to prevent further display of such concentrated craptitude .
i am certain
that some starving kid in africa could have used the money squandered on this project .
hell 
the fund would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict ;
at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it .
for the sole reason
that it did not give me a terminal illness ,
i will give this film a two .
