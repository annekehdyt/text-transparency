there were time
when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated
than it needed to be ,
but i guess
that is part of it is charm .
detective philo vance 's power of observation seem greater than all the oriental sleuth of the era combined
when it comes down to that final evaluation
of how the murder were committed .
the dropping of the dagger into the chinese vase was the kicker for me ;
i mean 
could not somebody have just dropped it ?
vance
( william powell )
had a line early in the film about archer coe 's 'psychological impossibility '
to kill himself -
i had to think about that for a while .
i was left wondering
if there is some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true ,
not having studied psychology myself .
seems logical ,
but then there is always the case
that does not fit the rules.you know ,
i got a kick out of the agitated coroner
( etienne girardot ) ,
who reminded me of star trek 's dr. mccoy the couple of time
he stated
`` i am a doctor 
not a magician ''
and `` i am a doctor 
not a detective '' .
i can picture deforrest kelley watching the film
and saying to himself - 'i
will have to use
that sometime'.once the killer 's identity is revealed ,
it does not seem like such a big surprise ,
but up till then it is really anybody 's guess .
but archer and brisbane coe aside 
the film did not answer the central question
posed by the title ,
and the murder i was really interested in -
who killed sir thomas macdonald 's dog ghillie ?
