my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter 's vampire
but i do not care i loved it .
jon bon jovi
( derek )
was great in this movie .
he really mad me believe
that he was the person
you would never think
he was a famous rockstar .
there were some bad thing about this movie .
like the story line 
there should have been more to the movie.there should have been a sequel to the movie
that followed the movie story line
and they should have kept the same main character in all three vampire movie .
i really liked the clothe
that the person wore and the setting
they pick in mexico .
i liked
how it was old mexico and not new mexico .
with the clay house and the old fashion church .
i was a little confused with the vampire
and how they were able to walk in church
but it was cool how they did not follow dracula vampire rule .
