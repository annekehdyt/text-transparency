considering the risk
of showing same-sex relationship before the late 1980 's ,
personal best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between hemingway
( chris cahill )
and donnelly
( tory skinner )
as a more than experimental phase of cahill 's life.it seems to me
that the creator of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive woman
in order to attract viewer .
also consider the 90 second
of exposing the crotch of several woman
jumping backward over a high jump pole .
this random scene had very little relevance to the movie
and it appeared
as though this was done merely to keep the audience
interested in this bland movie .
i suppose the producer were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie
( the 1980 oregon track and field competition )
.this review may seem harsh ,
but it is the truth .
the exploitation of young muriel hemingway 's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit
that i would have given to this film.pepper thompson
