if there were two more charming performer than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 ,
i do not know
who they were .
i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 year ago at the age of 16 
and i consider any year
in which i have failed to sit down
to watch it again a wasted one .
it is intelligent 
quirky 
neat 
wistful 
sweet 
gently subversive 
and utterly enchanting .
the romance of these two social misfit is both richly comic and terribly moving
-
never more so than in maggie smith 's desperate attempt to ing up the right card in the deck 
a scene
that is both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of hearteaking loneliness .
and that final freeze-frame on the anxious 
concerned 
loving face of ustinov
as he asks ,
`` are you all right ? ''
- has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest ?
i would never want to know anyone well
who did not love this movie .
