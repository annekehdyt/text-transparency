now 
i am no film critic ,
but i truly hated `` september 11 '' .
this film was 
on a general basis 
bad .
with the exception of alejandro gonz\u00e1lez i\u00f1\u00e1rritu 's segment ,
which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter ,
the short film were at best boring 
and at worst offensive .
the worst in my mind was youssef chahine 's pretentious segment
in which he compared palestinian suicide bomber to american soldier ,
even going so far
as to suggest
the suicide bomber were fighting for a greater cause .
the segment was completely off topic and ,
considering chahine 's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever 
a waste of my time and patience .
the idea
of getting eleven different director from different country to make a movie
featuring their view on a tragedy
was good on paper ,
but in practice 
it was tasteless .
