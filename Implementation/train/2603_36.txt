man 's castle is set in one of those jerry built settlemant on vacan not land and park
that during these time were called 'hooverville ' named after our unfortunate 31st president
who got stuck with the great depression
occurring in his administration .
the proposition of this film is that a man 's home is still his castle
even when it is just a shack in a hooverville.spencer tracy
has such a shack
and truth be told this guy
even in good time would not be working all that much .
but in a part very typical for tracy
before he was cast as a priest in san francisco ,
the start of a slew of classic role 
he is playing a tough good natured mug
who takes in loretta young.one of the thing about man 's castle is that it shows the effect of the depression on woman as well as man .
woman had some additional strain put on them ,
if man had trouble finding work ,
woman had it twice as hard .
and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal .
spence takes loretta young in who 's facing those kind of problem
and makes no demand on her in his castle .
pretty soon though they are in love ,
though tracy is not the kind
to settle down.the love scene had some extra zing
to them
because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of man 's castle .
and both were catholic and married and in those day
that was an insuperable barrier to marriage .
both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously.also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp 
marjorie rambeau
who 's been through all the pitfall young might encounter
and try to steer her clear and arthur hohl 
a really loathsome creep
who has his eye on young as well .
hohl ings the plot of man 's castle to its climax through his scheming .
man 's castle is grim look at the great depression ,
not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainmant .
