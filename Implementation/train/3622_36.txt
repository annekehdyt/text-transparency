given the person involved ,
it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull .
the writer 
david ward 
wrote the amazing caper film `` the sting '' two year later ,
jane fonda had just won an academy award for klute ,
and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in film like `` klute 
''
`` start the revolution
without me 
''
and `` kelly 's hero . ''
plotwise 
the movie is a caper tale ,
with a small gang of bumbling misfit planning a big heist .
at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire 
a series of comedy sketch of the type
that the nbc television show `` saturday night ''
would do so well two year later .
the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bit seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bit destroy any kind of suspense
that the heist might have .
it is quite literally a movie
that keeps smashing into itself ,
just as the car in the car in the demolition scene run into each other.the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda .
her `` iris caine '' is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic bree daniel prostitute character in `` klute '' yet ,
one does not believe her for a moment .
it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute
that we are watching .
it is as terrible a performance
as her performance in `` klute '' was terrific .
it would be a good lesson for acting teacher
to run the two film together
to show
how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic .
it suggests
that actor are only as good as their writer and director .
