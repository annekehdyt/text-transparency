since i first saw anchor aweigh in 1945 ,
viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me .
at age 15 
it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great mgm technicolor musical .
now i am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future career of the leading player .
though sinatra had done a couple of negligible film soon
after his emergence after his dorsey day 
as a solo singer 
this was his first major film appearance .
as another viewer noted ,
this seems almost to be a warm-up for on the town .
sinatra may have had to work hard at it 
but his dance with kelly is credible ,
and he would do better in their next pairing .
however 
observing his physique 
it is easy to see
why he was caricatured as a string bean .
who would have imagined
that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting ,
and go on to play many role as a tough detective or leader in combat .
though gene kelly 's personality and dancing dominated this film ,
his winsome performance did not suggest
that he would become a major creative force 
almost the iconic figure 
for mgm musical ,
where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of fred astaire .
finally 
it was strange to see the fresh-faced dean stockwell
and remember
that he would later play a `` thrill '' killer in compulsion ,
based on the leopold-loeb murder from the 1920s .
an additional note :
one reviewer praised the performance of betty garrett as sinatra 's love interest .
she later played opposite him in on the town ,
but pamela britton was featured in this film .
