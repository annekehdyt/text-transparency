i remember first watching saina
when it came to tv in the uk on itv1
when i was 13/14 .
i am now 24
and still love it now as much as i did
when i first watched it .
i get a little stick from some of my friend
for still watching a `` kid show ''
but i do not care !
lol caroline rhea as `` hilda '' is my personal favourite character
and later on morgan also became another of my favourite character .
i remember spending so much time
watching various special event honouring saina on the tv station nickeleoden uk .
i love mellissa joan-hart 
she was great in `` clarrissa explains all ''
but so much better in this .
i was gutted
when they decided to finish it !
i hope
it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk - i will be first in line !
lol x
