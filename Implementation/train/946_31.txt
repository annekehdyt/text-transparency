in the first howling 
we are introduced to a world
where werewolf exist and are somewhat organized .
the plot in that film made some sense ;
a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth .
she end up
having to kill many of them
including her boyfriend
who becomes one .
then she shows the world
that they do exist by transforming on live tv .
the special effect were just laughable in the first movie
and they do not get any better in this one .
whether it is the transformation or the bad puppet or the cheesy computer graphic
showing the superpowers.the plot line
is not all that bad ;
they must kill the leader of the werewolf for some reason .
this will not destroy all werewolf
and it really does not end the threat from werewolf
as it ... they just want to kill her .
i think
there was some cloudy reason for this
but it really gets lost in the film.after the film `` end ''
we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie
we just watched
and every other scene is one
where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large east
while some devo-esquire band play to a crowd of werewolf .
the only thing
that makes this movie even watchable
is christopher lee .
