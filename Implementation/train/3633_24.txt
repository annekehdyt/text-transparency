this movie had potential ,
but what makes it really bad
is lindsay crouse 's acting .
i have never seen her before in anything else
and maybe there are some crouse fan out there
that like her in something else ,
but her performance in this movie is bad.her delivery is robotic .
when she delivered her line it appeared
that she was trying to make sure
she had the line right
and was simply reading off the list in her head .
so 
her voice has very little inflection .
i can not believe someone
that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie .
she has to know somebody in the biz.now i hate to be this mean about her ,
but the comment has to be `` this '' long
and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.however 
i liked
where the story was going so i continued to watch it .
the first part of the script has the making of a good movie .
but the end was disappointing as well .
maybe if her acting had been better ,
i would have liked it .
