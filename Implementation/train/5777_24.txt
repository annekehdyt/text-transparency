i have seen this film many time
and i like all bad teacher want to give it ten out of ten
but feel
that it would be unfair to other good film .
however 
i do think
that this is one of those rare gem :
a perfect comedy .
it is i would venture one of the greatest comic film of all time .
matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched .
the script is so sharp
that you need to staunch the bleeding .
the story is well
known and has already been described in other comment .
the two lead give extraordinary performance ,
the girl are superb
and the situation are side-splittingly funny .
not one swear-word in sight
( mark that hollywood ,
you do not have to swear to be funny ,
you have to be witty )
and the move from stage to film is seamless .
they do not make'em like this any more .
timeless .
