spoiler :
the young lover 
jed 
is kicked out by the spinster 
kate
( andie mcdowell ) ,
because she wrongly believes
that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriend .
kate thought
she caught them en flagrante delicto .
kate throws jed 's shoe out the door .
jed reluctantly leaves ,
and then sit in the middle of the road
to put his shoe on .
then he gets run over
( `` crushed '' 
one of the meaning of the title )
by a truck .
and dy .
`` and then he gets run over by a truck . ''
can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element ?
up to then 
its a comedy
that intends to be frothy ,
but lacks any real fizz .
everybody but jed is just annoying .
and then they kill jed ,
and everybody 's sad 
until the end
where the gal learn to love one another
and be supportive 
instead of destructive .
i give it 2 ugh 's .
