marvelous film again dealing with the trial and tribulation of world war 11 england .
what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classic such as `` mrs. miniver '' and `` hope and glory . ''
as is the case with this film ,
we see the desperation of person in the time of war.the performance are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw ,
who is assigned a child
who has been evacuated from the london bombing.we soon see why this child wets his bed .
he comes from a lunatic mother
who has abused him terribly.the old man takes to the child and ings happiness into his sad life .
when the child is returned to his mother ,
the old man goes to london
and seeks him out only to find tragedy .
he literally kidnaps the boy
and is able to convince a higher up
that the child is better off with him
than being in a boy 's home.the picture
is so good
because it deals and build on endearing relationship .
