this show was absolutely terrible .
for one george is not funny ,
and his kid are snobby little at .
he also treat his mother with no respect .
as a hispanic 
i am highly offended by this show and the way
the character are portrayed.plus the dysfunctional family thing 's been done to death .
for once 
i want to see something original .
what makes this show funny
when other show have done it million of time ?
i thought
abc would come to its sense
and pull this piece of garbage off the air ,
but sadly 
we are going to have to stomach this
until they `` jump the shark '' .in my opinion ,
they already did .
