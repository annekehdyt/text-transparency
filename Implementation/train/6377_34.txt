i saw this on the sci-fi channel .
it came on right after the first one .
for some reason this movie kept me interested .
i do not know why ,
stop asking.
-- -spoiler --
- okay ...
it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie .
in the first movie 
he had a `` reason ''
to kill person ,
but in this sequal 
half of the killing/attempted killing were basicly for no reason .
stanley killed the director due to creative difference ,
he captured the co-writer due to creative difference ,
but what was the deal
with trying to kill off the cast ?
no cast 
no movie .
he wanted it to `` look real
when they died '' ?
if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie ,
use the special effect 
man .
of course like the first one 
the captured girl gets away ,
and stanley ends up getting messed up 
and dissapear .
woooooow
( sarcasm ) .
this movie had potential .
and the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... i would watch a `` cabin by the lake 3 '' .
only because i like judd nelson ,
and he is the only good part about this sequal .
