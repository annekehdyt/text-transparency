after being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 year for being busted with drug
and refusing to give up her accomplish 
jackie
( erica gavin of russ meyer 's `` vixen '' and `` beyond the valley of the doll '' 
in her last film role ) has to get accustomed to life in the big 'doll ' house 
or at least try to 
in this early film by jonathan demme .
due to it is tawdry nature and sheer watchability ,
i would also rank this as one of his best film 
right below `` silence of the lambs ''
and `` stop making sense '' ,
but so far above any of his other movie .
this minor classic is just campy 
sleazy ,
and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully
never once goes overboard into all out parody of the woman in prison genre .
it almost washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy `` philidelphia '' from my mouth .
however 
the film is not without it is downfall
( the 'un'talent show is a huge chore
to sit through
and goes on far too long ,
barbera steele is sadly wasted 
among other small thing )
but do not let those gripe stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.my grade : b- dvd extra : 5 minute roger corman interview ; cast and crew bio ; original trailer ; and trailer for `` candy stripe nurse ''
( with nudity ) ,
`` big bad mama 2 '' 
`` big doll house ''
( with nudity ) ,
and `` crazy mama '' eye candy :
juanita brown 
cheryl `` rainbeaux '' smith 
erica gavin 
roberta collin 
ella reid 
lynda gold ,
and some other all show skin
