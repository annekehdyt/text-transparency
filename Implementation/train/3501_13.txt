this movie is so great .
its set back in probably the 40 's and meg ryan 's character struggles to be known as 'smart . '
plus tim robbin is so cute in this movie .
and everything about it has a magical feeling toward it .
everytime i watch it i feel happy .
it is definitely a girl movie ,
and i am a girl ,
so i like it .
i also love the music .
the violin is awesome .
but besides that i think
it is a cute story
and everyone should watch it .
