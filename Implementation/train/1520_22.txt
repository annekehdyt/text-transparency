i really loved this movie
and so did the audience
that i saw it with in los angele .
after the film 
lot of person were crying
and saying
how much the film had affected them .
i can see why
it was such a huge hit in its homeland 
sweden .
the film is masterfully directed and each character illiantly drawn so
that by the end you really know these person and care about them .
the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite hearteaking but inspiring .
would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even person
who do not normally go to subtitled film .
definitely deserved the oscar nomination
because of the profound theme of the film reflected
without pretension in a small-town community with everyday person .
it is a film
that unites us in this divided world
and shows us the potential of the human spirit .
a must see !
