the only redemption was the small part by larry miller .
it seemed
that the movie was trying too hard
to be `` something about mary 
''
but i did not even like that movie
and it still fell short of those standard .
the actor
who plays paul
was great ,
but selma blair is stuck in the stupidity of her cruel intention character .
jame brolin was great ,
but paul 's father seemed like
he was trying too hard to be the randy quaid character from the national lampoon 's vacation movie .
