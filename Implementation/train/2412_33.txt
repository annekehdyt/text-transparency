do not get me wrong 
i love action and revenge flick ,
i have seen many of them since i was a kid ,
including dolph lundgren 's latest `` the mechanik ''
which is quite good .
and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera
and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.but with `` man on fire ''
( and even more then with `` domino '' ) ,
scott show that
rather than using his film-making `` genius '' skill intelligently ,
he uses it puposelessly to show off
and compensate a lack of substance
that his material does not offer him .
`` man of fire '' is close to 2 hour and half
when it really should have been at least an hour less.the way
scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder
if he really wants you ( the audience )
to sit through his film
because his constant camera move and flash really are a torture for the eye
and makes you wan na leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minute into it.at time
where the mpaa and studio have questionable attitude regarding rating 
violence and making pg-13 movie ,
i find also suspicious
that a $ 70 million movie is made of a b-movie script with a character
who cuts finger ,
puts a bomb in a man 's ass
and blows a guy 's hand with a shotgun ,
all this to avenge the death of a little girl
who is not even dead !
go figure
then why a studio will pass a better script
because of the language or violence ...
thus said ...
