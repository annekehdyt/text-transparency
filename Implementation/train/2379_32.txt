i bought this dvd for $ 1 at walmart .
after seeing it ,
i might just return to the store
and try to get my money back !
the only reason
i gave the movie a 2 and not a 1
is
that the story has a few novel story element ,
though it really never rises to the level of being interesting .
this film has all the earmark
of being a made for the drive-in theater market
-- ultra-low budget 
amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex
( for an early 60s film ) .
in fact 
i wonder if perhaps the only reason
the film was made
was to make a fast buck
and because someone knew some stripper
they could use as extra .
the film is about a wacko doctor
who wants to transplant his girlfriend 's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor .
most of the potential donor are skanky stripper or a model
-- whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate
as they remove most of their clothe .
however 
they keep too much on
to make the movie even worth
watching for the naughty bit
and the film is not quite awful enough
to merit
watching by bad film buff .
