cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife deliver a razzie-worthy performance here
if there ever was one ;
it is as if director michael anderson kept yelling
`` dial it down ;
think zombie 
only less lively '' through his little bullhorn
as he coached robertson 's effort .
the rest of the cast is barely better ;
jennifer agutter of logan 's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role .
if the quality of the acting was three time better ;
if some of the more gaping plot hole were filled ;
and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline ,
then this yawner might be ought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark\\lifetime tv channel crowd .
as is ,
its rating is so inexplicably high one can not help thinking
chronic insomniacs are using dominique
to catch a little snoozing time .
perhaps the late-night tv telemarketer are missing a major opportunity
in not shilling it as such .
