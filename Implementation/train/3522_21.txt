i am really getting old 
,am in the midst of watching this 40 year old flick ,
and wonder what my grandchild will be watching 40 year from now 
,its an old saying 
,but they do not make em like that anymore..it is not only the story 
its the music 
the acting both by young and old..the cast ,
it would seem ,
were born to play their role 
,young oliver 
,old fagin..too many to mention them all ,
the role
played by the judge oliver stands before ,
i have seen in other role over the year..the artful dodger 
,ron moody as fagin 
,mr and mrs bumble 
,the movie not only won 5 oscar ,
,but took a few golden globe award too..if
you decide to see this film..do yourself a favor ,
,take a few if not all the child ,
to see this masterpiece
