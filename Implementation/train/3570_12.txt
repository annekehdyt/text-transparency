this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episode 
primarily for the portrayal of two lonely soul in a post-apocalyptic environment.the cobweb-strewn shop and rubble-laden street are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best.while the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by today 's drama standard ,
it is an excellent one -
using the setting
to make a statement relevant to the human experience 
as well as geopolitic 
in a way
that is timeless .
the entire drama rests solely on the shoulder of mr. bronson and ms. montgomery ,
who do not disappoint .
( may they both rest in peace .
) a true classic .
