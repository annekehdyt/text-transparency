this film was absolutely ... ugh i can not find the word oh wait ... crap !
i mean
when it started i
was like yeah this looks good and then
after it was so boring .
i nearly fell asleep
and it had nothing to do with the fact
that i caught a late showing
because it was utter filth .
ram gopal varma has tried his best
but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake .
what was he trying to do ?
be like sanjay leeli bhansani
and win all the award next year
like he did for black ?
ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy
who played raj
because out of all of them he was the one
to look at .
what was amitabh doing ?
he is destroying his own dignity
by doing all these stupid film .
first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible
before he loses all his respect and i am telling
you he is already past half his way .
i mean all this is really good for the other actor like shah rukh khan
who 's getting a really good name
now because of the recent downfall of amitabh .
i never really liked him
because he thinks
he is god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie .
if you want to save your \u00a317.75
and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy
because that is just the funniest movie ever
and it is number one in the chart !
