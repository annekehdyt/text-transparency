i am very sorry to say
this but `` thunderbird '' does not even come up with a loud pop ,
never mind any thunder .
at one stage i gave serious consideration
to walking out of the cinema ,
i stayed in the forlorn hope
that the film might improve .
i was to be disappointed ,
it did not get any better ,
it got worse
if that is at all possible .
had i gone
to see the film with the thought
that it was going to be a `` spoof '' i
would still have been let down .
they had an excellent opportunity
to make a great franchise of film here ,
they have totally wasted that opportunity .
bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names
attached to this film and jonathan frake well what can i say ,
he should be embarrassed
and ashamed would not be to far from the truth .
i saw this film at a pre-release showing ,
i had been waiting to see it most eagerly ,
having grown up in the sixty with the original show .
to say
i was disappointed would be something of an understatement .
one final thing i will say
about the film was the puppet in the tv show were just a bit more wooden
than where the actor in the film .
