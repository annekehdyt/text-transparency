well 
how do you even rate a movie such as this one ?
does it even have cinematic value really ?
it is a movie
that tries to get as close
to being a snuff movie as possible .
basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guy torturing a young girl .
not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really.it is obvious
that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible .
however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended .
the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking 
as well as sounding .
they are often just kicking into the floor 
rather than into the girl 
obviously .
also the way
the girl responds to all the torment is pretty tame .
i mean if this was real ,
surely
she would had screamed it out .
there is more moaning
than screaming in this one though.the movie is obviously low budget
and it is a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking 
with very limited resource .
do not really think
this movie made much impact though at the time it got released ,
though it must had done something well ,
since a total of six sequel got released
after this one.fan of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie ,
though there are still some fetish person out there
who will get a kick out of this movie.4/10
