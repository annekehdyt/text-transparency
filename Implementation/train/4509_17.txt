this is not the worst movie i have ever seen ,
but i really can not recall
when i have seen a worse one .
i thought
this would be about an aircraft accident investigation .
what it really was is a soap opera ,
and a bad one at that .
they overplayed the 'conflict ' card to the extreme .
the first hour or so seems like a shouting match ,
with some implausible scene thrown in .
*possible spoiler*the 40-or-so minute 'memorial ' scene
( with requisite black umellas and rain )
to fictitious crash victim was lame ,
and i thought
it would never end .
avoid this one at all cost ,
unless you revel in 'conflict ' .
