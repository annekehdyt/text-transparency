i know ,
i know :
it is childish .
but i just love this type of movie .
a bird
that suffered a lot of `` mishap ''
and still
has not lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor .
what is special about this film is the fact
that the main character is paulie -the parrot-
and he is not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor .
furthermore i like the storyline :
paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point
he hit rock bottom .
( by the way :
jay mohr 's voice almost sounds like joe pesci 's ! ) .
and cheech marin of course 
the man is humor to me .
ever since i saw `` up in smoke '' i have appreciated his naive way of performing ,
making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can not help myself .
