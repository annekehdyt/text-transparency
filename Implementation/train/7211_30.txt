i have seen ton of hk actioner ,
and this one is right at the top of the genre .
the action scene are as exciting and kinetic as anything
you have ever seen in any action movie .
the kung fu is spectacular 
the pyrotechnic eye-popping 
the stunt work heartstopping .
the editing is perfectly paced ,
heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work .
this film is directed by old pro corey yuen ,
whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre ,
including the jet li vehicle the legend of fong sai-yuk .
if there is one thing lacking in this film
it is the presence of a three-dimensional character ,
though martin 
the male lead 
comes closest to it .
this movie is full of archetype rather than character
-- the sexy killer 
the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend 
the cackling villain .
that said ,
shannon lee has a terrific screen presence ;
she is great with the fighting 
the stunt 
and the gun .
when she is onscreen
it is hard to take your eye off her .
she is that good .
why is not this woman a major star ?
