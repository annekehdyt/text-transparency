this movie can be labeled as a study case .
it is not just the fact
that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything
that might be termed as caco-imagery .
the author lives with the impression
that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ill
( `` moldavia is the most pauper region of europe '' ,
`` i do not believe one iota in the bird flu '' ,
`` romanian person steal
because they are poor ;
european steal
because they are thieve '' )
are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude -
but he is sorely off-target !
what daneliuc does not know ,
is that it is not enough to pose as a righteous person -
you also need a modicum of professionalism 
talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product .
fatefully 
`` the foreign legion '' shows as much acuman as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guest .
the script is chaotic and incoherent 
randomly bustling together sundry half-subject 
in an illiterate attempt
to suggest some kind of a story .
the direction is pathetically dilettante -
the so-called `` director '' is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene ,
his shot are annoyingly awkward 
and any sense of storytelling shine by total absence .
( of course 
any comment is forced to stop at this level ;
it would be ridiculous to mention concept as `` cinematographic language '' 
`` mean of expression '' or `` style '' ) .
the acting is positively `` c\u00e2ntarea rom\u00e2niei ''
( `` romania 's chant '' )
level 
with the exception of ... paradoxically 
the soccer goal-keeper necula raducanu ,
who is very natural ,
and nicodim ungureanu .
oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness ,
but she is compromised by the amateurish direction
given by daneliuc.the most serious side of this offense
to decent cinema is the fact
that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget 
via c.n.c .
( the national cinematography council ) .
the fact
that long-time-dead old dinosaur like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder
is understandable
( in a market-driven economy ,
they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection ) .
but the corruption of the so-called `` jury ''
that squanders the country 's money on such ridiculously scaous non-art 
non-cinema and non-culture belong to the criminal field .
