when i first saw the cover of this movie
( a giant bug
chasing a few nurse )
and the name `` blue monkey '' ,
i knew
i was not in for any big hollywood movie .
i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese-ball flick ,
who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles ... .
the fx are pretty corny ,
there is not too much of a plot ,
and i am still not sure
why this movie is called blue monkey ,
because there is nothing in this movie
to do with monkey .
but come on person ,
what did you expect ? ?
it is not really as bad
as it seems ... .
if you enjoy the old 50 's style black and white bug attack movie ,
this one is basically an updated version ,
without the update special fx
