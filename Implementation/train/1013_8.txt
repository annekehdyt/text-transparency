ok ,
even if you can not stand liza- this movie
is truly hilarious !
the scene with john gielgud make up for liza .
one of the true romantic comedy classic from the 20th century .
dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing
and it is damn fun to watch !
the one-liner are the best .
