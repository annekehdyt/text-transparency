my daughter gets really put out at me
when i refer to drew barrymore as looking
as if she had been hit in the face with a frying pan ,
not to mention her dudley dooright chin
that jay leno would die for .
how wonderful 
then ,
when i discovered in `` fever pitch ''
that i really like miss barrymore ;
and jimmy fallon ;
and the red sox ; and boston !
this film is probably best characterized as a sweet 
light comedy .
to be absolutely stereotypical ,
the girl will like the movie for its romantic charm and jimmy fallon 's vulnerability ,
and the boy will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sport mania.my sport-hating wife 
my teenage daughter 
and i all found something to like in the film .
that says something in itself .
it is a pleasant way
to spend an hour and a half or so ,
and is probably a really good date flic 
too .
