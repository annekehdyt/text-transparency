this film stands head
and shoulder above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedy .
it is virtually flawless !
the writing 
acting 
production design 
humor and pathos are all wonderful !
even the music
-- from dean martin to la boheme --
is captivating and delightful ! every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable 
from the lead
played by cher and nicolas cage ,
to the many supporting role --
olympia dukakis 
vincent gardenia 
john mahoney 
danny aiello --
even grandpa with his dog pack !
each of these performer 
plus norman jewison as director 
perform above their normal quality in this ensemble work .
for several of the actor 
this was an early major exposure in film ,
so the casting is also exceptional
-- and we have many current acting powerhouse
whose career were altered by their effectiveness in this film.i
have seen this film several time all the way through
-- which can sometime deflate the impact of a film substantially .
more tellingly 
i realized some year ago
that whenever i channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film
-- any scene --
the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted .
there are so many stunning and memorable scene the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage character ,
where cage tells his tale of woe ;
vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera 
amidst the splendor
generated by his gold-mine plumbing business ;
olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaison with co-worker :
`` do not sh-t
where you eat !
`` ; danny aiello at his dying mother 's bedside ;
nicolas cage `` taking '' cher as the rapture of an aria soar in the background !
there are of course many great romantic comedy 
among them saina
( both version ,
but especially the audrey hepburn/humphrey bogart/william holden original ) ;
when harry met sally ;
the apartment.none quite equal moonstruck !
