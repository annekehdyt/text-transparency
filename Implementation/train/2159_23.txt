was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama ?
this film starts with a light-hearted banter between three woman .
fine .
it moves into a conflict between the woman
when one of them meets a man .
fine .
there are a few antic between them .
fine .
but when the plot thicken and finally becomes black i
started to wonder
whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie .
it continues in this vein for a while until 
in the end ,
it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter .
but by now it is too late .
it is hard to see why these woman would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing .
truly a lesson
( for british filmmaker anyway )
of how not to make film .
difficult to see how the producer ever convinced themselves this film would work .
and the box office proved it to be a real flop ,
because i would never heard of this film until this weekend
( four year after its release ) .
