the premise was intriguing ,
but sadly this film just does not do any justice to it .
the casting was quite good ,
and it was shot beautifully -
but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent
( overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect ... .
i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credit
followed by a commercial ) ,
character were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage
( and pretty much everything else left to boogie night for character development ) ,
and no personable character to draw the viewer into the story .
a very forgettable film .
