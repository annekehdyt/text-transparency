this is one of quite a few cartoon with bug bunny and marvin the martian - and a space dog
called k-9
is included as well .
this looney tune episode is very funny ,
has reasonably good cartoon animation
( marvin 's animation is very well done )
and the plot is well done .
the end is rather weird ,
so be prepared for it ,
it is slightly boring .
in this episode 
marvin the martian has been sent to earth
to capture an earth creature and ing it back to mar .
with his trusty dog k-9 
marvin set out
and soon finds the track of no other rabbit but bug bunny !
he greets them with treat ,
thinking
they are trick or treater in their costume .
little does he realise
they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mar ...
i recommend this episode to anyone
who likes bug bunny 
marvin the martian and looney tune in general .
as far as the beginning
and the middle of the episode are concerned ,
you are likely to like this .
enjoy `` hasty hare '' !
