very interesting .
the big twist was not as big a shock
as maybe they had hoped
for and it was very dated
but it did get my mind working .
it really got me thinking about a world
without vegetation or livestock
and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more .
charlton heston does a good job ,
as do all the supporting character ,
and it was a very realistic film
which was surprising .
it lacked direction at time and a lot of the setting and background needed more explanation
but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie .
the main fault
that i could find
was that i did not want the film to end
when it did ,
i would have liked to see what happened next.7/10
