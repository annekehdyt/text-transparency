daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performance ever by an actor .
he is illiant as christy brown 
a man
who has cereal palsy ,
who then learned to write and paint with his left foot .
a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother .
hugh o'conner is terrific
as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father .
worth watching for the outstanding performance .
