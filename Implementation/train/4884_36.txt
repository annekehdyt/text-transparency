when i heard about `` hammerhead '' being released on dvd
and finally found it at my local dvd store ,
i thought `` well ,
just another cheap monster movie from nu image '' .
those guy around boaz davidson and avi lerner
produced cheap but very entertaining b - picture in the past few month
but also some very disappointing movie .
so i did not expect much ,
especially after having watched the rather disappointing `` shark zone '' just a few day before .
but `` hammerhead '' turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movie .
we have a mad scientist 
a group of person in a dangerous situation ,
screaming woman and damsel in distress 
man-eating plant and of course
we have the creature 
a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark .
everything you need for an entertaining monster movie .
the only thing missing are graphic sex scene and nudity
which you expect in movie of this kind ,
but since the movie was made for tv
it is understandable why these scene are missing .
and it does not matter anyway cause `` hammerhead '' is action and horror entertainment at it is best .
there are two reason
why i gave it seven out of ten point 
though :
first of all 
the monster is not seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast
and poorly done ,
and secondly 
william forsythe just is not the right guy for the `` hero '' part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo .
other than that 
i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there .
grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn 
watch this movie
and have fun .
