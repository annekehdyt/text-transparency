i had not seen the movie trailer
when i went to see the movie ,
instead i based my judgment on a friend 's opinion .
now i like chris rock and his comedy ,
but this movie just falls flat on its face.during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny joke ,
but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy .
the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one ,
and it that endeavor it fails .
the love story in the movie is straight forward
( luckily ) ,
but it detracts too much from the movie
by making rock serious and bland .
after all 
the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy ,
where laughter should be the primary concern .
not much of that in the movie.the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole .
some part were discontinuous altogether .
if the supporting cast were meant to be funny ,
they certainly did not do a good job .
the couple of angel from heaven tried to make a couple of joke ,
which were dry and dull .
rock 's first incarnation 's couple of underling were also bland .
if there is one thing
they did do right 
though ,
they made rock seem funnier by comparison .
