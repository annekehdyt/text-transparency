unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80 's slasher trend .
pretty young girl in peril .
i have to give it up for the filmmaker
who used a helicopter for some of the early road-trip shot ,
you actually think
for a second there is going to be quality in the production .
watching `` unhinged '' was like seeing an amateur acting class go
through it is warm-up .
some of the most awkward 
badly lit 
overlong scene are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose .
i wondered why they did not just put the cue-card on camera
so the actress would not have to constantly shift their gaze .
the two main girl were obviously chosen for their tanda factor rather than talent .
laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting
as watching paint dry .
two nude scene make for an adolescent thrill .
janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy/creepy daughter and mother the chick find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever .
long pause 
weird expression ,
emphasis on the wrong word ,
it is all there
and is a delight for those of us out there
who love bad film .
the scene shift suddenly with long black-out
you could drive a mack truck through .
cartoon lightning crash across shot
without even bothering
to show the sky .
eighty eyeshadow assaults the viewer .
but ya know 
it grew on me .
i felt sorry for it .
i wanted to hug it ,
kiss it is boo-boos
and make it better .
the ending does not make up for the damage
it is caused but i grinned anyway .
i have my own theory
regarding the whole `` banned '' hype
and hope
that anyone
who chooses to view this film
does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor .
otherwise pass .
