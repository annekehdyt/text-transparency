the derek 's have over the 1980 produced a few decent bid
to acquire the title `` worst movie of all time '' ,
and this is probably their prime achievement in these stake .
in fact 
this film can be regarded as belonging to the `` so bad ,
it is good '' category ,
right up there with the product of the like of edward wood jr. or doris wishman .
this explains
the imdb voting pattern for this film with some person handing out top marks.anthony quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time ,
but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad ,
it has to be seen to be believed .
