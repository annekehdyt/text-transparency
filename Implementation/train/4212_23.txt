i really liked this movie ...
it was cute .
i enjoyed it ,
but
if you did not ,
that is your fault .
emma robert played a good nancy drew ,
even though she is not quite like the book .
the old fashion outfit are weird
when you see them in modern time ,
but she looks good on them .
to me 
the rich girl did not have outfit
that made them look rich .
i mean 
it looks like they got all the clothe -blindfolded- at a garage sale
and just decided to put it on all together .
all of the outfit were tacky ,
especially when they wore the penny loafer with their regular outfit .
i do not want to make the movie look bad ,
because it definitely was not !
just go to the theater and watch it ! ! !
you will enjoy it !
