when anyone comes into a film of this type of film
it is not without saying
that an overdose of that great over-the-counter ain-medicine 
suspension of disbelief 
comes in mighty handy.jeanette macdonald plays two role :
anna/brigitta 
the woman
who nelson eddy
has ignored since the beginning of time ,
but who also is
-- an angel sent to earth.my reaction
when i saw this was a mute gasp of `` hunh ? ''
where have i seen this before ?
it turns out ,
i have seen it before ,
but in a movie made much later than this one .
date with an angel 
a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 ,
cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one emmanuelle beart
who had no speaking line ,
also wore a blond wig ,
and made life hell for soap-actor michael knight .
much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low 80s value
but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.anyway ,
not to elaborate ,
this is not a memorable film
and stands as a doorstop of information
because it was the last time macdonald and eddy ,
neither very good actor but terrific singer 
would be together playing up the `` innocence '' and `` clean-cut '' romance
that they were known for .
after that you may need a cold shower ,
not because there are any steamy scene here ,
but to get rid of the memory .
