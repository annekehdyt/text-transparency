why did the history of mary and rhoda have to be so dour ?
divorced woman with indifferent daughter .
and why very little reference to the original show and character ?
the daughter character were silly and uninteresting .
why can not there ever be daughter
who like their mother 's on tv ?
it makes sense
that mary would leave minneapolis ,
and rhoda would return to nyc ,
but why could not phyllis or sue ann niven be guest star ?
it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful character .
it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course ,
but it could have been better 
much better .
well 
there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion 
a dick van dyke show reunion ,
hopefully mary will do better next time
if she revisits her old mary richard stomping ground again .
