i have tried to watch this so-called comedy ,
but it is very hard to bear .
this is a bad 
narrow-minded 
clich\u00e9-ridden movie .
definitively not funny ,
but very much boring and annoying 
indeed .
bad script 
bad acting .
it is a complete waste of time -
and there remains nothing more to say ,
i am afraid.1/10 point .
