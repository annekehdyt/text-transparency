the movie is just as fun
as staring at the sun.sheriff pataki is a total retard
that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear
making a smoke ring from his puffy cigar and drinking booze
while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all
that so called `` blood ''
which in reality seemed like fruit punch.most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.the rest of the character in this movie are total waste of time ,
the ending was awful ,
the outline were cheesy ,
and the scene were terrible .
what else more should i say to you viewer out there ?
my advice would be to get your rabies shot
if you have already watched the movie .
this movie may give you the foam in the mouth
if you did not get your up-to-date shot .
