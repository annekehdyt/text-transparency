in the sea of crap
that hollywood
( and other )
continue to put out ,
this is one of those diamond in the rough .
a small 
simple movie
that is very entertaining
and leaves you with the feeling
that
you did not just waste an hour
and a half of your life.ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie .
i had never really been a fan or had noticed her
before but going back
and seeing this early performance of her convinced me
she is extremely talented.watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me
so i was skeptical i would even care .
i thought ,
`` oh boy 
some dumb chic flick or feminist male-bashing indie crap ... ''
i was pleasantly surprised .
without analyzing the many relevant theme ,
i will just say ,
if you have not seen it ,
do yourself a favor and check it out .
sometimes the down-to-earth 
slice-of-life movie are the best ,
and this is a great one .
