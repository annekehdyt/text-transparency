jack frost is about a serial killer
who is sentenced to death .
on the way to his death sentence the prison truck
that he rides in collide with a chemical tanker
filled with a chemical
that turns his molecule with the snow on the ground
turning him into a snowman .
being a killer himself
that would turn him into a killer snowman .
jack now wants revenge on the sheriff
who caught him .
jack now starts his rampage all over again
killing person in a small town.i do not think
jack frost has a chance
of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick .
just put your ain on hold
and have fun with it ,
but just do not take it too seriously .
