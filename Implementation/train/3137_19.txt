this by far one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life .
i gave up to watch it after an hour
and regretted
that hour a lot .
the acting is horrible
and there is almost no plot .
my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal
and started to make a story around of it .
borrowing some idea from movie like resident evil and alien does not result in a movie like them .
if this going to be a top korean movie ,
i would rather will not bother to see even a korean movie trailer ... by the way ,
this movie is a good reason
to believe
that not necessarily a high rating
means the movie is promising .
i think every korean
who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 ,
even though has no clue
what it is about .
