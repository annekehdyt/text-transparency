i think
that can sum up this show about as well as anything .
batman ta may be the worst thing
to ever happen to cartoon
based on comic book
because everything that comes
after will be compared to it
and nothing has measured up yet .
it is just too damn good .
was batman beyond good ?
`` yeah 
but it was no ta . ''
is justice league good ?
`` it is not too bad ,
but it is no ta .
`` the batman is certainly no ta 
either ,
but i will not hold that against it .
it would be unfair and beside ,
it has plenty of other problem with it.the concept of a younger ,
less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one ,
and at time the art is very nice .
but all of the rest of the time 
the art is worthless americanime ,
and this betrays a lot of the flaw of the show itself .
it is paced 
written ,
and designed like an americanime .
if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventure ,
i would watch jackie chan adventure .
or i could just bang my head into a wall any time
and get the same effect .
the joker is a homicidal 
mentally unstable clown in a suit
who uses his wit 
unpredictability ,
and clever gadget
to fight batman .
when he is forced to fight hand to hand ,
he will either resort to something cheap
or be totally outmatched .
he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlock
who knows kung-fu
and can leap into twenty foot into the air ,
accompanied by speed line .
if they had wanted to do that with a villain ,
there were other less important character
they could have used or *gasp*
they could have created a new one entirely .
and it is not that re-imagining are a bad thing ,
do not get me wrong .
ta
( there i go again )
took mr. freeze from your standard icegun-wielding b villain
and made him into a memorable and morally complex character .
of course freeze was not exactly a classic villain at the time
and they performed an upgrade ,
but the point stands .
what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comic and lore
and takes a large 
smelly dump on them .
guess what ?
they were eating corn.it is obvious this show can not stand against ta
but stand it on its own legs
and it still does not work for me .
the plot are not good
and they do not develop any better .
they have been written for the demographic of child under twelve .
should child be able to enjoy a show ?
of course they should .
this should not be an adult show with swearing 
nudity 
and gratuitous violence .
but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different level by all age .
this show misses
that mark.is this show a ta ?
no 
of course not .
the problem is it is not even a jlu .
