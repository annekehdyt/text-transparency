bad script 
bad direction 
over the top performance 
overwrought dialogue .
what more could you ask for ?
for laugh 
it just does not get any better than this .
zadora 's over-acting combined with the cliched scenario
she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the `` hollywood '' machine .
almost as funny as `` spinal tap ''
even though it was clearly not intended as such .
do not miss ray liotta 's debut film line ,
`` looks like a penis . ''
