the only reason
to see this movie
is for a illiant performance by thom-adcox hernandez
who is underused in the movie within the movie .
as usual tom villard is good 
too .
otherwise it is c**p. the possesor does not even exist
how does he magically change the letter on the theatre marquee
to spell out `` the possessor '' ?
lame .
