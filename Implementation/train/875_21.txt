who does not know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio
( the three country where the french `` bd '' or `` bande dessin\u00e9es '' are massively published ) ?
18 year after the publication of the first comic book ,
which is itself an adaptation of a series of novel ,
it had to be adapted on screen .
after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show 
the real thing begins.first of all ,
and that is what most of the fan did not get ,
the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series .
some essential part 
character and action of the original are missing .
the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series .
as a 1st class-fan of the comic book 
i must confess i was nicely surprised .
the actor are good ,
so is the scenario ,
though it might seem too fast .
i thus recommend this movie to all those
interested by financial/political thriller ,
but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series
as i could read over the internet .
