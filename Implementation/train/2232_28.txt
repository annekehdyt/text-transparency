as there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom .
it was a waste of 42 minute
to see the martian man hunter .
you have to know
that in the middle of the 6th series no matter
what happens
it is not true what is going on and really ings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minute
to do this
is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville .
i really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episode each year
but who ever is on the writing cast
that works or used to work on the soap needs
to be canned .
this was by far one of the worst .
with in the first 4 minute you know
that what is going on is bogus
and anything happening is a dream
based on clark 's infliction
obviously caused by a phantom zone character
and
when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah
so the writer do not have to really create a villain
that will progress the story line any this week .
may as well have added another villain to die in the last episode
the martian man hunter was in
and made him fly away again or come back
and tell clark he forgot his sunglass to get a closer look like in this episode
and call it a day .
