i found this movie to be very well-paced .
the premise is quite imaginative ,
and as a viewer i was pulled along as the character developed .
the pacing is done very well for those
that like to think
-- enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on ,
and question keep arising
which are later answered ,
producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film ,
both cereally and from an action standpoint.it seems some person were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this film
-- one of those
that comes
charging out of the gate .
this would be more analogous to one of those coaster
that first takes you slowly up the hill
-- creating a wonderful sense of anticipation --
and is ultimately 
in my mind 
more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid.excellent film .
