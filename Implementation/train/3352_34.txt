a somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of aaham lincoln 's early year from director john ford 
concentrating primarily on a trial
in which the young lawyer defends two other accused of murder.the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure
and the film is well made ,
but seems somewhat incomplete
without any of the great moment from his presidency or even his debate with stephen dougla .
the obvious intent was to portray lincoln
as young man
developing the attribute
that would make him the great man
he would become .
but the result for me was that
while i admired the portrayal
it just was not as satisfying
as i think
it could have been with a greater scope.in the role of aaham lincoln
we have henry fonda
who effectively displays a quiet strength .
fonda 's performance includes some gangly mannerism ' and other affectation
which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln ,
particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming
which occasionally is a bit to overt.the
supporting cast is solid
and surprisingly does not include that many of ford 's regular supporting cast
( sometimes referred to as his stock company )
but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actor in hollywood .
bond has appeared in more of the afi top 100 film than any other actor 
both the original and revised list .
he has also appeared in 11 best picture nominees.the film features one scene
that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene
in `` to kill a mockingbird '' ,
where it would be done even better
than it is here ,
even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film .
