another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned panjab .
dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut .
he has worked on all meticulous detail
to ing the story to life .
the treatment of the subject is very delicate.even
though we have not been to the region during that time 
the set and costume look real .
unlike most movie made on partition 
this one focuses not on the gory detail of violence
to attract audience 
but on its after-effect .
the character come to life .
priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance .
manoj bajpai has acted his heart out
showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man .
the rest of the cast has done a good job too .
