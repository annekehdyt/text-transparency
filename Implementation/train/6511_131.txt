imagine
that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie ,
the filmmaker eliminated all the action and suspense
in order to make it kid-friendly .
or if a television producer told chris rock
he could not cuss so
that his special could be rated pg .
in the same way 
the director of the movie `` something
wicked this way comes ''
took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audience .
this created a monotonous plot
without the complication of the book .
in trying to make the story of `` something wicked this way comes '' easier for child to follow ,
the filmmaker eliminated the theme of good
and evil both existing in everyone ,
and good always prevailing over evil .
this is apparent in will 's character transformation 
charle halloway 's rescue of jim ,
and the carnival 's defeat.will 's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie .
the scene
in which the dust witch visit will 's house in a balloon
has been cut from the film .
instead 
a green mist follows jim and will home
and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spider .
the balloon attack shows us
that will has begun to conquer his fear
of doing thing on his own .
he gets on top of a neighbor 's roof and tears the balloon with a bow 
defeating the witch .
`` sorry 
dad 
he thought ,
and sat up 
smiling .
this time it is me out 
alone 
''
will decides
as he prepares to face her
( 147 . )
removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding
that will is becoming more adventuresome .
the film shows us many example of will
being afraid to follow jim ,
but never growing curious like his friend .
in the book 
will has both a good 
quiet side and an `` evil 
'' daring side like his jim .
in the movie 
each boy only has one mode of thought ,
which destroys bradbury 's theme of both good
and evil being present in each person.in the book ,
will save jim
because of their friendship 
but 
in the movie 
charle halloway save jim to repay jim 's father .
will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury 's novel
because he does not want his best friend to grow up
without him .
it is the good in will ,
the fact
that he cares about his friend ,
that save jim from the evil curse of the carnival .
on the carousel 
jim `` gestured his other hand free
to trail on the wind ,
the one part of him 
the small 
white 
separate part that still remembered their friendship ''
( 269 . )
this shows
that there was good left inside of jim ,
which has the potential
to still defeat evil .
but when charle halloway save jim in the movie ,
he does it to repay the debt
he owes jim 's father ,
who saved will
when he was a little boy .
by changing the motivation for saving jim ,
the filmmaker have ruined bradbury 's original idea
that it takes good to win against evil.in the end of the movie ,
the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smile and laughter .
when the book ends ,
mr. dark turns himself into a little boy and charle halloway smile and laugh at him so much
that he can not stand it and evaporates .
in bradbury 's world 
evil person feed off fear
and can only be defeated by happiness and love .
his message is that good will always prevail over evil ,
but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly .
`` good to evil seems evil 
''
says charle halloway
as he holds the dying mr. dark .
`` so i will do only good to you 
jed .
i will simply hold you and watch you poison yourself ''
( 275 . )
in the movie 
mr. dark is the only one left on the carousel
when lightning hit it ,
and he dies .
by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smile 
the filmmaker imply
that bad weather is the most effective way
to defeat evil ,
as if lightning only strike those
who are bad .
this takes away the major theme of bradbury 's book ,
which is that doing `` good '' toward other ward off evil.good may always triumph over evil ,
but trying to make movie more kid-friendly will always force filmmaker to leave out some of the theme from the book
they are based on .
in the movie 
`` something wicked this way comes 
''
will does not transform ,
will 's friendship does not save jim ,
and smile and laughter do not defeat the carnival .
as a result 
the filmmaker have left out too many of bradbury 's main point .
the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world
the author has established .
in the case of this story 
bradbury 's frightening world of opposing force of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer 
simpler version of itself .
