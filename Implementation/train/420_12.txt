i loved this film .
i thought
it would be easy to watch 
and easy to forget .
i ran out
after watching this to buy the dvd 
obv not easily forgotten !
the script is illiant ,
and the casting could not be more perfect .
each character has their moment ,
and i laughed hard throughout this film ,
comedic timing was spot-on .
