brilliant film 
the next best film to the drunken master
( jackie chan ) .
i recently bought it on an original vhs and i have not seen this film for 15 year but still as good
as it was back then .
the acting was terrible
and the dubbing was even worse
but it those feature
that make this film
( and many other old fashioned chinese kung-fu movie )
great .
the choreography is awesome
and the storyline is basic .
i have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin
but know
it is the same film
but gordon liu plays san te
but san te in thr return to the 36th chamber is played by a different character .
it has a lot of comedy value and illiant kung-fu .
