i was raised watching the original batman animated series ,
and am an avid batman graphic novel collector .
with a comic book hero as iconic as batman 
there are certain trait
that can not be changed .
creative liberty are all well and good ,
but
when it completely changes the character ,
then it is too far .
i purchased one of the season of `` the batman '' in the hope
that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creator ' reasoning
for making this show such an atrocity .
in an interview on the making of `` the batman 
'' one of the artist or writer
( i am unsure
which )
said
that
`` we felt
we should not mess with batman ,
but we could mess with the villain . ''
so 
they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention 
the penguin into some anime knockoff 
mr. freeze into a super-powered jewel thief 
poison ivy into a teenage hippie 
and countless other shameful act
which are making bob kane roll over in his grave .
to sum it all up :
i wish
i had more hand
so i could give this show four thumb down .
it squeezes by my rating with a 2/10 simply
because it uses the batman name .
warner bro ... rethink this !
please !
