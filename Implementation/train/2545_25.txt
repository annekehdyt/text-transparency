i really liked this movie .
i have read a few of the other comment ,
and although i pity those
who did not understand it ,
i do agree with some of the criticism .
which 
in a strange way 
makes me like this movie all the more .
i accept
that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public ,
yet it has so many level
and is still great to watch .
i also love the movie 
such as this one ,
which provoke so many debate ,
theory ,
possible ending and hidden subtext .
congratulation mr.crowe 
definitely in my top ten.p.s .
saw this
when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico ,
it was late at night
and i had to get back to my hotel
and i had a major paranoia trip !
where does the dream end and the real begin ?
