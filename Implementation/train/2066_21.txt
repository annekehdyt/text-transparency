i do not usually comment ,
but there are thing
that need to be said .
where to start ... the acting ,
on jeremy london 's part was horrible !
i did not think
he could be so bad .
the plot could have been good ,
had it been well directed 
along with a good solid performance from the lead actor .
unfortunately 
this is one of those movie
you read about
and think
it has great potential
to be entertaining ,
but get disappointed from the start .
well 
at least i got good laugh .
i would not waste my time
if i were you .
