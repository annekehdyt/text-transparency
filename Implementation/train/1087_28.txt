as other have said ,
`` no 
luciano '' is a more apt title or response to this movie title .
for entertainment 
the great opera singer should stick to singing ... ..not
that he is a terrible actor .
it is just that this movie stinks.the first 25 minute were fine - a nice family movie ,
as it were -
but after that it is nothing but a boring soap opera.appropriately
playing a singer 
pavarotti ,
as `` giorgio fini 
'' loses his voice a few time and the doctor 
`` pamela taylor ''
( kathryn harrold )
comes to the rescue .
the singer then falls for the doctor ,
the doctor slowly falls for the singer ,
the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.pavarotti has a winning smile
and is a likable guy .
it is harrold that spoils thing and after watching her here i am not surprised
she did not become a star .
there is nice scenery in the movie
to enjoy 
good shot of san francisco and italy 
at least in the first half of the film .
i got bored
and do not remember much about the second half of it .
