disappointing 
predictable film
in which a woman
( mc teer )
travels with her daughter from state to state
because she can not maintain relationship and find happiness .
in this genre 'anywhere but here ' starring susan sarandon and natalie portman gave a much better insight into a mother/daughter relationship .
with better acting as well .
