according to this board ,
i guess either you love it or hate it .
usually how it goes with all movie .
there is no need to get testy with other though .
all we are doing here
is giving opinion .
i rented this movie last night
and i want to come
and throw my opinion in the mix .
i was surprised
by how many person are thrashing it though .
there is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan .
i am a horror movie fan .
most plain ol\u00e9 ' movie fan do not like horror movie .
so many low budget cam corder looking movie are coming out these day .
it is hard to keep up .
and what makes it tough
to stay into these movie
is how bad they are .
i wanted to come
and write a review about `` hood of the living dead ''
because it is pretty damn good
compared to the rest of the junk out there .
it is nothing special
but it is those horror film maker
that try to be too serious
that end up making a horrible horror film .
i really liked this one .
you telling me
there is no effort in this one ?
and one more thing 
i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collection
that you are so proud of 
nothing but major motion picture right ?
nothing wrong with that ,
but you have to know how to appreciate low-budget independent .
i knew
what i was getting
when i watched this movie .
i am not going to be upset
because i thought
it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie .
some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again
and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix .
and if most of you are under 24 ,
that explains everything .
good movie folk 
check it out .
