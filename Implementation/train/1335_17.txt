german think
smirking is funny
( just like american think
mumbling is sexy
and that woman with english accent are acting ) .
i had to cross my eye
whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close-up of a smirking face .
one of those 'housewife hack corporate mainframe ' tale
where she defrauds a bank
by tapping a few random key on her home pc
which is connected only to a power socket .
the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady .
can not say i share his feeling .
there is quite a funny bit
when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the advert .
apparently this review needs to be one line longer
so here it is .
