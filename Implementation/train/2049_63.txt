dana andrew stands `` where the sidewalk ends '' in this 1950 film
that also stars gene tierney 
gary merrill 
karl malden and neville brand .
andrew plays new york city detective sgt .
mark dixon 
a cop with a bad temper
who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspect .
when a man is murdered at a gambling club
owned by a mobster 
scalise
( merrill ) ,
dixon and his partner go to investigate .
scalise blames the murder on ken paine
( steven ) ,
who has now left the club
after fighting not only with his wife 
morgan
( tierney )
but the victim .
dixon thinks
the victim won a lot of money
and was killed
as a result by the mobster 's man .
he goes to see paine and 
not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war 
knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him .
now he must cover up the murder .
as a further complication 
he falls for morgan ;
her father
( ken tully ) ,
who went to paine 's apartmant
after he saw
that paine had hit his daughter ,
is arrested for the crime.this is a really terrific 
gritty noir with some good performance .
the ruggedly handome and weathered andrew is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective
who has to stay one step ahead of his colleague .
the movie reunites him with his fabulous `` laura '' costar 
gene tierney ,
and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in man
who apparently is used to being roughed up .
little does she know ,
she is got another one on her hand .
ken tully does a terrific job as her father ,
who protests his innocence
despite some damning evidence .
karl malden is very tough
as dixon 's boss.my only problem with this well-directed ,
fast-moving and absorbing film is the ending .
pure hollywood and ,
putting myself in tierney 's place ,
i doubt
i would react the same way .
a minor criticism for a film
written by ben hecht
and directed by otto preminger .
i did not find it as awe-inspiring as `` laura 
''
but few thing in this world are .
if you like film noir ,
this is a must-see .
