flat character
that you do not and
never will care about .
cringe-inducing dialogue at place .
no twist
( they think
they have one ,
but if you did not figure it out after about 40mins you are not too ight ) .
lot of well know actor in role and performance
that 
fortunately for everyone involved 
will be forgotten
as soon as the end credit roll.i do not mind 'slow ' movie ,
but they have got to be going _somewhere_ .
this one does not.the plot was not what made this a direct-to-dvd movie ,
that is just a rather convenient excuse
to try
and drum up some fake controversy.the as-of-writing 37
( ! )
ten
( 10 )
rating must be from person
involved with the production .
