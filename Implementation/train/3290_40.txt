i thought
that mukhsin has been wonderfully written .
its not just about entertainment .
there is tonne of subtle message
that
i think
yasmin was trying to ing across .
and yes 
it might be confusing to some of you
( especially if you did not watch sepet and/or gua for 76 time )
.i bet u noticed
how they use character from the two movie before right ?
its really ironic how the character relate .
like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gua .
and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future .
and i absolutely love the voice-over .
its crude yet awakeningly fresh .
like ,
when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard ,
then there was suddenly mukhsin 's voice
saying 'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim.. '
( the scene
when he climbed the tree )
.it captured malaysian 's attitude
( and in some mild way ,
sniggering at how pathetic it is )
portrayed in the character .
for example 
even the kid can be really sharp tongued
( complete with the shrill annoying voice )
and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long .
and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl ,
when ur own life is not sorted out .
all i can say is ,
this movie totally reached my expectation
if not exceeded it .
it kept me glued to the screen ,
i could not even take my eye off it .
not even to make out in the cinema .
ha ha .
