want a great recipe for failure ?
take a s****y plot ,
add in some weak ,
completely undeveloped character and than throw in the worst special effect
a horror movie has known .
let stew for a week
( the amount of time probably spent making this trash ) .
the result is corpse grinder 
a movie
that takes bad movie to dangerous and exotically low places.the movie
utterly blew .
my word can not convey how painful it was to watch .
this is not one of those bad movie
that you and your friend can sit around
and make fun of .
this is not plan 9 from outer space .
this is a long 
boring 
sad waste of time .
corpse grinder ii is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen .
i depress me
when i realize
that person actually took time out of their life to act in this shit ,
if you can call it acting .
but than again ,
when you have poor direction ,
poor storywriting 
poor everything ,
acting is the last thing to criticize.this movie is like a huge 
disgusting turd
that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence 
fearful
that a friend or loved one might somehow see it .
i really with i could somehow destroy every copy of this film ,
so it will not pollute the mind of aspiring filmmaker .
thank you 
ted v. mikel ,
for giving me new found respect for every movie i
have ever seen .
you have shown me what is truly awful ,
and why i should appreciate all those movie
that are merely crappy or boring .
