many mystery story follow the standard whodunit path :
murder most foul 
gathering of clue 
gaggle of possible perps 
sprinkling of red herring 
and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver .
`` forgotten '' abandon the well-trod
and gives us complex character
who may or may not have committed terrible act .
the fact
that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answer
and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some ,
but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale
which probe 
disturbs 
and haunt with the question :
what does an evil person look like ? excellent acting and production combine
to make a mystery
not easily ... forgotten .
