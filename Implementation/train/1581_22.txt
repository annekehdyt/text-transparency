kurosawa weaves a tale
that has a cast of character as diverse as any shakespearean drama ,
and the acting is true to the story ,
with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale .
it is touching 
funny and intriguing in all part .
the character development is near perfect ,
the cinematography is vivid and engaging ,
and the story draws
you in.i would like to say
that the `` samurai freak '' and those
obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tale of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa 's best work .
perhaps not his best ,
but even at his worst 
kurosawa is better than many of the best .
this story is so based in elevating the mundane life of ordinary person in a time of great change ,
that it is timeless ,
despite being set in the not-so-distant past.i
would heartily recommend this to any movie buff ,
and especially to those
who are likely to continue on to read the novel
on which the film is based .
