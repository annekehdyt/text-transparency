this is a totally delightful and unexpected film .
you start by following a young person
who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran .
if iran win
they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany .
the problem is the young person is a girl and girl
( or woman for that matter ) are not allowed into football match to `` sit with man '' .
what follows is a wonderful comedy ,
played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast .
the film explores the absurdity of restriction on the freedom of woman
( and for that matter the young soldier who have to corral them ) .
there are some excellent set piece ,
not least when one of the girl must go to the toilet and 
of course ,
the stadium has no toilet for woman .
the camera work is of the simplest and in some way
this story could have been told as a stage play .
yet it is the small scale
that gives the film its bite .
great cinema ?
no 
probably not ; great entertainmant - for sure .
