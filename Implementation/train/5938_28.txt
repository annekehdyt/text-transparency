i was worried
that my daughter might get the wrong idea .
i think
the `` dark-heart '' character is a little on the rough side and i do not like the way
he shape-shifts into a `` mean '' frog 
fox ,
boy i was wrong ,
this movie was made for my kid 
not for me .
she `` gets it ''
when it went over
( under ? )
my head .
of course i do not `` get it '' .
this is not one of the new kid movie
that adult will also enjoy .
this is straight for the young one ,
and the crew knew
what they were doing .
there is not any political junk ether .
there is no magic key
that will save the world from ourself ,
nobody has the right
to access excess ,
and everyone is not happy all the time .
and as a side benefit 
nobody dies !
