i saw this movie
when it was released ,
and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these year .
here is why :
greenaway 's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest
and make it literal .
if a character were to say ,
`` my heart takes flight 
''
we 'd be shown an actual human heart 
with pigeon wing attached 
flapping across the screen .
this process makes for some lush tableaux ,
but ultimately it is a facile exercise .
and it becomes deadly boring.i do not begrudge the pleasure other viewer
found in this movie ,
but it is worth knowing
that not everyone in the audience was enraptured .
