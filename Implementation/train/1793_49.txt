this is what i was expecting
when star trek ds9 premiered .
not to slight ds9 .
that was a wonderful show
in it is own right ,
however it never really gave the fan more of what they wanted .
enterprise is that show .
while having a similarity to the original trek
it differs enough to be original
in it is own way .
it makes the idea of exploration
exciting to us again .
and that was one of the primary ingredient
that made the original so loved .
another ingredient to success was the relationship
that evolved between the crew member .
viewer really cared deeply for the crew .
enterprise has much promise in this area as well .
the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising .
while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch ,
i feel
the tension on enterprise can lead to much more
and say
alot more than is typical .
i think
when we deal with such grand scale character of different race or species even ,
we get some very interesting idea and television .
also ,
we should note the performance ,
blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol
and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character
that delivers a great performance .
the rest of the cast delivered good performance also .
my only gripe are as follows .
the theme .
it is good it is different 
but a little to light hearted for my liking .
we need something a little more grand .
does not have to be orchestral .
maybe something with a little more electronic sound
would suffice .
and my one other complaint .
they sell too many adds .
they could fix this
by selling less ad ,
or making all show two parter .
otherwise we will end up
seeing the show final act getting wrapped up way too quickly
as was one of my complaint of voyager .
