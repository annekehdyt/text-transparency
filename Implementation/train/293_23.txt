the first 50 minute of this movie were quite boring .
it focused on the personal problem doyle had ,
including his sick wife 
death threat by fan 
a pushy publisher and feeling of guilt
concerning his mentally ill father .
even though these subject had an important impact on doyle 's life ,
i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holme .
the last 40 minute were excellent .
we finally got a look inside doyle head ,
how he created holme
and why he had to 'kill ' holme .
the actor are excellent .
including the intriguing selden
played by tim mcinnerny 
arthur conan doyle 
a compelling role
played by dougla henshall and brian cox as the 'role model ' for sherlock holme 
dr. bell .
the location are good ,
especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice .
if the first 50 minute were as good the the last 40 minute this
would have been a small masterpiece .
