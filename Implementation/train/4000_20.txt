or at least one of the best .
i think
this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64 .
bowser is up to his usual shenanigan
( yeah it is a dumb word
but the only one i can think of )
and mario must stop him again .
this game is very fun to play ,
and contains lot of nostalgia to me .
the only bad thing
about it is the graphic ,
which are awful to today 's standard ,
but everything else is pretty good
( especially the little mini-game you can unlock )
it is the second best n64 game
( the first best is conker 's bad fur day )
that i recommend to any mario fan 
or any fan of platform game .
it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day.9/10 or :
