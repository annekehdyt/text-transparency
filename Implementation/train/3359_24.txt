in hollywood in the 1930 's and 1940 's 
i think
that every studio can make a western 
except warner os .
the few time they try ,
it always ridiculous
( except 
perhaps ,
for they died with their boot on -
which is a cavalery western . )
i have read
that humphrey bogart 
seing jame cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head ,
said
that he looks like a mushroom .
true !
cagney and bogart are too urban ,
too xxe century to be credible in a western movie .
the story here had no suprise ,
and it did't help .
every 10 minute 
i figure i can see bogart and cagney drop their little gun
and put hand in a machine gun
to get away from the set in a 1930 's black car .
