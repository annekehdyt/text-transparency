i went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb .
with such a low expectation 
any form of entertainmant would be a pleasant surprise .
the soundtrack was the best part of the movie ,
but poking fun at the nonsense
that goes on in single ward
was also amusing.this said ,
there were many thing about the single ward
that were completely annoying .
the entire film was poorly dubbed
and made watching mouth
while listening to their voice very irritating .
this lack of professionalism was surpassed only by the cameos of mormon celeity
who have no business acting.this film
will do well among mormondom 
especially in college community
where single ward exist .
however the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor loser
who find themselves unmarried .
( only the pretty girl in the single ward get married 
the fat 
ugly one do not ,
but all the ugly man do )
ultimately we realize
that the whole film was an advertisemant for ldssingle.com
