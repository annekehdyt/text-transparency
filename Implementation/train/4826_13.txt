i was extremely suspicious of the idea
presented in this movie ,
but being relatively ignorant of quantum physic aside from what i recalled from the excellent `` short history of nearly everything ''
and what i was able to choke down in `` a brief history of time 
''
it sounded interesting at time .
however 
the obvious nonsense of the story of the indian being unable to see the ship of the explorer was ridiculous .
i really started questioning
what was being shoveler at that point ,
but then the clincher was the revelation
that one of the speaker was actually `` channelling '' some loony
named `` ramtha '' completely upset the applecart for me.what a waste of two hour .
