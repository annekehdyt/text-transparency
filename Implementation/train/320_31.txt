a few year back the same person
who created paris 
j'taime. ,
which was imperfect but very enjoyable
( my rating was a 7 ) ,
created this piece of garbage about new york city.in paris ,
i love you
( j'taime )
created a feeling for paris
and it was made in many part of beautiful paris.in this current film ,
i did not recognize new york city ,
i did not feel
that i was in the city of my birth.new york does have 5 borough ,
i saw no scene in the bronx 
or queen ,
there is one scene in brooklyn ,
( brighton beach ) ,
i saw no scene in time square or greenwich village/ no scene of the beautiful hotel or theatre .
it does have a large cast ,
most of the performer were not even stereotype ,
they were caricature of the lowest sort.the very few humorous moment are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorker
that we all know
and love.. a few of the film nominated for the 'razzie ' award were far better.rating : *
( out of 4 )
20 point
( out of 100 )
imdb 1
( out of 10 )
in my way of thinking i think
the title should have beennew york ,
i hate you .
