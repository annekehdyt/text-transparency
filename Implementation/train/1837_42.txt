i run a group
to stop comedian exploitation and i
just spent the past 2 month hearing horror story from comedian
who attempted to audition for ,
`` last comic standing . ''
if they do not have a good agent ,
then they do not even get a chance
to audition so more than 80 % of the comedian
who turn up are rejected
before they can show anyone
that they have talent !
if they do make it to an audition ,
i was told
that it is `` pre-determined ''
if they get a second chance .
so what the tv audience see is not the best comic in the us.if the comic do make it to the show ,
then most of them do not get imdb credit .
i know this
because i did the credit for all 6 season of ,
`` last comic standing ''
and i do not get paid
for doing the producer ' job .
it is really a disgrace .
a month ago 
i asked 
`` last comic standing 7 '' on facebook
why the producer are not giving imdb credit
and i was banned from their facebook page ! ! !
i am not a comedian
so i do not have a personal stake in this .
i just want person to know the truth .
i do not like seeing anyone getting exploited
and that is why i have been helping the comedian .
comedian get exploited on hbo 
bet 
tvone and other cable network
but nbc is a big three network
so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves
for allowing this exploitation to happen.please watch this video of a comedian
who was victimized :
