if `` the cabinet of dr. caligari '' is the father of all horror film
( and of german expressionist cinema ) ,
this pre-wwi film is the grandfather .
the titular student ,
starving in an empty garret ,
makes a deal with the devil
-- the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold 
in exchange for `` anything in this room . ''
the devil chooses the student 's reflection in his mirror .
he walks off with the student 's doppelganger ,
who commits crime
for which the student is blamed.the film is marred by some limitation
arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking ;
the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effect ,
but the film is 
of necessity 
virtually all shot in shadowless daylight .
but the scene
where the reflection walks out of the mirror
still packs a wallop.more interesting for the trend
it fortells than for its own sake ,
the student of prague is still worthwhile .
