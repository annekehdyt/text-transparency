i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom day of the '60s ,
i was doing several interview and bio of obscure actors/actress 
most notably ben 
actress fay spain 
and jody fair ,
who played angela in 1961 's the young savage .
ben was one of the person at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago 
about 1970 ,
when i had a nice chat with him and his `` career '' and life .
all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day .
wish i still had copy of those interview ,
but time march on 
and any of those person surely would not ' remember me at all so many year later .
ben was a really nice fellow 
ekeing out a living
( the con of those day did not even pay their guest 
unless 
of course they were big-name star ,
and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollar 
at most !
good to know ben 's still alive and kicking !
how 'bout a remake of creature 
but 50 year older !
ugly then 
uglier now !
