there was not a day in 2002
where i was not chased by a scarecrow i felt
that this film handled a serious issue wellit
ought back a lot of memory
as it was so realisticeven today i have nightmare about corn on the cob 
and can not even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my lifei have to admit though 
at one point in the film i did have to turn it off
as it hit too close to homefor those of you
who have never been attacked by a scarecrow ,
by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victim this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn ,
believe me ,
i have been there
and i have the scar watch the film 
its amazing and educational
