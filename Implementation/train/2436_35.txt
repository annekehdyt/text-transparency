where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better
known film
directed by otto preminger 
the man
who gave the world laura .
and this time 
he is got the same co-star :
dana andrew and gene tierney .
it must be said
that tierney here is under-used in what amount to more of a supporting role
while the spotlight goes to andrew.he play a tough ,
hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thug in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him .
when suspicion falls on a cab driver
( tom tully ) ,
he goes along with the investigation into the murder
but starts to feel guilt
because he is in love with the cabbie 's daughter
( gene tierney ) .
tierney 
by the way 
looks a little too elegant for the girl
she is playing here
and does not seem to fit into the squalid background element of the story.the story takes a grim turn
as the investigation goes deeper
and it is discovered
that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero .
by the end 
it turns into a morality tale with andrew
developing a conscience over his crime.it
is fascinating as film noir with capable performance from a strong supporting cast .
a good entry in the field of noir 
forcefully
directed by preminger
and nicely played by andrew and tierney ,
despite the slight miscasting of her character .
