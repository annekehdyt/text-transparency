i have seen this movie
when i was about 7 year old -
which was 33 year ago -
and i never forgot this movie !
i was deeply touched
and moved by the ave little boy and the beautiful eagle .
and i just could not believe
it
when he turned into an eagle just
when everyone in the theater thought
he was going to die ... my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if
she remembered the movie
we saw with the boy and the eagle
and she said
she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday .
so it is not just me.this movie is a must see ! !
! you will never forget
it - just like my sister and me ...
