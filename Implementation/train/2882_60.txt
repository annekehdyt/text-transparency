what do you get
when you mix a lump of clich\u00e9s with a directionless pacing and a group of character
who you do not care about and a failed attempt
at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clich\u00e9s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget ?
why 
you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movie ever made !
i am referring 
of course 
to domino.here are some thing
that person might say during the viewing of this movie : ''
ooh 
wow 
the storyline is told out of sequence ,
that has not been done a billion time before .
and much more skillfully than in this movie .
`` `` wow 
look at all of the flashing light and grainy film texture and elaborate transition !
the director is trying so hard to make thing look arty
and to establish a visual style !
it is just too bad
that none of these effect add anything to the movie or make sense with the scene
they are in ,
and it is also too bad that most of them come across as irritating !
`` `` i have heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movie before !
`` `` i have seen this scene in about thirty thousand movie
before !
`` `` this one too !
`` `` uh 
did not they reveal this 'plot twist ' about half an hour ago ?
was that supposed to be surprising ?
`` `` if this movie is supposed to be showing a 'tough chick ' going around kicking ass ...
when why does not she do very much of it ?
`` `` i can not believe
how unoriginal this dialogue is .
`` `` how long is this thing ?
i feel
like i have been watching it for over four hour already .
`` `` i have no idea what just happened ,
but also 
i do not particularly feel
motivated to try to figure it out .
`` `` is this over yet ?
`` `` i want my money back .
`` `` the song in this soundtrack feel so misused here .
`` `` it is ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detract from the impact of each one . `` `` ugh .
`` and 
finally :
`` i might have to end my friendship with the person
who recommended this movie to me .
`` in summation 
this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect .
avoid watching it at all cost .
if your house is on fire
and this movie is playing in the only room
that is not flammable ,
you should seriously consider being burned alive instead .
( if i sound bitter ,
it is because i just spent over two hour watching this movie and 
uh ,
i did not enjoy it very much . )
