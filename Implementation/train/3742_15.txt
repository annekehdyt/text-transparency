not a bad martial art film .
fight scene were good .
michel qissi did a good job
directing his first film
without van damme .
story worked
without foul language
and too much blood .
screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story
that works .
it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre .
she likes the art
and having strong woman promenant .
it was definitely worth watching .
i recommend the film to all drama and martial art lover .
