in my mind 
this remains one of the very best depiction of superman on tv 
as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comic period.this series paid homage to both the superman film of the '70s/'80 and the superman comic series `` reboot '' of 1986-onward
( `` man of steel 
'' `` superman vol 2 
'' `` action comic 
'' `` adventure of superman 
'' etc ) .
the opening score and title were stirring ,
based on the john william score from the film ,
updated for a saturday morning action series .
marv wolfman 
one of the main contributor to the comic reboot
( writer of `` adventure of superman '' )
was a perfect choice
to be involved in this animated series .
overall 
the series had a more mature feel
while continuing to be very kid-friendly.superman was presented as believable 
strong 
and iconic .
his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac/ceo incarnation .
the daily planet character lois 
jimmy 
and perry were portrayed well .
one of my favorite appearance was by wonder woman ,
and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira
( `` paradise island '' ) .
both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era ,
and it seemed like an equally well-done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.the one thing
that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd/blu-ray !
it deserves to be .
