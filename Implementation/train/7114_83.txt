i watched scarecrow
because of the buzz surrounding it .
well 
i can not imagine anyone liking this movie
because it is just bad 
bad ,
bad.it is obvious
that whoever made this movie
does not know a single thing about horror .
the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genre :
action movie
( gun and criminal )
and horror
( living scarecrow ) .
when the criminal are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrow ,
the two genre automatically cancel each other out
because 
first 
they are criminal
and who cares about criminal ,
and second ,
because they are stupid criminal to boot !
having zombie scarecrow go
after them just does not work here .
where is the horror in that ?
i wanted the criminal to die horrible ,
painful deaths.but the story is so badly constructed
that this marriage of genre ,
which could have been original
if handle well 
never gel .
we are simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminal and a bunch of scarecrow ,
which are `` alive '' for whatever flimsy reason
the filmmaker thought up .
making thing even worse is the fact
that the cinematography is terrible
( tv like )
and 
worse offense of all 
whole bunch of the dialogue are told on cbs ,
and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected image
as if we are watching some sort of radio show .
this part was really bad .
the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea !
i can not tell you how annoying that was.as i have already mentioned ,
the criminal in scarecrow are amazingly stupid .
for instance ,
when someone suddenly shows up ,
gutted and filled with money and straw
( yep 
straw )
in his huge open wound 
the other ask `` what drug is he on ? ''
after they shoot ton of bullet in him ,
unable to kill him
( he is been `` zombiefied '' by the scarecrow .
do not ask ... ) .
get a freaking clue 
moron .
i have never seen such stupid person in a movie .
and then there is the girl .
i wished one of the scarecrow had killed her quickly
because she was a pain in the butt .
when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow `` cross '' ,
she actually blames the criminal in an embarrassing scene
( bad acting ) ,
even though the criminal could not have done it .
what a dimwit she was !
but the scarecrow are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick .
they are not scary .
nothing much is explained about them .
they are just a plot device in this plot device
filled movie.mr wesley ,
filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 second nonstop does not elicit anything but sheer boredom .
and that scene with the talking head in the fridge .
thank for the laughter.all in all 
this had to be one of the worst movie i
have seen recently
( and i have seen a lot of movie these day ! )
between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrow 
i would rather watcher silo killer again .
yep 
scarecrow is that bad .
