i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movie on the market ,
and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith
that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor .
i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static-induced headache increased .
i found white noise
to be preposterous beyond our best effort of suspension of disbelief .
even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal
sustained by michael keaton ,
i was totally unaffected by his demise .
up until the credit i diligently awaited for something
-- anything --
of substance to connect me to the character ' story ,
but such relief never came .
sure 
there were the occasional heart-stopper moment ,
but
only because loud noise tend to do that to the dozing viewer.while the acting was lame ,
michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date .
perhaps the only redeeming quality
that white noise has to offer
is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton 's abode .
overall 
white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea
that those
who die
are trapped in a world
guarded by three malicious shadow ,
contriving to trick the living
into following the dead to their own grave .
