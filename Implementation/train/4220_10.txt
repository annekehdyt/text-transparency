first of all 
jon bon jovi does not seem to be in place in a vampire movie .
together with the other not so interesting character
and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable .
if you keep
that in mind and you are a total vampire movie fan ,
you can have some fun with a few of the scene .
do not expect any tarantino-style chapter here
and neither an anne rice storyline .
( i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ; )
