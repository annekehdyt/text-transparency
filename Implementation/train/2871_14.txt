i bought bloodsucker on ebay a while ago .
i watched part and deemed
it just too dumb to review again .
the excessive amount of watery 'blood ' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the `` whip-around '' wind sounds .
my friend and i made a super low budget movie ,
and the effect still exceeded this crap fest.as for the amount of mistake in this movie ,
there are way too many to count .
i knew one of the actor -
believe it or not ,
he was my theatre teacher .
ha !
final verdict : do not bother with this `` horror '' flick .
3 star
( out of a possible 73 )
