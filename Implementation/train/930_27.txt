this is just about in the same league as `the black cat ' ,
although i would give this a 9 rather than a 9+ .
that is praise indeed for a film
that has been so badly underrated
that it is amazing ! `the invisible ray ' is part horror 
part drama and certainly part sci-fi .
for a movie
made in 1936 the sci-fi element were a good deal ahead of their time .
the mixture of horror 
drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend ,
while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff could not be better.director lambert hillyer captures a lot of element
that james whale did so often .
what i am saying
is that this film is eerie and well shot .
the scene with the gargoyle outside of lugosi 's room is a perfect example of the mood .
it is a standout moment in the film ,
which is so sadly missing in today 's movie of the genre.as with `the black cat ' and `island of lost soul ' ,
i can not understand
why this film has yet to be released on dvd .
when you consider some of the junk
that is already been transferred to dvd it
is that much more puzzling.anyway 
watch this film
if you get the chance .
when it is released on dvd grab it fast
and put it in an honored spot
within your dvd liary .
