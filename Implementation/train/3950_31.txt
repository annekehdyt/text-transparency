so ,
being a fairly deep fan of horror movie ,
it is been a while
since i have seen one
that really made me jump
( or fidget nervously .
) definitely going to get this on dvd
when it comes out ... a hell of a lot better than the ring .
the thing
that i do not get
is that so many person
that we talkd with after the movie
thought
that it was horrible 
well ,
if that is what you think ,
then so be it ... i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared ,
so i have to say
that this one is worth watching.now ,
you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line ,
because the plot goes back an forth a little bit
to help build the story
( i think
that
if it was shown in chronological order ,
it would have ruined the whole thing .
) i am actually glad
that this movie had very little bloody messes in it ...
maybe the rest of you studio writer and whathaveyous will realize
that you do not have to splash the red stuff all over the set
to make person afraid .
