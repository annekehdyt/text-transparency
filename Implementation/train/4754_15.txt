it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb review of this film
than went into the source.here
is a review
without pretension :
just
when you think
nothing is going to happen ,
it does not.dress it up any way you like ,
this is a dull film 
full of unengaging character
doing very little of interest.one
to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick
that you are like 
so deep ,
man.not something to watch for your own pleasure though.unless.you are.pretentious .
