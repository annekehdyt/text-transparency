this movie remind me of `` irr\u00e9versible
( 2002 ) '' ,
another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature .
i did not like the movie
but i can not say
that it is a bad movie ,
it is just special .
i remind me also of `` camping cosmos
( 1996 ) ''
where a bunch of low-class figure are resident of a camp at the sea in belgium .
the same description of person living together ,
side by side against their will and with all the confrontation of character
that do not match together .
i also thought about the book by the french writer emile zola
who was a writer of the style
that is naturalism .
i did not like the movie and i also do not like the person
who are in it .
they all seem so vulgar ,
without any basic good taste .
one could ask the question
why do they live ,
they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce ,
forced to live against their will .
or you could say :
the hell is on this world .
