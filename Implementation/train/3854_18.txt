this is a strange 
cereal 
surreal 
esoteric film .
if there is such a thing as `` intellectual horror '' cinema ,
this film is it .
i started to get scared
and wish
there was someone else watching it with me ,
and it barely has a plot !
i am going to have to see this film again multiple time
before i feel
i really understand it .
if you are the kind of person
who likes `` my dinner with andre '' and film by godard ,
or if you do a lot of mind-altering drug ,
you will probably enjoy this film .
wow .
