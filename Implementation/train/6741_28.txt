i generally find loretta young hard to take ,
too concerned with her look and too ladylike in all the wrong way .
but in this lyrical frank borzage romance ,
and even though she is playing a low-self-esteem patsy
who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy ,
she is direct and honest and irresistible .
it is an odd little movie ,
played mostly in a one-room shack in a hooverville ,
unusually up-front about the depression yet romantic and idealized .
tracy ,
playing a blustery 
hard-to-take `` regular guy ''
who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today 's standard 
softens his character 's hard edge
and almost makes him appealing .
there is good
supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell
( who never got as far
as she should have ) ,
and jo swerling 's screenplay is modest and efficient .
but the real hero are borzage ,
who alway liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up 
and young .
you sort of want to slap her
and tell her character to wise up ,
she is too good for this guy ,
but she is so dewy and persuasive ,
you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion .
