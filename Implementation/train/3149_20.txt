i loves this movie ,
because it showed
that they were not killing for fun but to save the one they loved !
heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe .
it has a few quick inappropriate scene
but is all right other than that .
the language is very mild and sometime do not even know it is there .
this movie shows
that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killer !
i hope
that person will watch this movie
and learn about important time in history like this one .
there is one thing
that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned
looked at !
also that that is how person remember them 
from their armor .
i hope
that person will watch this movie
and get interested as i have .
