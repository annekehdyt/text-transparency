man in black 2 was a real disappointmant for me .
while the actor did a pretty good job 
especially smith ,
there just is not a cure for a poor script once in production .
the movie really had a `` sequel '' kind of feel ,
playing off partial event of the first film .
the story was 
in a word ... bad 
at best .
it was not thought out well ,
and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times.in the first flick ,
the mib organization had a kind of `` elite '' force feel .
you had a few special agent ,
and it had a `` clandestine '' kind of feel
to it .
in the sequel 
the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe.the movie was not terrible or anything..
it just lacked the `` coolness ''
( for lack of a better phrase )
of the first movie .
a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second ,
and did not really add any originality to the mib universe.a perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 film .
was it decent ?
yeah .
is it worthy of bearing
it is title ?
not really .
