the marquis de sade 
egypt 
ancient gnostic cult 
robert englund in a dual role 
gratuitous sex and nudity 
murder and mayhem ... on paper tobe hopper 's night terror sounds like it should be at least a fun 
entertaining flick
given the ingredient .
it is not .
it is a plot less 
incoherent shamble
that ings little entertainment .
there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult
that follows the work of de sade
who for some unclear reason
feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian archaeologist and kill her .
that is pretty much it- i think
it has something to with the gnostic but
who knows
what the writer were thinking .
most of the movie is a meandering mess
as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness 
dream sequence and erotic encounter 
intercut with scene of englund as the imprisoned de sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery .
it seems like the maker were trying for something serious
but whatever their pretension were they are buried in the cheesiness 
bad acting 
sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.there are not too many good point .
robert englund is fun to watch ,
as always and the lead actress 
zoe trilling 
whilst not very talented 
is attractive and in various stage of undress through the movie
but watching night terror is a chore .
at least i got to see the movie from which the `` when you are as criminal as i '' bit from the australian film certification rating guide
that was on the front of so many vhs tape from the ninety came from .
