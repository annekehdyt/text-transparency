this movie is one of the funniest 
saddest and most accurate portrayal of the mentality
that seems to have pervaded the balkan yet again ,
45 year after the time depicted .
all the usual character and conflict are presented with such anger 
sadness and love combined
that it is impossible to decide
whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response .
the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the type 
however 
make it for a great film
to watch
if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-yugoslavia to its madness .
in fact 
no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything
until they saw this movie 
and its twin 
*maratonci trce pocasni krug .
* did i mention
it is one of the funniest movie i have ever seen ?
