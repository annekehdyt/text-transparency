the romance of the movie ,
which is also its main theme ,
is good and nicely presented .
however 
the surrounding of the love story is too lyric 
graphical and unrealistic .
even worse 
the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible ,
exactly like the end of the movie .
do not hesitate to watch this movie ,
if it attracted your interest ,
but do not expect too much of it either .
