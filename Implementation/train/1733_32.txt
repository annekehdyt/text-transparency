this was 
undoubtedly 
the most disturbing movie
that i have ever seen .
the first part of the movie 
though strange 
has a light and amusing quality to it .
the journey begins on such a peaceful note 
detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hill of appalachia .
but that is misleading beyond belief .
the obvious social problem
( ineeding )
and the deformity of the countryside 's inhabitant are only the first disturbing aspect of the movie .
i can still hear bobby moaning in pain 
and i shudder at the thought .
lewis 's leg made me wince .
yet ,
while the movie was 
on the whole 
very disturbing and distressing ,
it posed some interesting question .
when is it moral 
or right
to take another individual 's life ?
what can morality drive us to do ,
or not do 
in some case ?
and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself ?
whatever conclusion one may draw from the film ,
it is an achievement in its own right
( despite certain aspect
that were chillingly real and gruesome ) .
