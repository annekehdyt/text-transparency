scary movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard
to put it in word .
it makes movie like malibu 's most wanted look like oscar material ,
lets just say
that.the original scary movie was great fun 
one of the better 90s spoof movie ,
coming from a great team
who previously rocked our world with do not be a menace to south central whilst
drinking your juice in the hood .
but what the hell happened ? !
after the tragedy
that was scary movie 2 ,
i thought
the cast and crew change would help matter ,
but its even worse.within 20mins i would smiled twice .
not one laugh 
the joke were recycled and originality was obviously no factor .
the fact
that at this point in writing 
the majority of person on this site have voted
it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill.
when there is great flick like school of rock out ,
which actually have joke
that are *gasp* funny ,
anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined.no stars/****
