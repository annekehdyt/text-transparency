my name is heather and i am the girl
whose story this movie was based on .
i want to thank all of you
who saw this movie
and enjoyed it .
as crude and harsh as some of the thing
that were depicted in this movie were ,
it did not really even come close to describing how bad thing actually were .
not to mention the affect
everything had on my mother and little sister .
thank once again for the great comment
that everyone had ,
i truly appreciate themhi everyone !
this is heather 's mom .
it is hard to believe
that so many year have gone by since this movie
was made .
harder even to believe that person were still watching it a year ago .
for any of you out there
who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation ,
please know
that there are person out here in cyberspace
that do understand completely how you feel .
our thought and prayer are with each and every one of you .
