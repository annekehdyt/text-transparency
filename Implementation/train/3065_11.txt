i happened upon this film by accident ,
and really enjoyed .
timothy busfield 's character is without redeeming quality 
and at one point 
busfield and star meloni ogle woman
as they pass by ... meloni 's take on the parade is different from busfield 's .
janel maloney is terrific ...
she looks very much like tea leone ,
but the major difference here is that janel can actually act .
some very nice thing in this film and well worth your attention
when it is on cable .
