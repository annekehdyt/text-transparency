there is a certain allure
i have always found in discovering the great
( semi- )
unknown film .
these discovery have nearly always been dramatic film - in my experience 
unknown sci-fi 
action and horror are unknown for very 
very good reason .
i found `` high tide '' on video at a junk store ,
mixed in amongst countless dozen of tape of varying quality .
of course ,
that is the only place i would find it ,
as it is still not on dvd.while i was watching judy davis
( as lillie )
throughout the course of this film ,
i was somehow certain i was watching a great undiscovered performance .
yes 
i had previously seen davis in several small part - and one starring role in `` a passage to india '' .
but ,
although she was superb in the aforementioned film ,
`` high tide '' is a different animal entirely .
since recently watching gillian armstrong 's later film ,
`` charlotte gray '' 
i was acutely aware of the sort of actress
which impresses her .
davis draw much more than a passing resemblance to cate blanchett
- in both manner and sensibility.judy davis ' performance is stunning ,
i can not say enough good thing about it .
she share an amazing on-screen relationship with young claudia karvan
( as ally ) ,
this film 's other great actress .
there is a lot of drama and quiet humanity
they share together ,
the detail of which i will not presume to reveal here
( see it for yourself ! ) .
there is too much good in `` high tide ''
to cover in one review .
indeed 
i would hardly care
to - the film speaks well enough for itself .
in conclusion 
i would like to praise screenwriter laura jone for her stunning dialogue 
director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actor 
and the great russell boyd for his illiant 
understated cinematography
( please see his work in `` tender mercy '' ) .
