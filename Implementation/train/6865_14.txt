this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value .
it gets quite hysterically funny at time ,
but
if you have not spent any time on 'that ' side of the track
you will miss the comedy
when it erupts.the cast of character meld well together
and are quite believable in their role .
how grace handles meeting her dead husband girlfriend was well played .
she is a true lady .
and 
my favorite is grace 's white pimp suit
that she wears.i highly recommend this flick to anyone
who wants to laugh out loud ,
who cheers for the underdog or just wish to watch something different .
