this charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful `` the legend of boggy creek '' is a follow-up in name only .
story abound in a sleepy 
self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious bigfoot creature
called `` big bay ty ''
that resides deep in the uninviting swampland of boggy creek .
two atty other and their older 
more sensible tomboy sister
( a sweetly feisty performance by cute 
pigtailed future `` different stroke '' sitcom star dana plato )
go venturing into the treacherous marsh
to check out
if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being .
the trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry 
bear-like 
humongous 
but very gentle and benevolent sasquatch comes to the kid ' rescue.tom moore 's casual 
no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace 
astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail ,
drawing the assorted country character with great warmth and affection ,
and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic 
restrained 
unforced manner
that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush .
the adorable dawn well
( mary ann on `` gilligan 's island '' )
gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kid ' loving working class single mom
while jim wilson and john hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol ' hayseed curmudgeonly coot .
robert bethard 's capable 
sunny cinematography displays the woodsy
setting in all its sumptuously tranquil 
achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor .
darrell deck 's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudder and jubilant banjo-pluckin ' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic ew .
in addition 
this picture warrant special praise for the way
it uncannily predicts the 90 's kiddie feature bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd year in advance .
