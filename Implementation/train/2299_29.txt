this is the only movie i have ever seen
that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site ,
and that is a significan not statement from someone
who likes `` the attack of the monolith monster . ''
this movie is perfect for anyone
who wants an inoffensive movie .
it is devoid of sex and violence 
for example .
i believe
that this movie is safe for child of all age .
this movie is perfect for anyone
who does not want to be entertained 
challenged 
or stimulated in any way .
adult could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the tv
while the kid watch this movie .
do not be surprise 
however ,
if you wakeup to find the kid
have turned the tv off
and started a board game .
as an adult who enjoys being entertained ,
who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism 
drama 
comedy 
and action 
all of those adult thing
that reflect real life on earth and/or stimulate the imagination ,
this movie has nothing to offer .
