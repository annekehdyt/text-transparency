it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot ,
the character in the show were great as well ,
and complimented one another well .
i was sorry
to see it cut off.. i would have loved to see
where it could have went.you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff
who had more secret than anyone .
lucas was frightening and alluring .
and i would have liked to have seen more of him
and how his character became .
i will however buy
the show
just to enjoy ,
it was great to something different on tv .
and paige turrco
who was caleb 's cousin ,
she was a big mystery as to where
and what she meant to lucas .
its a shame
it is not around still.. or was
never finished ,
i would have loved to see what would have happened .
