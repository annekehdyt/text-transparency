what an absolutely stunning movie ,
if you have 2.5 hrs
to kill ,
watch it ,
you will not regret it ,
it is too much fun !
rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulder
and although there is not anything more other than him ,
i still liked it .
the music by a.r.rehman takes time
to grow on you
but after you heard it a few time ,
you really start liking it .
