i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling
the old slovenian movie seemed to have in them ... well ,
in time i wondered
if that feeling was just the nostalgia .
or did that `` feeling '' decide to pack its bag
and say
`` goodbye '' somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history ,
and then never came back ?
or did it ?
because for me 
it came back the first time i saw `` ekspre 
ekspre '' .
and it was it is old self again.there are three quality of this movie
that makes it somewhat unique
and as enjoying
as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story 
the warmth of the color and ,
what i appreciated the most - the lack
of excessive use of verbal communication
( something many of other
( not just )
slovenian screenwriter should at least consider ) .
there is no use for word ,
when you can understand each other just as well
( yeah 
or better )
by other mean in use .
just watch bakovic and cerar .
uh.so this 
in only so many word 
is why i would recommend `` ekspre 
ekspre '' to all of you 
as a must-see slovenian movie ,
regardless of what you may heard of slovenian film
( if you ever even heard anything ,
that is ... )
.oh ,
and that scene ,
where bakovic is dancing to vivaldi 's music ... a treat.treat yourself .
watch it .
