disappointing and irritating .
the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature
but instead string together clich\u00e9s in a disjointed fashion .
character is not explored in depth .
these are puppet plunked down in a plot
he openly confesses needed a dramatic element 
the mother 's affair with her daughter 's lover .
anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situation and line ,
such standing passively
to allow her angry
daughter to slug her in the eye .
the script portrays darren
( daniel craig )
as a dr. jekyll/mr .
hyde
without any hint about why ,
except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene .
a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic .
