let me start off by saying
that i did not watch this movie at first with high expectation .
it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movie ,
and `` mtv '' was pasted on the front cover
so i was not expecting much .
what i was expecting was a tear-jerker 
overly dramatic but at least effective.i was wrong.firstly ,
let me start off
that i had never read the book nor
watched any other version of the movie.the acting was my main gripe with the film .
by god is it awful .
the main girl is pretty mediocre ,
but
when compared to the rest of the cast
she is maryl streep .
the main `` hero '' 
heath 
is just plain awful .
he can sing decent sounding clich\u00e9d song ,
but that is about it .
his acting oke the 'sad ' moment
by being so bad at point
that i just burst into laughter .
the isabel girl was pretty godawful too ,
and the other was just a flat character
that was played by an actor
that could not display emotion whatsoever .
and when he tried to 
it failed miserably .
neil patrick harris was the only decent actor ,
playing edward ,
although it is obvious the direction was bad
because even he did not live up to what i have seen him do .
oh 
and the father was not half-bad to my memory ,
but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember.the story itself was not very good .
more eakup than you can imagine .
predictable story
( until the ending ,
which i barely understood ) .
extremely one-sided character with no real depth to them ... overall just not interesting or compelling ,
nothing we have never seen
before done much better ,
and nothing worth
watching here.the ending
is suppose to be a tearjerker .
it did nothing of the sort .
the ending is not built up at all ,
it almost feel like an afterthought .
in fact 
i had to ask my friend why the ending actually happened ,
which
when they explained it to me i
must have had a look on my face of `` wait ,
when did they say that ?
what ? `` .
never a good sign .
the editing was probably the worst i have seen ,
though i do understand
the fade-ins-fade-out are done
because this was originally made for tv ,
but that is really no excuse.overall ,
the movie is just garbage .
i am a sensitive guy 
i cried during two episode of the simpson .
i never cried during this crap 
not even close .
really 
this movie is not worth your time .
if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere .
