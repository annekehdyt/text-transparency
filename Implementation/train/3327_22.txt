full house was
and still is a great show .
it is a good show for person of all age
and is also a good family show .
there really are not any show like it anymore .
the kid are very cute
and even
though it is a bit cheesy ,
it is still good 
especially for anyone
who watched it
when they were a kid .
i would love to see the cast interviewed now .
anyone
that would like to see interview of the cast ,
kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special feature of the dvd ,
should go to the petition spot website
and sign a petition
titled full house reunion on dvd
as there is a petition for this in hope
that the cast may want to do it .
yay for full house !
