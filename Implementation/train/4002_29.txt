this is complete and absolute garbage 
a fine example
of what a bad movie is like ,
this can not be appealing to anyone 
not even b-movie fan .
do not 
i repeat 
do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash .
bad acting ,
bad directing 
horrible
( but i mean really horrible )
script ,
and complete lack of an idea
as to what entertainment
( of any form )
is .
i bought the dvd for 3 dollar ,
i swear i could almost pay someone to take it .
burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me .
i like b-movie 
the killer toys 
the weird lagoon monster 
but this is nowhere near .
you know those movie
that are so bad
they are funny ?
not even .
just plain old pathetic .
