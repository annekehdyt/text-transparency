god ... where to start .
i was only able to stomach about the first 10 minute
before i turned it off in disgust .
aside from the actor playing robin hood himself ,
the rest were just terrible .
and 
i can only stretch my suspension of disbelief
only so far.from the very opening of the first episode ,
i lost count of how many error 
plot hole 
and horrible costume there were .
it began with some poor peasant
trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family .
all well and good .
however 
the poor blighter must have been mostly deaf ,
because a handful of soldier 
in full armour 
on horseback 
were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 foot.then ,
as he is running away ,
he goes from having them 10 foot behind him 
to a shot
where you can not even see them at all ,
immediately followed by them about 20 foot behind him again .
then 
he runs into some bush ,
and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldier ...
who just mere second before ,
were galloping on horseback ,
dozen of foot behind him.the `` armour '' on the soldier is so painfully obviously cloth
which they tried to make look like maille 
and miserably failed .
not to mention 
the lead soldier 's `` armour '' being about 5 size too big for the poor fellow .
seriously ,
he looks like
he is a small child
wearing his father 's over-sized armour !
finally 
robin manage to fire about 5 ,
perfectly aimed shot all around one soldier 's hand 
in the span of about 2 second 
from what appears to be a recurve bow .
no human alive could make those kind of shot ,
in that short amount of time 
with a scoped rifle 
much less a bow.after
that 
they escape the soldier
and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean `` peasant '' with digging a ditch ...
something
that all nobleman were willing to do all the time 
right ?
how this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season
is beyond me .
the production cost
( at least for what i saw )
must have soared in the dozen of dollar
( or euros ) ...
seriously - i think
a highschool drama class could have put on a better rendition .
this was so bad ,
even that terrible kevin costner version of robin hood was better.i highly suggest you skip this monstrosity ,
and go rent or buy the mid-80 's `` robin of sherwood '' series .
much better written 
acted 
costumed 
and produced.for shame 
bbc ... for shame ...
