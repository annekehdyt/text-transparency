this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempt ever at coming up with plausible answer for some of the nagging question
that have cropped up in recent scholarship
concerning the `` passion ''
( suffering and death of christ )
account in the new testament .
( what motivated judas if money was not the issue ?
what could ing the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day ?
why did pilate waffle ? )
it is a movie for the serious ,
thinking christian :
fan of `` the passion of the christ '' will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization .
as for myself 
i find the portrait painted here
-- of the willingness of ordinary person
to so blithely sacrifice common decency
when their own self-interest is at stake --
far more realistic and deeply unsettling .
( the disinterested 
`` just doing my job '' look on the face of the man
who drives the first nail in christ 's wrist is as chilling as any moment in film . )
the film makes no claim to `` authenticity '' ,
but the setting and costuming invariably feel more `` right '' than many more highly acclaimed effort .
it is a slow film but ,
if you accept its self-imposed limit
( it is ,
after all 
`` the death ''
-- not the life -- ''
of christ '' ) ,
ultimately a very rewarding one .
