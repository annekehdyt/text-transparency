this really should have been a one star ,
but there was so many 
clich\u00e9s 
predictable twist ,
seen it all before slasher flick parallel
that i actually give it an extra star for the fact
it made me laugh ...
although this was never the director intention im sure.i do not often write comment about film ,
they have to be either sensational 
or in this one case really bad.to be honet ,
as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew
it was going to be poor
as he has a unique nose
for picking out the worst film.somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through 
possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t ,
( not relay mr t ,
but you will know what i mean if you bother to watch this ) ,
if you do watch it ,
make sure you do not pay to see it .
this may have worked had
they actually put intended comedy into it ,
but im sure you will find the odd laugh here and there at the farce
of it all ...
