similar to `` on the town 
''
this musical about sailor on shore leave falls short of the later classic in term of pacing and the quality of the song ,
but it has its own charm .
kelly has three fabulous dance routine :
one with jerry the cartoon mouse of `` tom and jerry '' fame 
one with a little girl 
and a fantasy sequence
where he is a spanish lover
determined
to reach his lady on a high balcony .
sinatra ,
playing kelly 's shy 
inexperienced buddy 
and grayson 
the woman
who serves as the love interest for both man ,
do most of the singing .
iturbi provides some fine piano playing .
at nearly two and half hour 
it is a bit too long for a light musical
but it does not drag .
