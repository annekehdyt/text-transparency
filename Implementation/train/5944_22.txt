i really think
that this movie is great 
personally .
but 
in every movie there is a downer .
now 
some of you may not have watched hilary duff 's 'raise your voice ' ,
but
if you think about it ,
those two show are very very similar ,
if you know what i mean .
in 'brave new girl ' 
holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory .
in 'raise your voice ' 
terri wants to go to a conservatory in l.a.
( do not remember the name of the conservatory there ) .
they are both in the music field ,
and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester .
it is really funny
how these two film are alike .
i personally like 'brave new girl ' better than ,
'raise your voice ' though .
