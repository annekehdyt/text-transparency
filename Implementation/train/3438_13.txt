this was a cute movie until the ending .
the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate man and empower woman at their expense .
the girl refused to listen to reason and logic
and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy
who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her .
it is not by chance
that she was sitting behind the driver 's wheel in the car
as they drove away at the end
after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back .
this movie is a victory for all woman
who think
they should be in charge of all man and in control of their relationship with them .
it was a despicable movie for that reason .
