as with the other episode in this made-for-tv series expanding on the many adventure of the sea legend ,
horatio hornblower 's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.as little wesley crusher ruined many season of the next generation 
horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation .
each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lip of horatio hornblower .
immeasurably superior 
hornblower 's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden character above and below him in the chain of command .
a perfect being makes for dull story telling .
so superior is our hero ,
that even those
who attempt to help him
are powerless to do something correctly
unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.what is the sense
in telling a story about any person
who can not do wrong
and will repeatedly win at everything every single time ?
what is the point
of watching such a story ?
