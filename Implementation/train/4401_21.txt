radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening
when i grew up in the 1930s england ,
so child 's hour was a treat for me
when we had battery and an accumulator
to spare for the power .
the few programme i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind ,
and the 3
that i recall still are `` toytown '' 
one about all the animal at the zoo 
and
-- - grey owl ,
talking about the animal
he knew ,
which he called his `` other '' .
it was only in recently that i learnt
that grey owl was not a genuine `` indian '' ,
but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me `` a man becomes what he dreams '' .
would that we could all dream as world
changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney .
would that a new grey owl could influence world leader
to clean up the environment .
