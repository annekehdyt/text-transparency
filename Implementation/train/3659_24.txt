looking at some of the negative post ,
you really have to wonder what some person do for fun ... .i was lucky enough
to see the film during its all-too-ief theatrical run .
the audience laughed its head off .
i am watching a tape of it as i type
and it is still dang funny !
it is also got a sweet side 
with unexpected turn of genuine pathos .
the late 
great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely 
down-on-his-luck farmer wrenchmuller .
ariana richard and j.j. anderson are great as the lead kid .
and the actor in the martian suit ,
although limited to mime ,
do a great jobanother thing
to look for is the background detail .
the film is full of homage 
pastich 
and reference to other sf and fantasy film .
take a look at the martian costume next time .
one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume ,
another is a ghostbuster ,
a third is in a house atreides uniform ,
and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit .
