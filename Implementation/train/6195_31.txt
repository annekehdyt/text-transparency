virile 
but naive 
big joe buck leaves his home in big spring 
texas ,
and hustles off to the big apple in search of woman and big buck .
in nyc 
jb meet up with frustration 
and with `` ratso '' rizzo 
a scruffy but cordial con artist .
somehow 
this mismatched pair manage to survive each other
which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty 
sometimes utal 
urban america 
en route to a poignant ending.both funny and depressing 
our `` midnight cowboy '' rides head-on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change ,
and thus confirm to 1969 viewer
that they 
themselves 
have been swept away from the 1950 's age of innocence 
and dropped 
dorothy and toto like 
into the 1960 's age of aquarius.the film 's direction is masterful ;
the casting is perfect ;
the acting is top notch ;
the script is crisp and cogent ;
the cinematography is engaging ;
and the music enhances all of the above .
deservedly 
it won the best picture oscar of 1969 ,
and i would vote it as one of the best film of that cyclonic decade .
