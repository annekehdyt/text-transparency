necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic `` moby dick '' .
john barrymore is captain ahab ,
who falls in love with the pastor 's daughter 
joan bennett .
his other derek is a rival for ms. bennett 's affection .
when mr. barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident ,
bennett rejects him .
he must slay the whale and win bennett back ... there are several scene
which may have thrilled 1930 theater audience ;
particularly the scene
involving barrymore losing his leg .
the film has not aged well 
however ;
there are much better film from the time 
both 1920s silent and 1930s talky .
the two name attraction 
john barrymore and joan bennett are not at their best .
**** moby dick
