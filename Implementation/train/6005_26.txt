this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man .
phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver 
inspector clouseau
( in his stoicism )
and chauncey gardiner in being there
( also peter seller ) .
he is single yet does not have a clue
how to attract the opposite sex - in fact ,
he really makes no effort at all !
he has a stoicism and fatalism
that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a ave effort to transcend his extended virginhood
( he is 28
and admit
he is never had sex )
.very good outdoor shot of paris and rouen ,
where the two software person travel on business .
they try various nightclub and place but all to no avail .
my theory is that they are trying the wrong place -
they go to more-or-less 'youth ' nightclub ;
they should try the type
that has older person ,
more their own age.harel increasingly becomes isolated
and does a little de niro effort ,
as in taxi driver 
urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke
who 's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub.worth watching .
