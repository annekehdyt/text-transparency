i am sad to say
that i disagree with other person on this columbo episode .
death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me .
after a few time 
i get bored and changed the channel .
i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their role
but the story was weaker in this episode than in the other .
first 
robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland 's character .
he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife
played by patricia crowley
to see
if she is having an affair .
in return 
culp 's character blackmails the cheating wife
who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career .
out of anger 
culp kill her by striking her in the face
and setting the up the body elsewhere .
i do not know .
maybe i just did not care for this one at all .
of course 
columbo gets him in the end .
it is just the question of how .
