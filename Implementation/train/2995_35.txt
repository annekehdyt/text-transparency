a serious comedy .
ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play `` les joie de la famille ''
( later americanized as `` a very rich woman '' )
is plush 
well cast 
occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless .
a wealthy california widow ,
who appears to be frittering away her money ,
is railroaded by her two grown 
greedy daughter ,
both of whom are afraid
mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance .
the whole issue of a vital
-- but aged -- woman
sent to a rest home against her will ,
and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing ,
is touchy material for a comedy
( and to his credit ,
director david lowell rich does not overload the picture with crass gag or obvious sentiment ) .
some of the humor is a little oad
and does not work ,
yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario
and never hits a false note .
sandra dee is also good as rosalind 's granddaughter ,
and jame farentino is very charming as a young lawyer .
the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly 
and the way
in which they choose to spend their remaining time ,
that the seriousness of `` rosie !
`` 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending .
the picture leaves you smiling
-- and at the same time wondering
how many older lady there are
who were never quite so lucky .
