after being hugely entertained by mr. brosnan 's performance as a cad in `` the tailor of panama ''
( which i rate 10/10 across the board :
casting 
acting 
script 
story 
editing 
pace 
music 
emotional impact 
etc .
) 
i enthusiastically anticipated this film .
i was hugely disappointed .
it is a script reading not a film ,
vulgar for the sake of being vulgar 
bankrupt in every way
that `` the tailor of panama '' is rich and satisfying .
blame it on the screen writing and directing .
i sat in the theater waiting for the `` good part ; ''
it never came .
i neither laughed nor cried 
although one line of dialog did make me smile .
worth $ 7 ?
hardly .
