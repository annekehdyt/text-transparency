this film had no huge star in it ,
but did have a very good cast filled with excellent
supporting actor and gene tierney
before she became a big star .
with george sander 
reginald gardner 
harry carey 
bruce cabot 
jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke 
you would expect more from the film
than it actually delivered .
most of this 
i suspect 
is because of a second-rate script ,
as director henry hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm.the film is set in east africa during wwii
-- just before the american entered the war .
the brit are trying to control their african colony
while subversive nazi elemant are trying to stir up trouble among the local .
one of the white man in the film is a double-dealer
-- working for the destruction of the british empire !
but 
lovely tierney 
playing a sultan 's daughter
( !
) 
is out
to help save the day for good ol ' britain.american film maker have long sided with the empire
and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire film .
nowaday 
with changed sensibility 
the notion
of seeing the happy black native dying for queen and country seems ridiculous
-- and it would be hard to root for either side !
still 
in its day 
this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british
-- though when seen today 
the film suffer from a long-winded script and silly casting .
the one ight momant in the film is the final showdown between george sander and the enemy agent .
too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk
-- losing some of its punch .
