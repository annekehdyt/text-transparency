three stooge - have rocket ,
will travel - 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooge
and it is pretty bad .
it makes the three stooge go around the world in a daze
( from 1963 )
look like a masterpiece.the stooge are janitor at a rocket place .
they climb into a rocket
and it goes to venus .
they meet some stuff there
including a talking unicorn
they call `` uni ''
which they ing back to earth with them .
`` uni '' speak like an average 
pleasant person - 'oh 
hello .
how are you ?
lovely planet here .
hope you like it . '
hilarious.very few gag and so many of the scene just go on and on and on.the stooge arrive back from space
and the film is over as far as the story goes ,
but no one told that to the film maker for the picture continues for another 10 minute or so at a party
where nothing much happen .
the stooge leave the party
and then the film is almost over.high point of the film - the end
where the stooge sing a dapper little song about their journey .
the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two py .
brutal.another writer mentioned the fine musical score .
huh ?
the only music i
even noticed were two classic tune - i will take romance
and there goes
that song again ,
both of which are played at the party .
and *that* really is the high point of the picture - music from old columbia films.the tall sexy blonde was nice.awful - a and new vh video from the 99 cent only store .
