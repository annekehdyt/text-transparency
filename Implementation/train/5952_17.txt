what i love about this show is that it follows the life of modern witch
and it is a blast to experience their everyday love 
humor and adventure .
the literature of magic is so diverse 
portraying the idea of classical 
medieval and modern wizardry 
like harry potter and saina .
with saina the teenage witch 
this show is so fun and unique
because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry 
seven season worth !
this show has so many great quality
and it is a joy to watch saina live her daily life in the mortal and `` other '' realm .
i would recommend this to any family
because the television series is clean 
funny and adventurous .
classic !
