i recently watched belle epoque ,
thinking
it might be wonderful
as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film .
i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film .
maybe the conflict i had was that from the time
the movie was filmed to now ,
the plot of a man falling for beautiful woman and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many time .
aside from predictability of the plot ,
some scene in the film felt really out of place with the storyline
( ex .
a certain event at the wedding ) .
at time the film was a bit preachy
in it is ideas
and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church .
the only thing
the film had going
for it
was the cutesy moment 
the scenery ,
and the character of violeta being a strong 
independent woman during time
when woman were not really associated with those characteristic .
