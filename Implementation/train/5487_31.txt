i noticed
that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 ,
but that this one is not even in the top 100.this movie has a bad reputation
because of ewok ,
but there are so many reason to love this movie :
-the rescue of han solo from jabba :
this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot
that was established
when we first met the character in a new hope.-the emperor was finally revealled :
well alright this might not work as well now
that the prequel are out
but this was the first time
we saw the emperor as kids.-the speeder bike chase :
alright 
so this was a special effect moment .
but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moment in all the film ! -the 3 part climax :
1 )
the battle of endor
( led by han and leia ) 2 )
luke confronts his father and the fall of the emperor 3 )
the destruction of the second death star
( lando 's moment )
-the final celeation with our hero :
like i said ,
this movie gets a lot of crap
because of the ewok
but i think
it is kind of cool
that
while the entire galaxy celeates the fall of the empire ,
our hero are having their own private party in the wood with each other.all in all this was a great final chapter for our hero and a fitting end to the star war story .
