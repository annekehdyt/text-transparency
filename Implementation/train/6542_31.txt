why watch this ?
there is only one reason
and that is for the greatness of john saxon .
i love his acting .
my most favorite appearance by him are in nightmare on elm street 1,3 ,
and 7 as nancy 's father a cop 
black christmas as a cop 
and from dusk till dawn again as a cop .
when i was rummaging through my local mall video outlet i came across the film zombie death house and i quickly tossed it back
but before moving on i noticed
that john saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time
that i have ever heard of a director .
this intrigued me
( also the cheap $ 9.00 price tag )
and i and i had to have it .
upon coming home i realized
that this film did not live up to saxon 's other work even his acting ,
which may have been muddled by the added pressure of directing .
but it was not just him the other actor sucked too .
it seemed
as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot
and told now guys you really have to act .
the film even looks of 80 's porn quality .
i can not in good faith recommend this film to casual viewer ,
but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80 's
who missed out on the culture
that came from that era
by being born to late 
or a fan of crap film
than this one is for .
also if you dig john saxon as i do .
