a nice shirely temple short .
child actor screaming their line seemed to be the norm for that day and time .
perhaps being `` seen and not heard '' needed to be made up for .
aside from that this is fun .
given the film era there are certain aspect of the thing 
from a social viewpoint ,
that strike me as both very progressive and liberal .
i will not go into those here ,
i would rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see
if you spot those element .
as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination
that was already developing for temple .
that makes it worth watching
if you are a temple fan .
for other its a cool way to kill ten minute
while you are waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove .
