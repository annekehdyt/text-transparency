oh 
what a bad 
bad 
very bad movie !
cowritten by and starring sylvester stallone\u0097that should have been enough\u0097and featuring too many rock-climbing scene 
vertigo 
falling 
and scene-chewing villain and a botched airborne heist .
there are two plot 
both lame .
one involves a traumatic failed rescue ,
and the other involves bad person wrecking an airplane for booty ,
and killing various harmless person whenever possible .
the usually reliable john lithgow ,
perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product ,
is reduced to sneering and calling those
for whom he does not care `` bostid ! ''
in a vague approximation of an english accent .
janine turner ,
who was sprightly and enigmatic
when she played maggie on northern exposure ,
is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot .
stallone is stolid and muscle-headed .
no deathless line in this one .
no living line 
either .
