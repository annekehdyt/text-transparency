this is a truly classic movie in its story 
acting 
and film presentation .
wonderful actor are replete throughout the whole movie 
miss sullivan ,
and jimmy stewart being the foremost character .
in real life she greatly admired ,
and liked jimmy ,
and indeed gave him his basically first acting role ,
and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set .
the `` chemistry '' between the two was always apparent 
and so warm and enjoyable to behold .
she was such a beautiful 
young woman ,
and so sweet in her personality portrayal .
the story of these two young person ,
and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch 
and pure magical entertainment .
heart warming presentation are also given by the other supporting actor in this marvelous story/movie .
i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic ,
that has a special appeal for all generation .
a must see for all !
