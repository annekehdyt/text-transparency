i saw this movie a few year back on the bbc i sat thru it .
how ?
i do not know ,
this is way up there in the `` so bad it'good `` chart kidman 
baldwin 
and pullman must cringe
when they see it now.i think
woody allen would have worked wonder with the outlandish plot ,
and baldwin 's part could have been played with gusto by leslie nelson.it was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but life 's too short .
the few minute i watched was for the lovely nicole
she was so hot around 93 ,
has baldwin ever made a good movie ?
pullman played his stock in trade `` nice but dim ''
character the f-word coming out of his mouth
when the lady from `` frasier '' miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sound so wrong .
stay well away .
