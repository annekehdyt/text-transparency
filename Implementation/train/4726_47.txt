remake
( and sequel )
have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the medium .
it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though .
if you take what is good of the original
and build upon it
and update key feature too current standard ,
you can have a success .
note 
such film like the thief of bagdad
( 1924/1940 )
or king kong
( 1933/2005 )
succeeded in their attempt .
other like king kong
( 1976 )
fail 
miserably.brief encounter
( 1945 )
is the template for this film .
it is as perfect
as could be made on such a subject
and we rate it imdb**********ten .
the story is simple 
love 
innocently
found by accident and tragically lost .
why 
it just happened for the two ( 2 )
principal involved at the wrong time .
these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson .
neither are conventionally leading star material 
but quality character actor .
for the detail watch the film.now what went wrong ?
a t.v .
movie 
remade practically scene for scene with name actor richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb******six .
both actor though appear disinterested 
just showing up to punch their time-clock and pick up their check .
neither are involved with their character or with each other .
you do not believe
they are in love or when
they finally separate
it is any great loss to either of them .
that should not be
and that is why it fails in its intent .
sometimes it is just better to leave thing alone .
