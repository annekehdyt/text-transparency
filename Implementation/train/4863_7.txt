this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood
to portray reagan 's administration as incompetent and bungling .
some mistake may have been made at the time of the crisis ,
but i am sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie .
my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone ,
but i was wrong this time .
there are apparently many other .
