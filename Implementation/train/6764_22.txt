review for this film were lukewarm at best
while expectation were sky high :
a big budget 
ton of popular faces 
a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves .
the end result is a disaster .
alice tremblay 's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way
to entertain it is audience
( i did not hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation ) ,
going through it is page-thin story line and one-dimensional character
without a single spark ,
not a sign of the magic
it wished
it had .
the 90 minute of film here are sterile with clumsy direction
and some good actor doing their best to come of as professional in a feature
that certainly could not seem that great an idea on the set 
let alone on paper .
'l'odyss\u00e9e d'alice tremblay ' is a collage of comic sketch ,
linked together with a ( very )
thin layer of good idea .
avoid or boredom will haunt you .
