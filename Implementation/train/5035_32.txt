this movie is not as good
as all the movie of christ i have ever seen .
and i am quite amazed
that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus ,
when the scripture
( as well the other movie )
state differently .
it lacks also a very important issue :
the resurrection.. none of the other movie skip this very important part :
the faith of all of us christian lies in this very event .
as paul says in one of his letter
`` if christ did not rise from the dead ,
our faith is vain '' .
a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the street the remain of the palm
that were used
when jesus entered jerusalem .
finally 
and in opposition to my jewish co-commentator 
jesus was not a myth .
and as a matter of fact 
he was also a jew .
there are plenty of document
( relgious and secular )
that prove the existence of this extraordinary man
( or should i said ,
god become a man )
that indeed changed mankind .
i strongly advise him
( given he is a historian )
to read about flavius josephus 
the most illiant jewish commentator of the 1st .
century .
