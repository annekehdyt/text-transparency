the priyadarshan/paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the like of hera pheri and hungama
so i went into the movie
( at an indian multiplex )
with high hope 
especially after the slick promos .
unfortunately 
like hulchul before it 
this movie was a huge disappointment.like other have commented 
the premise of the movie ,
which was already stale to begin with ,
just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering .
after a while 
you just want the movie to end
so you can go home
( if i had been watching this at home ,
it would have been much easier to cut my loss ) .
akshay kumar 's performance is average at best and john aaham should not try doing comedy again .
the comedy aspect of the movie overall were pretty week .
i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie .
definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs
that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana .
paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moment 
but overall ,
because his role and character was not given much room to grow ,
he did not make much of an impact in this film.neha dhupia ,
who makes only an appearance in the movie ,
was fun
to look at
while she was on screen .
and some of the song are fun .
especially the opening and closing song of ada and kiss me baby 
respectively .
otherwise 
you are better off just passing on this movie .
