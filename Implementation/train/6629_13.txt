the radar man from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950 's serial .
the special effect are pretty cheap ,
the lunar rover are obviously world war ii surplus jeep with painted plywood over them 
and the like .
the acting is only so-so .
it does inspire the imagination of child ,
to whom i believe
this was directed to .
by today 's standard 
it is boring 
cheap 
and bad .
there is also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episode of natural disaster .
