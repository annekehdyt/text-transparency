there are four great movie
depicting the vietnam war .
they are ( in no particular order :
apocalypse now 
born on the fourth of july 
platoon ,
and finally tigerland .
all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the man in it .
tigerland focuses on man in advanced training for the vietnam war .
the character of boz is one of the most important depiction of a man questioning war 
and the absurdity of it .
this has been done in many war movie 
but rarely in boot camp .
also 
this is a very complex character ,
whose method with dealing with his feeling
and emotion are the driving force of this movie .
the character of boz makes this movie so good .
it is a shame
it did not get a major release .
it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforemantioned movie title .
