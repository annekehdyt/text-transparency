totally ridiculous .
if you know anything about poker ,
you will find
it absolutely appalling but also entertaining
because it is so clueless .
the nerd
who made this movie
is obviously very religious
and knows slightly about the game of poker ,
but i doubt he is ever played above 3-6 .
( i think
he also knows nothing of golf . )
where to start .
i have seen better production in the intro
to film class
i took freshman year of film school .
the actor to watch in this movie are queen momma 
scotty nguyen 
and the loser
who can never win at poker .
everyone else is as wooden
as they come 
like bad porn actor .
*spoiler* the man
the movie starts with in the opening sequence
is the only reason
the film got made .
he is a railbird
who does not play poker
and never has a line of dialogue ,
but the actor is the man
who obviously paid for the movie .
i can not think of a more useless waste of money
than this man shelling out for this pointless production .
it is fitting
that he had such a useless role.there
is very little poker in this movie .
most of the time is spent on useless side character
whose plot are not resolved in the slightest .
queen momma does have a show-stealing scene
where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window
and try to shoot his ain out .
also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give illiant performance
when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady
who robs them .
their subtle performance are easily among the film 's highlight .
it makes you wonder
why they bothered getting all these white person
to play the leads.in conclusion 
complete nonsense .
plan 9 from outer space has slightly more coherency .
if you play poker
though you might want to have a laugh .
also
if you are christian
you might enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious conversation
that pepper the movie like pointless pepper .
i hate movie made by religious person .
especially one
who think
they know something about thing
they know nothing about .
it is sad
that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty
as i can not help but think less of them .
they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounder .
