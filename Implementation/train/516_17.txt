pure orson welle genius makes this one of the greatest of movie .
welle is drawn into a murder conspiracy
only to be set up as the fall guy ,
which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment `` big dummy
that i am . ''
plot is so complex
that i still do not know
whether the victim knew
that his life was about to be lost .
the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirror is one of the most amazing ever filmed .
that scene alone is worth the price of admission .
this is the only time
that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character .
no one but welle would have had the nerve
to cut her hair
and dye it assy blond .
no one should miss this picture .
