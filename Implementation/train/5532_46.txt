guy and doll is a movie itching for a remake .
it was made forty-eight year ago .
its two main star are either dead or 409 pound .
although a remake 
with big star now 
would be box-office success ,
it would not be able to capture the magic
that went into this version .
its boundless energy can not be recaptured ,
nor can the pure joy you get
when watching something like this :
a huge 
widescreen 
big entertainment movie.marlon brando
( who last clocked in at 409 lbs .
last time i heard )
plays sky masterson 
one of the biggest gambler in new york .
frank sinatra is nathan detroit ,
whose as-often-as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it crap game is city-wide famous .
however ,
when the one place he has left
to hold
it is charging $ 1,000 ,
detroit needs the money fast .
he bets masterson $ 1,000
that he can not take missionary sarah brown
( jean simmon )
to havana with him the next day.guy and doll is basically nothing more than unsavory type
singing and dancing ,
which usually ,
as it does here ,
add up to fun .
it is obvious to see how this was a broadway musical :
there were not that many set ,
and the scene were long .
if i was to complain about one thing ,
it is how uneven the song were .
at time 
there were two song in a scene ;
other time 
thirty minute went
by without one .
guy and doll is never boring 
just a great time.my rating :
8/10not rated .
