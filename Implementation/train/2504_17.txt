`` arahan '' adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre .
to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow 's film is a mistake.firstly
the fight scene are nothing new .
all
that is presented here
has been done before and better by the like of yimou zhang 
tony jaa and jackie chan .
fight in intelligent motion picture need logic .
there seems no point serving blow
that have no damaging effect as in the `` matrix '' sequels.the attractive female lead so-yi yoon captivated the screen
but she never convincingly conquered the physical demand of the role
as ziyi zhang had done so easily in `` house of flying dagger '' .
having a martial art background serves well in kung fu movie .
to cast actor inexperienced in these skill is a serious mistake
( see aya ueto in `` asumi '' )
unless you are a very talented director
which as `` arahan '' proves seung-wan ryoo is not .
