how amazing this film is !
i have seen it
over and over throughout the year and i am always spellbound by it .
the reason
why the film is so easy to re-watch is 
of course 
the arresting performance
given by the young bette davis .
she not only steals every scene
that she is in ,
but is actually much prettier and better photographed here
( not to mention sexier )
than she was in any of the film
that she had made thus far at her home studio 
warner brother
( this film was made by r.k.o .
radio picture ) .
she wears a very flattering make-up
and has very attractive hairstyle and oh ,
those lovely big eye
( especially 
in the restaurant scenes
that take place in london 's soho ) .
her body was so curvy
when she was young .
get a load of it in the cheap negligee
that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard .
and oh boy 
she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene .
howard is a little too nervous throughout ,
but he does captures the hero 's sensitivity .
france dee score as the sweet 
pretty young sally
who truly loves him .
max steiner 's score is both charming and poignant .
splendid performance and thirty flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel .
