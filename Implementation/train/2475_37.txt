some of those guy
that watch film
and complain about them for a living
are forgetting something :
dvd menu system .
i tell you the person ,
i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 time .
it was awesome .
a cinematic tapestry of cascading illiance
that had me from where
it was ,
which was the very beginning .
many time the sum and bam !
i was hooked .
over and over and over .
and over .
`` doot de doot 
de doo de dodedo . ''
and that is just the soundtrack !
i is laid aside in the bed 
curled up with my vaio .
the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft
is again soft .
the cat is comfortable and my ankle
which crosses in me ,
is already rested .
i popped in the dvd .
i was mesmerized .
through the night .
`` doot de doot 
de doo de dodedo .
`` the blob .
see it .
steve queen 
two cop 
and one girl in a dress .
two thumb way up !
