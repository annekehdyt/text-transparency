yike did this movie blow .
the character were weak 
the plot weaker .
i figured this could not be too bad
because it has christoper walken 
oop .
he must have done this
because he was bored and needed the money .
the character were supposed to be irish
but noone had an irish accent .
i am desperately trying to find something nice about this ,
i can not except walken did a fine job with a wooden character .
find something to read 
or watch discovery ,
do not ever see this movie .
