level one 
horror.when i saw this film for the first time at 10 ,
i knew
it would give me nightmare .
it did .
surprisingly 
as i recall 
it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster
that caused them.level two 
psychoanalytic theory.later as an adult ,
i saw the story
for what it was :
what if the savage 
unrestrained instinct we all repress became manifest.level three 
pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot 's `` what if '' is through the science fiction genre .
this is pure science fiction 
not the `` cowboys in space ''
that passes for the genre today.after 43 year ,
forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction film .
if planning a remake 
skg or lucas ,
watch out !
