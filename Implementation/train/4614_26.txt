the unborn is a roger corman production
and as such is nasty and tasteless .
if you hate pregnant woman ,
check out this movie
because it is chock full of preggo killing and failed abortion .
brooke adams star as virginia .
her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic
because they can not have kid on their own .
there they meet dr. meyerling
( james karen of rotld 1 and 2 ) .
dr. meyerling has had a very high success rate
at getting couple pregnant .
( insert joke here . )
is it
because he is creating some genetic killer supermutant baby ?
that is what virginia starts to think
when she starts having some odd side effect and extreme moodiness from the treatment .
that is when she starts taking matter into her own hands.on this one ,
you will have to get the rest of the detail somewhere else
because if i told ya all the goody this one had you might hurt yourself putting
it on your netflix rental queue too quickly .
it is a bit slow-moving for a while
but once it picks up in the final third ,
all system are go !
very highly recommended by me on the strength of its un-pc fetal violence .
33 1/2 out of seventeen star .
