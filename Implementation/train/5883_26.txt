when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80 's to what passes for entertainment today ,
his film keep looking better and better .
`` dressed to kill ,
`` blow out '' ,
`` body double '' 
`` scarface '' and `` carlito 's way '' are all superb work of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his power .
the guy had a long run of better than average film .
this is pure hitchcock with an 80 's dash of lurid perversion 
an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twist 
huge helping of style 
a stunning pino donaggio score 
and a trashy 
giallo-inspired plot .
de palma 's love of complex camera-work and luscious 
blood-smudged visual helps overcome the logical hole
while the terrific performance of dennis franz 
keith gordon
( a good director in his own right ) ,
nancy allen
( de palma 's wife at the time )
and michael caine make every scene special .
let the virtuoso take you on a surreal 
scary ,
erotically charged odyssey
and you will enjoy every frame of `` dressed
to kill '' .
