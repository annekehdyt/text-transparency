outside of the fact
that george lopez is a pretentious jerk ,
his show is terrible.nothing about lopez
has ever been funny .
i have watched his stand-up
and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.his stuff comes across
as vindictive and his animosity towards white person oozes out of every single pore of his body.i have laughed at white person joke from many a comedian and love many of them.this guy has a grudge
that will not end.i feel bad for hispanic
who have only this show
to represent themselves.the show plot
are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent.canned laugh at the dumbest comment and scenes.might be why
this show is always on at 2am in replay .
