humm 
an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair 
i wasn\u00b4t expecting very much ,
to be honest and in fact ,
i took even less than i was expecting .
it doesn\u00b4t mean this movie is the worst i
have seen
because i have watched worse thing than this
but the plot was most of the time confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scene are the only thing saving this .
apart from that you are going to love some special effect ,
they are really cheesy and bad .
now i only want to watch `` troll 3 '' by this same director ,
sure it is not going to be worse than that .
