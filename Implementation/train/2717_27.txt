typical de palma movie made with lot 's of style and some scene 's
that will ing you to the edge of your seat.most
certainly the thing
that makes this movie better as the average thriller ,
is the style .
it has some illiantly edited scene 's and some scene 's
that are truly nerve wrecking
that will ing you to the edge of your seat .
the best scene 's from the movie ; the museum scene and the elevator murder .
there are some mild erotic scene
's and the movie pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer
to fully appreciate this movie .
so this movie might not be suitable for everybody.the story itself is also quite good
but it really is the style
that makes the movie work !
it might be for the fan
only but also casual viewer should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie.there are some nice character
portrayed by a good cast .
michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well
as she is good looking
( not bad for a 49-year old !
)
.the musical score by pino donaggio
is also typically de palma like and suit the movie very well 
just like his score for the other de palma movie 
`` body double '' .brilliant nerve wrecking thriller .
i love de palma ! 10/10
