the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created .
i cried the whole way through 
from start to end .
watching the show you are immediately captured by a man 's struggle
to live
without pain ,
to live a life we would take for granted .
the first time i heard the title ,
i was almost scared to see the program ,
it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life .
i truly felt for him .
the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin .
could you imagine doing that ?
even more so ,
even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain
he still opened up his own charity .
( debra )
jonny is one of the only person
that deserves true respect and admiration ,
he is the definition of a role model ,
what a true and undeniable hero he was !
