i really liked batman :
dead end ,
i thought
that it had a theatrical feel
to it
and that
given a chance
collora could make a fine film .
this trailer did not quite give me the same impression .
the story line 
or potential story line 
was quite good
but due to the acting and special effect left me feeling
like this would have made a good tv movie or television show.first ,
michael o'hearn is not that good a superman .
i actually thought
he 
in his ief appearance 
made a decent clark kent .
sorry 
i just do not think of superman
as being that buff .
the suit kent wore masked his size .
batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman .
supe is toned no doubt but not bulk .
anyway 
i did not care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy .
now this may not be just o'hearn 's fault ,
collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction.second ,
the special effect for flying were cheezy .
superman flies through the sky .
if was obvious
that this superman flew close to the ground 
with the telephone cable and building visible above him .
i do not think
there were any full body shot of superman flying .
evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso.all in all
it was a good trailer .
i would probably pay to see a film ,
if ever made ,
and would be sure to catch it on television .
the story line 
an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industry 
superman jealous of lois 's attraction to wayne 
lex and twoface teaming to beat superman
and the joining of force between batman and superman is a good one .
i am sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company ,
even o'hearn could deliver a decent film .
certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately .
