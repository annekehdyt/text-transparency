this movie only gets a second star
because i work downtown and liked seeing
it destroyed .
the effect were pretty good- i hear
it was the most expensive korean film ever made .
being the most expensive
and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money .
i rented
it so i will not complain too much about what i paid ,
but it was a couple hour
that i will never get back .
plot hole abound .
terrible acting all across the board .
i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie ,
life is too short .
if your friend want to watch this ,
run away .
i can not stress enough
how bad this film was .
where the hell did the second dragon come from ?
why did not he show up sooner ?
how did they have rocket launcher on dinosaur just 500 year ago ?
