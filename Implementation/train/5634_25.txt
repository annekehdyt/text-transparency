i saw this movie
when i was little -
it was called `` glacier fox '' .
i was totally traumatized by it !
it follows a cute little fox family around .
the beginning was great
and i remember becoming very attached to the little fox .
i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater
while i was in hysteric .
i will not tell you what happened ,
but let 's just say
it does not end well for all of the fox .
i was used to disney type nature film
where the animal do not really die .
oh man .
this movie made me cry for hour .
it was a good movie ...
i think
- i was really little
and truth be told -all i
remember is being happy for the fox
and then seeing one of them die .
rent it
if you can ,
but do not show your kid !
