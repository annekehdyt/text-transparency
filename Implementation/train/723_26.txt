i personally liked this movie
and am alarmed at the rating 's some person have given it .
it is a movie
based on a comic book
and it is animated ,
now if you do not like comic book or animation then of course
you will not like this movie
so why did you watch
and bother to rate
it is beyond me .
though 
if you are a fan of interesting 
strong character and heroic
( sexy )
woman kicking butt
and saving the world
( hell )
you will love this movie .
i thought
the story really pulled me in
and it was a very cool movie .
quite anime-esque or more like some of the american movie following this new trend of adult animation .
like titan a.e .
meet 's the live action version of punisher .
in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind
looking for a fun movie .
