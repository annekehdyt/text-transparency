i
am in iraq right
now doing a job
that gives plenty of time for watching movie .
we also have access to plenty of pirated movie ,
this gem came along with 11 other movie ,
and this is easily the worst i have seen in a long time .
i have seen a few other review
that claim
this movie does not take itself too seriously 
but really ,
i think
that is a cover up for the fact
that its horrible .
it is not tongue in cheek ,
the writer really thought
they were improving on the movie blade .
this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin ,
which
if you have not seen ,
i recommend .
at least that movie is so unbelievably bad
that you will laugh harder
than you thought possible .
this is right at that cusp of no redeeming quality what so ever .
from the bad acting 
to clich\u00e9 visual
( ie opening credit ) ,
to the adobe premier special effect .
they could not even get blank for the gun ,
which may have to do with where the movie was filmed ,
but if you are going to use effect ,
make them close to accurate .
as for the cast 
it seems like they just went to a tae bo class
and picked up the first not to ugly chick
that walked out .
once again 
like ron hall in vampire assassin 
do not let stunt folk act ,
they can not .
also 
the comment about this being a `` return of old vampire movie '' ... no ,
it is not .
this is exactly
what all new vampire movie are about .
buffy the vampire slayer 
blade 
underworld 
they are all about some super star fighting the vampire .
this is the newest vampire genre 
with bad blood 
fake scream 
and cheesy over acting .
obviously anyone
who wrote a good review about this
is somehow connected to the movie 
or friend of the cast .
but what do i care ,
i paid 33 cent for it .
anyway ,
to wrap this up ,
someone in their first semester of film school
decided to make a movie ,
i give them credit
because it is better
than i could do .
of course i also know
i can not make movie
so i do not try .
i do know how to watch movie though .
i work 12 hour night 
6 day a week 
i have seen several thousand in the year i have been out here
and this was so bad
that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack .
