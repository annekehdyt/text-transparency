okay 
the story makes no sense ,
the character lack any dimensionally ,
the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie ,
the cinematography is dismal ,
and only editing saves a bit of the muddle ,
but sam '' peckinpah directed the film .
somehow 
his direction is not enough .
for those
who appreciate peckinpah and his great work ,
this movie is a disappointment .
even a great cast can not redeem the time
the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah 
jame caan 
robert duvall 
burt young 
bo hopkin 
arthur hill 
and even gig young ing to their work .
watch the great peckinpah film .
skip this mess .
