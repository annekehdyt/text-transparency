this is one of the best animated family film of all time .
moreover 
virtually all of the serious rival for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli .
specifically 
other great film include `` my neighbor totoro '' and `` kikki 's delivery service . ''
spirited away is quite good ,
but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenager and adult .
the one thing
that sets `` laputa :
castle in the sky '' apart from other film by miyazaki is
that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride.why
is this film so good ?
because it is a complete package :
the animation is very well done ,
and the story is truly engaging
and compelling.most japanese anime is imaginative 
but decidedly dark or cynical or violent ;
and the animation itself is often jerky 
stylized 
and juvenile .
none of these problem plague castle in the sky .
it has imagination to burn ,
and the character are well drawn ,
if slightly exaggerated version of realistic person .
( none of those trench-coat wearing poser )
there is plenty of adventure 
but not blood and gore .
the animation is smooth ,
detailed ,
and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shot .
the background are wonderful.the voice
acting in the dubbed english version is first rate 
particularly the two lead 
pazo
( jame van der beek )
and sheeta
( anna paquin ) .
the sound engineering is great 
too .
use your studio sound ,
if you have got it.one aspect
that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained .
laputa was once inhabited ,
and is now abandoned .
why ?
we never know .
we know as much as we need to know ,
and then we just have to accept the rest ,
which is easy to do
because the invented world is so fully realized .
indeed 
it is fair to say
that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor character ,
who are for the most part one-dimensional stock character
( e.g. 
gruff general 
silly sidekick 
kooky old miner 
etc . )
highly recommended for person
aged 6 to 60 !
