most of the feedback i have heard
concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed .
a couple even saying
that they think `` it sucked '' .
well ,
to those person i say ,
get some f @ ckin imagination and go f @ ck yourself .
this was a very entertaining flick.the story starts with this mechanical bug
which attack and somehow transforms its host into these gwar-costume looking ,
deathbot called necroborgs .
eventually you learn
that these mechanical bug also attach a little parasite onto you ,
which then is able to control your action due to hot-wiring your nervous system .
unfortunately for two love-seeking lonely young adult ,
they happen to cross path with the mechanical bug ,
and
before you know
it transformation are taking place
and blood is being splattered .
is there a way
to stop the transformation ?
maybe a way
to stop this mechanical bug threat ?
why do the necroborgs fight one another ?
do the two desperate single get to express their feeling for one another
and do the nasty ?
only one way
to find out.going into meatball machine i
was kinda wary due to the mixed reaction ,
but it turned out being a great surprise .
a few unanswered question 
some average acting at time and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak point
i can think of .
from the anime feel
to it ,
to the parasite becoming little character themselves and even to the low budget feel ,
this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses .
with a ever-developing story
that is interesting enough
to keep oneself
asking question throughout
mixed with the cool make-up effect and blood splatter ,
this is one flick fan of bizarro/horror/tetsuo/splatter fan should check out .
8 outta 10
