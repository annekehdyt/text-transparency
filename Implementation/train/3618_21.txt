pet sematary 
though a nice 80 's horror movie 
with a nice director and atmosphere 
is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati .
it is clear that stephen king has copied almost all the idea from this director
( the movie zeder was made
before king wrote the book )
the cat 
the ground 
everything was copied ,
this is a case of plagiary 
but ,
being stephen kind a famous american writer ,
it is totally normal
that he can get away with this ,
it is obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italian movie with no -budget
( and in part ,
it is crap itself ... )
but the original idea ,
i repeat it ,
it is italian director avatilet the world know
