i saw this movie a few day ago ...
what the hell was that ? i like movie with brian o'halloran 
they are funny and enjoyable .
when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great ,
this one could be really good ... some parody for slasher or another gore movie ... but.. then i read a preview
and thought right
it could be good anyway ...
but it was not ... my opinion :
if like movie they look little bit like documentary ,
with little bit of comedy try some moore 's movie or alien autopsy ,
they are really about something .
this one was empty .
and put a comedy to title ... no comment ...
really bad joke
