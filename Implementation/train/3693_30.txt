j\u00f6rg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movie and theme at time 
even for my taste
but his movie are always something special and hard to classify .
they are artistically made 
with also often deeper meaning to its theme .
this movie is a perfect
example of his work.it is also really hard to label this movie .
it is not really a movie with a story to it 
in a sense
of having a beginning 
middle and end in it .
it also does not have a main character
but instead focuses on 7 different suicide and killing ,
on 7 different days.all different story are being told with lot of class ,
though some of them are of course more 'interesting ' and realistic than the other .
they are not necessarily connected
but yet together they still tell a story .
the movie does not feel disjointed at all .
all different story have a different feel to it
and buttgereit tells the story
without hardly using any word
( also typical for his style )
but instead lets the image and obvious sensible emotion of the character tell the entire story .
it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch.again ,
the production values all are not too high
and this might be something
that might scare off some person .
it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark 
disturbing and depressing theme.a buttgereit movie
that i 'enjoyed ' watching.7/10
