melvyn dougla and joan blondell co-star in `` the amazing mr. william 
'' a 1939 mystery/comedy
that is quite good ,
although forgotten 
probably due to the number of incredible film
that came out in 1939.dougla
play a talented police detective married to his job ,
while his girlfriend wait for a wedding
that is constantly postponed .
what happens in this film is no exception -
he is called to a murder scene
just
as he is about to walk down the aisle yet again.both star were excellent at comedy ,
worked together well
( and often ) ,
and help make this battle of the sex fun .
edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support.as
you can read in other review ,
melvyn dougla does not make much of a woman.entertaining if a little on the long side.one of the comment here trashed melvyn dougla 
one of our greatest actor .
he literally floated effortlessly through dozen of film as the other man and the best friend
before coming into his own in film as an old man .
he was not lazy 
but rather 
a very hard-working actor
( who made it look easy )
who had a broadway career
simultaneously with his film career .
he just was not cast as a leading man in film
or given very challenging role under the studio system .
i challenge anyone to see his devastating performance in `` hud ''
and `` i never sang for my father ''
and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .
