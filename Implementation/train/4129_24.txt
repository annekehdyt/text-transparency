i really do not understand why person get so upset and pan this movie !
remember folk 
this is an snl movie ,
not anything
that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction !
the lady man is a hilarious movie 
albeit stupid at time 
with a wacked-out cast and 
as usual 
wonderful performance
by will ferrel and tim meadow .
yes some of the joke are stupid ,
and yes 
the character are unbelievable but its comedy !
i really do not understand
how anyone could not laugh a lot during this hilarious film .
anyway 
all i ask is that person take this as it is
-- an snl 
silly and irreverent comedy .
nothing that will win award 
but nonetheless 
some modern comedy gold .
