this movie certainly proves ,
that also the good american can do terribly good propaganda .
no question being asked ,
no comment being made on power abuse or police terror ,
when jame stewart 
solid and convincing as always ,
solves all the story from dillinger to 5th column more or less singlehandedly .
june allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family value and e.j .
hoover is executive producer.and child or non guilty bystander are never harmed ,
when the professional execute .
not to speak of civil right ,
which are never oken or home ,
which are never intruded .
and if the fbi service would not be enough ,
steward also gives his son 's life for the country in ww ii .
perfectly made ,
if you would not know better ... .
