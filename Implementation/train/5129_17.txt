i saw this on the big screen
and was encapsulated with it .
the period of queen victoria 's younger year are a mystery
and this is a perfect description
of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest role in the world.the script is perfect ,
the acting is amazing ,
the history and attention to detail is out of this world .
emily blunt is perfect as victoria .
funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the 1st and william iv is played by prince albert !
( think blackadder )
.this portrayal of victoria show
that she was a rebellious young woman
once -
i am sure
she would have been on jeremey kyle show
if it had been around then :
`` my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life '' .a perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history .
