i love special effect and witnessing new technology
that make science fiction seem real .
the special effect of this movie are very good .
i have seen most of this movie ,
since it is been airing on hbo for the past couple of month .
i must admit ,
i may have missed a few scene ,
but i am usually drawn into movie ,
and have seen some scene more than once .
but every time i see some of `` hollow man 
''
i feel depressed 
almost like a `` film noir . ''
i am not sure why ;
perhaps it is that i do not want kevin bacon to be evil ,
and there is disappointment in that .
but i think
it is witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes .
regardless 
i can recommend this movie for excitement
( although some part move slowly ) ,
but i do not recommend for youngster under the age of 14
( perhaps 12 ,
if they are mature ) .
