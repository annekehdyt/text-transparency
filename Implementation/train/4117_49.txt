stephen j. cannell apparently decided a few year ago
that he would oaden his horizon and dabble in horror .
the result ,
`` dead above ground '' ,
is an abysmal piece of junk .
now 
had i noticed his name in association with this particular film i would have put it back but no ,
i did not have my glass on
and therefore i missed it 
damn 
i really do need to ing those with me
while video shopping .
first question would be ,
who the heck is the target audience for this ?
it is almost like a `` scary '' kid movie ,
but then again there is topless babe and some gore and some bad word spouted here and there .
the main character are so cute
that you want to see someone 
anyone ,
go after them with farm implement of some kind .
seems that a guy opens a bed and eakfast
that has a checkered past 
a child-murdering witch
that collected child 's teeth lived there .
probably something the real estate agent failed to mention .
of course now in the modern day there is a little girls ghost around
to warn the real-live little girl
that now lives there
that something bad is going to happen .
it does ,
and there is also two bubba
that were squatting on that property
when the new owner took over so
they are out for revenge too .
this whole thing has the feel of some made-for-cable junk
that is for the kid at halloween except for 
of course 
the thing
that are not suitable for little kid ,
so not only is this mediocre ,
it is confused 
too .
a big boo and hiss to anchor bay for putting this out too ,
considering their usual track record with fine release this is a new low .
the uk gets a phantasm box set ,
we get `` the tooth fairy '' .
hardly seems fair .
1/10 
absolute garbage .
