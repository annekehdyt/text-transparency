this movie masquerades as a social commantary ,
when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous
as the very racism it condemns .
the premise of this movie :
african-american = strong ... any other race = weak .
the worst part is
when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy .
the jewish guy 
in stereotypical fashion 
crumble in fear
and starts pleading for his life ...
but the big 
strong 
defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear .
we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member
as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist .
the raped white girl 
of course 
begins considering lesbianism
since she is just a weak white girl after all .
when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity member
he of course must fall in with the skinhead ,
who are incredible coward ;
especially the big muscular guy
who is beaten down quickly by the strong black man .
wait ... busta rhyme beat up a guy twice his size ? ? ?
yeah 
right.of course the black man never reject their own person and omar epps move in with them easily .
the scene
where ice cube threatens his white roommate
and keeps them in line
are just stupid
-- of course he is the dominating one
while his weak white roommate sit in fear of him
and eventually move out .
this movie was just terrible
and the ending made me actually laugh out loud .
the overly long slow-motion between epps and bank gets hilarious with the faces
they make
-- it is like watching my nephew and cousin making faces at each other
(
and they are all under 5 ) .
do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest .
