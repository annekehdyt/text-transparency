dave
( devon sawa )
and his friend sam
( jason segel )
and jeff
( michael maronna )
have scammed their way through college .
when creepy ethan
( jason schwartzman )
discovers their secret ,
he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful 
good-hearted student angela
( jame king )
.stupid and incompetent `` comedy '' - a lot more groan-inducing than laugh-inducing .
movie try appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gag -
but none of them work .
what is more ,
it is full of worthless 
unappealing character - and schwartzman 's character is so repulsive
he is a major turn-off .
movie even try using 50's/60 's sexpot/actress mamie van doren in the movie 's most outrageous scene .
yuck ! !
! further inging it down are its utter predictability and the waste
( yet again )
of veteran comedic actor joe flaherty 's talent -
when 's this guy going to stop accepting every role
that comes along
and do something worthwhile ?
all in all 
the only thing i liked was jame
( a.k.a .
jaime )
king ,
who was very appealing -
and deserved better.thi gets no more than one out of ten from me .
