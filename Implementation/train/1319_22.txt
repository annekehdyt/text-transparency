the haunted world of edward d. wood 
jr. is not a particularly good documentary .
aesthetically 
it is lackluster and cheap looking ,
the person in it go off on tangent
which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive ,
but this adds to it is charm .
i say
this
because it is a documentary about an oddball
that made oddball picture
and surrounded himself with fellow oddball
and 
as such 
there is really no other way
to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfit .
there are some glimpse of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood ,
and the portrayal of both quality is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary .
overall 
it is worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general ,
but do not expect illiance here .
expect a documentary made after wood 's own heart .
