johnny weissmuller 's final film as 'king of the jungle ' 
after 16 year in the role 
tarzan and the mermaid 
is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fan .
at 44 
the ex-olympian 
one of hollywood 's most active 'party animal ' 
was long past the slim athleticism of his youth ,
and looked tired
( although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry 
tarzan and the huntress )
.not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role ;
johnny sheffield 
the quintessential 'boy ' 
had grown to manhood
( he was a strapping 17-year old ) ,
so he was written out of the script 
under the pretext of being 'away at school ' .
brenda joyce 
at 35 
was appearing in her fourth of five film as 'jane '
( she would provide the transition
when lex barker became the new tarzan 
in 1949 's tarzan 's magic fountain )
and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.produced by sol lesser 
at rko 
on a minuscule budget ,
the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor
by filming in mexico .
while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air
to what was supposedly darkest africa 
veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively 
incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story.when a young island girl
( tyrone power 's future ide 
linda christian )
is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan ,
he learns
that a local high priest
( george zucco 
one of filmdom 's most enduring villain )
had virtually enslaved the local population ,
threatening retribution from a living 'god '
if they do not do his bidding .
the girl had been chosen to become the 'god 's ' ide ,
so she fled .
faster
than you can say
'is this a dumb plot or what ?
' 
the girl is kidnapped by the priest 's henchman
and returned to the island ,
and tarzan ,
followed by jane 
colorful spanish character 'benjy '
( charmingly played by john laurenz ,
who sings several tune ) ,
and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest
( poor cheeta is left behind ) .
after a series of discovery
( the 'god ' is simply a con man in an aztec mask ,
working with the priest in milking the island 's rich pearl bed ) ,
a bit of awling action 
and comic relief and song by benjy ,
everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.remarkably 
tarzan and the mermaid features a musical score by the illiant film composer 
dimitri tiomkin ,
and is far better than what you would expect from this 'b ' movie !
while the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to weissmuller 's time in tarzan 's loincloth
( he would immediately go on to play jungle jim 
a more eloquent variation of the ape man 
in khakis ) ,
the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess
it could have been.tarzan was about to get a make over 
and become much sexier ...
