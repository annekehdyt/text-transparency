stephen king adaptation
( scripted by king himself )
in which a young family 
newcomer to rural maine 
find out about the pet cemetery close to their home .
the father
( dale midkiff )
then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery
that has power of resurrection -
only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right.below average `` horror '' picture starts out clumsy 
insulting 
and inept ,
and continues
that way for a while ,
with the absolute worst element being midkiff 's worthless performance .
it gets a little better toward the end 
with genuinely disturbing finale .
in point of fact 
the whole movie is really disturbing ,
which is why i can not completely dismiss it - at least it has something
to make it memorable .
decent supporting performance by fred gwynne 
as the wise old aged neighbor 
and brad greenquist ,
as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough
to really redeem film.king has his usual cameo as the minister.followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert
( is it any wonder
that she is had no mainstream film work since ?
)
.4/10
