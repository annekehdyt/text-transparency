whoever wrote
the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any book about lucille ball 
especially her autobiography .
i have never seen so many mistake in a biopic ,
ranging from her early year in celoron and jamestown to her later year with desi .
i could write a whole list of factual error ,
but it would go on for page .
in all 
i believe
that lucille ball is one of those inimitable person
who simply can not be portrayed by anyone other than themselves .
if i were lucie arnaz and desi 
jr. ,
i would be irate at how many mistake were made in this film .
the filmmaker tried hard ,
but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me .
