`` most of us at least inhabit two world 
the real world
where we are at the mercy of circumstance and the world within 
the unconscious 
a safe place
where we can escape ... '' with those word ,
mr .gone introduce inside the world of `` the maxx '' a fascinating world
where the fantasy and the reality are combined .
inspired in the comic book of sam kieth ,
`` the maxx `` is very faithful to the material
in what it was inspired ,
not only in the story but also in the graphic style ,
that look like the page of the comic ,
giving this show a surreal and unique appearance .
but also 
the story it is interesting and entertaining .at moment
it could turn too weird ,
but
when you got inside it ,
it is hard to get out of it .
the story and the character are wonderfully developed .
the music goes perfectly with the style of the show
and give it the proper atmosphere .
unfortunately 
like many good animated show 
this one was short -lived .
`` the maxx '' is a must see .
it 's one of my all -time favorite .
