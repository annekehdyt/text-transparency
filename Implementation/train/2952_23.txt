this movie resonated with me on two level .
as a kid i was evacuated from london
and planted on unwilling host in a country village .
while i escaped the bombing and had experience
which produced treasured memory
( for example hearing a nightingale sing one dark night for the very first time )
and enjoying a life i never could have had in london 
i missed my family
and worried about them .
tom is an old man
whose wife and child have both died
and who lives alone in a small country village.as an old man
who is now without a wife whose kid have gotten married and live far away in another province ,
i am again sometime lonely .
the boy 's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd idea
of raising a child .
since a deep affection has grown between old tom oakley and this young lad ,
tom goes in search of him
and finally rescues him from very odd and dangerous circumstance .
at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some bureaucratic ruling
it seems
that the child is going to lose someone
who has developed a loving relationship with him .
