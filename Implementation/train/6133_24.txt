despite the ( english ) title 
this seems to have little to do with devil and much more to do with a power hungry ruler
who seeks the philospher 's stone and wants gold made from lead
( and virgin 's blood ) .
jacinto molina play gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having person put to death
when he thinks
they threaten his position
or when he needs virgin for their blood .
he is basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist
that he is employed
and it is more greed and insanity
that seems to be his problem than demonic possession
( unfortunately ) .
there are part
that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown man
trying to knock each other down with big stick ,
and the film at least has a good look to it ,
but otherwise there is little about this to recommand .
little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all 
and most unusual 
for a molina/naschy film 
not really any unintentional humor .
therefore 
4/10 .
