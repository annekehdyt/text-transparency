i found this film by mistake many year ago and wondered then
( still do )
why it did not get the acclaim
it should have .
well written 
beautiful acting 
one ironic twist after another ,
and there is plausibility in what the nefarious character are attempting .
i would not recommend this film for person with short attention span ;
it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend
that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story .
