in 1987 
john hughe wrote and directed 'plane 
train and automobile ' ,
which was a hilarious and poignant comedy \u0096 the best thing
he is ever done .
ten year on he is reduced to again recycling the plot of 'home alone ' in this second sequel ,
which is not connected to the other film
but is equally uninspired and sadistic .
the four crook \u0096
that is right ,
four !
and one of them is a girl !
congratulation 
hughe 
for introducing this revolutionary change to the series !
\u0096 are electrocuted with metal chair 
ained with barbell and blinded with paint 
ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha ,
while the new kid is even less charming than culkin .
you would think
that the departure of almost all the key player from the first two film would stop hughe from fossilising the same old routine ,
but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'home alone 4 ' .
