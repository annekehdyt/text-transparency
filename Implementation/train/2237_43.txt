i do not know ...
maybe it is just
because it is an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action
( hajj )
but i just felt
the movie is so underrated .
i just can not believe
that the movie has just been voted by only 223 person so far given
that the movie was produced in 2004
and it has won many award since then.about the movie ...
it is one of those well-acted sweet movie.reda 
a french teenager due to sit for baccalaur\u00e9at ,
is asked by his devout elderly father
to take him to mecca.strange
as it may seem ( if one does not know much about islam )
the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to saudia arabia on a once-in-a-lifetime religious pilgrimage.the generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough term
( 'you may know how to read and write ,
but you know nothing about life 
'
the unnamed father to his son )
but some sort of omidic generation gap literature is avoided.bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations.the father
never speaks in french
though reda understand arabic but can only seem to answer in french .
though they encounter many person on the road :
`` there is the scary old woman
they pick up in the bosnian border on the way to belgrade 
and the talkative mustafa
( jacky nercessian ) ,
who helps them out at the border of turkey ,
the reticent and shy woman
wearing burqas on the way to damascus ''
the focus is always on the mismatched father
and son.there is not much of a conversation in the movie
which makes it enjoyable to your eye .
you see magnificent view in every city
they go.the director show you even the blue mosque and the hagia sophia
even though the movie is not relatively long.generally i do not like movie
which do not have enough dialog
and which take their power from camera subtlety
but this one was really great.despite some unanswered detail
( like reda 's unseen french girlfriend )
the movie appeal to senses.great work of art
and remember this movie is isma\u00ebl ferroukhi 's debut .
