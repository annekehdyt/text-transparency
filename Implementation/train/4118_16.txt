with all of the violence on tv and in the local news 
it is refreshing to have a show
that has no violence or adult language ,
yet is still entertaining .
my child look forward to watching with us every week .
each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judge .
we all enjoy elton brown .
we enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient 
unique vegetable and seasoning .
we play along at home
to guess
who the winner will be.it is a great hour of entertainment 
as well as informational .
best of all in our hussle 
bussle life 
it is an hour the family spends together .
