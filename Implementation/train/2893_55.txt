now i love bela lugosi 
do not get me wrong ,
he is one of the most interesting person
to ever make a movie
but he certainly did his share of clunkers.this is just another one of those.lugosi play dr.lorenz 
a doctor
who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reason.he is however doing experiment to keep his wife young and beautiful.it is revealed that she is 70-80 year old yet lugosi look to be in his mid 50 's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained.anyway these treatment or experiment involved giving ide who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead.then lugosi and some of his assistant steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it is kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state.then the stolen ide have a needle rammed somewhere in their body 
maybe the neck 
and then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosi 's wife to ing her back to youth and beauty.we never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the ide but it somehow restores his wife .apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosi 's wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state.helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie ... .a weird old hag and her two deformed son ... .one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing ide and the other son is a mean little dwarf ... .little person 
to be politically correct in today 's world.at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosi 's dreary downstair lab.who these 3 are and how they came to be lugosi 's scared assistant is 
like a lot of stuff in this film 
never explained.so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor
to find out where all the stolen ide are going to.she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen ide is a rare orchid
that is found on them.so
she asks around
and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby
who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid.this expert turns out to be creepy dr.lorenz.she quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors.i am
not sure
where the police were during all this
but they came in to mop up
after the reporter had done all the dirty work.it seems
that lugosi 's movie always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line
that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens.i
mean a world famous orchid expert kidnap ide
by sending them a doped up orchid
he himself
is known to have developed ?
d'oh !
and then later it is revealed
that the young lady do not even have to be ide for the procedure
to work
so why would lugosi keep kidnapping ide from heavily guarded church for his experiment
and create all the attention and newspaper headline ?
why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do ?
this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker 
'' the devil bat '' ... .same silly plot line and bad acting and same silly 'reporter gets bad guy ' deal.but lugosi is always good
-- he is creepy and sinister enough
to keep you interested at least enough
to keep watching him.the woman
playing the reporter was just a terrible actor ... .she had no emotion whatsoever 
she just delivered her line like a machine gun 
spewing them out as quickly as she could.everyone else pretty much blew too 
when it came to being good actors.but this thing is watchable 
if only for bela lugosi fan.lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog.he must have known he was doing terrible picture but maybe he also knew
that
if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plot and bad acting
which surrounded him.and
he was right
-- --
we horror fan will always have a love for bela lugosi.he
gave
it his all every time
he was in front of the camera.we
do give two f**ks for you 
bela .
