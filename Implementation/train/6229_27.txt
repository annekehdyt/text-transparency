i often feel like scrooge 
slamming movie
that other are raving about - or ,
i write the review to balance unwarranted rave .
i found this movie almost unwatchable ,
and 
unusual for me 
was fast-forwarding not only through dull 
clich\u00e9d dialog but even dull 
clich\u00e9d musical number .
whatever originality exists in this film
-- unusual domestic
setting for a musical 
lot of fantasy 
some animation --
is more than offset by a script
that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development .
individually 
june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice person ,
but can not carry a movie as a team .
neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal .
they are both bland .
i like billy gray ,
but his character is pretty one-note .
the best part of the film 
to me 
are june haver 's beautiful costume and great body .
