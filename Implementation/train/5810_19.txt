horrible acting 
horrible cast and cheap prop .
would 've been a lot better
if was set as an action parody style movie .
what a waste .
starting from the name of the movie .
`` the enemy ''
naming it `` action movie ''
would 've made it better .
( contributing to the parody effect ) .
the cop looking like a 60 year old player ,
the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all time .
towards the end of the movie him and her are working together
to take down the bad guy and every time
they exchange word
it just feel
like the cheap line given before a sex scene in a porn movie .
horrible .
do not waste your time .
