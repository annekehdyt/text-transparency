i saw an interview with rob schneider
( who plays the lead character 
marvin mange 
in this film . )
he said
in it
that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here
so much that
even if you had the volume
turned off you
would be laughing at this movie .
obviously that must be the secret .
i had the volume
turned up .
i was actually listening to this thing
and thought
it was a disaster ,
and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after schneider 's hilarious performance in `` deuce bigalow 
male gigolo .
`` the story is stupid :
mange is a major loser
who dreams of being a cop
who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplant after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately
named dr. wilder
( michael caton ) ,
and as a result starts to lose control of his `` animal instinct . ''
this makes him a `` supercop . ''
he can sniff out drug hidden in body cavity and outrun horse .
of course 
he also has a nasty habit of eating person 's cow
and trying to seduce their goat ,
but surely that is a small price
to pay ?
it just did not do anything for me .
the cast left much to be desired .
is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley ?
here 
he plays sgt .
sisk 
mange 's commander on the police force 
as a repugnantly cartoonish character
( much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series `` scrubs . '' )
i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell 's first `` serious '' acting job
( can anything in this movie be called `` serious ? '' )
she 
of course 
gained her fame as a contestant on the first `` survivor ''
and she proves here
what we knew from that :
she is cute as a button .
what she does not prove
here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress .
and what is with ed asner as police chief wilson .
i mean ,
how old is this guy now ?
he is the size of some of the cow mange
tried to eat ,
and he seemed out of eath the whole way through .
i am surprised
he made it through the filming .
there is a ief cameo at the end by adam sandler
( who also served as executive producer of this .
) anyway 
i chuckled twice :
mange playing with his squeaky toy in the police car ,
and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan -
the orangutan has more acting talent !
so 
for two chuckle - 2/10 .
