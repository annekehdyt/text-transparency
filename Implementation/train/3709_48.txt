standard `` paint-by-numbers '' monster fare 
filled with a bunch of routine plot device from big-creature movie .
it is like somebody had a deck of card with plot idea from other movie
written on them ,
which were shuffled ,
and dealt .
whatever plot line and character came up in the deal
were then tossed into the script .
character are so clich\u00e9-ridden ,
that you can play a game of `` guess
who ends up as a monster meal '' after less than ten minute into the movie ,
and probably get every single one right
-- including the order
that they will get devoured .
many of the character are so obnoxious ,
that you root for the creature
to shut them up .
some of the main character include :
a billy idol clone
who surfs with shark 
a loudmouth at
who flashes bankroll 
a capt .
ahab guy with a vendetta 
and ahab 's girlfriend
who does sleazy dance at a bar .
oh 
and a big 
big beast in need of anger management therapy.along the way ,
person argue a lot ,
pretty girls run around with wet t-shirt ,
couple make out on exotic beach ,
explosion occur ,
ruin of a shrine appear ,
and greasy-faced pirate drop by .
amusing 
for the most part 
but one thing bothered me :
the callousness by character
when other person were killed .
after one violent demise 
they make one-liner joke .
i could almost hear rim shots.overall 
ok ,
if you have 90 minute to waste ,
and you want to laugh at a so-bad-it is-good-movie .
otherwise 
you may want to skip this one .
