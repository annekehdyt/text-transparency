since educating rita 
julie walter has been one of my role model 
and her performance in this as a woman
who helps the man
she loves get in synch with his feminine side
is magnificent .
i would never have believed her character in the hand of a lesser actress ,
but walter pulls it off with gusto and panache .
adrian pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead .
