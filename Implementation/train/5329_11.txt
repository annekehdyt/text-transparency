how many time do we have to see bad horror movie with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask ?
the plot of bleed is kinda original
but the movie itself is a complete failure .
for one thing
the dialogue is poorly developed ,
it is boring
and wastes too much time on trivial detail ,
the acting is bad 
et cetera .
i want my money back ,
this rental stink worse than a skunk .
