after leaving tv 's popular `` the andy griffith show '' ,
don knott gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matin\u00e9e-pleasing comedy vehicle .
unfortunately 
`` the reluctant astronaut '' 
filmed on the cheap
( as were most of knott ' movie ) ,
is much worse than his other .
don plays a small town schnook
who gets accepted to astronaut training camp ...
but not as a candidate for space travel
-- they want him as their new janitor !
some may say
the weak satire capitalize on american ' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology ,
but the flick is really just a dim excuse
to keep restless child occupied .
it gets off to a good start 
with an ok set-up and nostalgic location ,
but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic .
