`` i went to the movie ,
to see 'beat street ' /
it was not bad ,
it was kinda ' neat / 'krush groove ' was a flick ,
that i did not mind /
but when it came to 'rappin ' ,
i drew the line . ''
word to your mother.want me to stop ?
that is just a small sample of the stupa-fly style of rhymin ' on display in this waste of film and location permit .
this movie is seriously wack
( thats 80s-speak for just f*cking awful ) .
as an emcee 
mario van peeble is one hell of an actor .
and as an actor 
mario van peeble is one hell of a bodybuilder.any film
calling itself `` rappin ' '' had better deliver at that genre 's highest standard of the time .
so why were 6 year old rolling in the aisle 
even back in the day
when standard were so knee-high-to- '' webster '' -low ?
because this rap is weak .
so weak that not even b.e.t .
or comedy central will touch
it with a 10-foot gold-rope chain.blondie 's `` rapture '' is def poetry next to this bit of dr. suess in the hood .
so do not be a boobie ,
avoid this movie !
