the film is a bit tedious .
it is mostly a silent film ,
with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice-over .
while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea ,
this is one of those film
where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scene make it simply tedious .
you do not understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture ,
and by then it is too late .
the first 40 minute of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn 
and unimaginative soft porn at that .
later in the film the style of the first 40 minute starts to makes sense ,
but it is too late ,
because by then the audience is lost .
there is some nice location
shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico .
i have often wondered why more film are not shot there .
the campus is built on the edge of lava field
that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel .
my biggest problem with the film is that the director/writer has made the film the way
he wanted to see it
without regard
for how a viewer
who does not know
the story will view it .
you can not ignore the audience
when you tell a story .
