just the fact
that the cover is a drawing ,
like those old b-movie should give you a warning about the quality of this movie .
this is 
however not a b-movie .
it is a d-movie !
there are no
known actor ,
and the animal - wow -
it is the worst data-animation ever
made during the last two decade .
you hardly ever see the scaaary saetooth shown on the front cover .
you just hear person scream 
bleed and die
and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger-paw .
it is so amateur !
maybee worth seeing ,
just because it is so bad .
give it to a friend and say :
`` this is the best movie i
have ever seen ,
and wait for their reaction '' he 
he .
the movie is to weak
to give it a spoiler alert !
this is a spoiler .
