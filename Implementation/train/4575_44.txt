the literary genius of vladimir navokov is ought to the screen again
and many in the cultured world will take notice .
the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander 
an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction .
nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort
where a chess championship is being hosted .
she meets alexander
by picking up a queen piece
he drops thru his coat pocket .
a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day ,
the mother alarmed telegrams the husband .
he arrives
and questioning alexander we get these fade to the past 
ala ' godfather ii ,
where we see young alexander 
a child prodigy .
he is taken under a school teacher wing and exploits his genius for 10 yr making vast sum .
thinking alexander reached his peak ,
abandon him but becomes legend .
the old teacher return causing harm ,
trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander .
in a serious chess game
where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality 
the chess clock tick 
match time ends
to conclude the next day .
that day is nastasya 's wedding ,
the old teacher interfere and alexander is sent on a nervous eakdown .
nastasya 
holding her stomach
and looking thru her love 's coat finds his strategy for the match
and follows the move .
though the film unfortunately sways from its russian root ,
its low back cut dress are lovely ,
alexander plays his role sublimely.the director underestimated her audience ,
we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queen 
isolate the opponent king with your 3 paws and king 
sacrificing the castle for mate .
nastasya is a great match ,
but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity ,
but maybe the emotion were right on check for chess meant more to him than her .
the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor ,
the complexity of his work in image is a world event
not to be missed .
