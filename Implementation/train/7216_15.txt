as myself and my other half are big fan of trash horror
we could not resist getting out a movie
that contained both of the great we were thrilled !
however for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of freddy vs jason this is a disgrace !
the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh
if you are able to sit through it !
the acting is awful the effect ...
well i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombie faces and left out neck 
hands etc .
no story line 
weird flashback
that make no sense and terrible script !
`` you oke my tooth ! ''
from one vampire `` you oke my cigar '' was the response from the human
who looked like uncle jessie from duke crossed with santa !
