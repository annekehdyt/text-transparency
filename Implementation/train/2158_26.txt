wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie
using circa 1979 idea
of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girl .
script 
pacing 
and direction are uniformly awful .
action sequence defy belief .
character speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in film
aimed at the under 10 set ,
but also includes multiple sexual reference
involving shield ' character as well as graphic death .
the movie wants to be a comedy on some level
but is never funny 
an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid ,
and a child 's movie
but introduce pedophilium and child rape as real possibility .
it also wants to be a buddy picture 
a coming of age picture 
a ghost movie 
an indian spiritual movie 
a travelogue 
and a western .
the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist .
wanda nevada is a complete waste of time
unless you want to see a good many terrific shot of the grand canyon .
that it manages to do just fine .
