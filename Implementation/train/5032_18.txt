this one and `` her pilgrim soul '' are two of my favorite episode in this new version of twilight zone .
as i mentioned in my comment on the new series ,
there is something lacking in this new series .
maybe they emphasize too much the lesson
that has to be learned .
it is a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling 's version .
however 
this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too .
i think
the appeal is that no matter
what they do ,
the lover can never unite .
i remember
i was not surprised by the korean movie `` il mare ''
( later remade into `` the lake house '' .
i think
it is because i saw this episode first
so it ruined the impact of the later film .
