having just `` welcomed home '' my 23 yr old daughter from a year in iraq ,
camp anaconda medical support unit 
i felt compelled to get this dvd .
i wanted to hear other returning vet feeling
in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened .
regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all american
to begin the healing of our returning vet emotional void .
the paramount statement of the entire movie is `` take action '' on the problem .
incredibly emotional movie .
i would highly recommend this movie to the vet
the vet entire mature family and ask
that they follow through with a plan
to listen comfort help the returning gulf war enduring freedom vet.fast forward nearly one year later
and my daughter has seen this dvd .
took account of her emotion
and actually has made a commitment to re-up for another 6 year .
her take on her time
spent in the sand
is that she did some good .
local balad child got first rate medical treatment for various common ailment
not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator .
her look over her shoulder
at her iraq tour was .
`` we changed some heart and minds back there ''
