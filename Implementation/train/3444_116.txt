well then .
i just watched an crap-load of movie
-- all with varying degree of quality .
i was not too sure
about which one i wanted to review first .
then it hit me like a sack-a-rat :
rodentz .
warn person about rodentz .
this monstrosity stars nobody and is painfully dull to sit through .
and it is about mutant rat killing person .
yeah ... real freaking ' original .
`` food of the god 
'' or `` willard '' anyone ?
those were better than this ,
and that does not say
much ... **possible spoiler**okay here is the story :
inna laboratory the scientist and his plucky assistant are experimenting on rat
and their laboratory is in a crappy neighborhood and crappy building
and the plucky assistant 's moronic friend show up drunk
and everyone becomes food for the crazed rat
and just about everybody dy and 
oh yeah 
there is one giant rat
that looks crappy ,
but it gets killed 
the end .
there 
all in once sentence !
spoiler 
you say ?
ppfff ! !
i beg to differ !
the second we all realize
that there is a giant rat ,
we all know
it is gon na die eventually ! !
**end spoiler**here is the eakdown :
the good :
-- well 
i watched it for free ,
but for everyone else ... hmmm 
no .
there is nothing good here .
did not hurt it ,
did not help :
-- um ... well .
the gore was decent .
-- very average cinematography .
-- cg rat not as bad
as they could have been in some shot ...
the bad :
--
... and in other shot 
the cg rat were pathetically cheap-looking .
look ,
if your film has a low budget ,
maybe you should not rely on cg .
lesson to take to heart .
-- the acting is extremely poor.
-- the character are beyond uninteresting --
we have a mish-mash of clich\u00e9s
and none of them are even done that well .
-- booooooooooooring. --
been done before --
plenty of time .
-- stupid story 
just stupid. --
giant rat looks like fat man in poorly conceived bear costume --
that was kind of funny --
but not funny enough to give this film any worth. --
retarded 
unrealistic 
and boring dialog .
-- all the college student rat chow person are drinking tequila from huge plastic milk jug
-- and yet they do not appear to be drunk for anything longer than a few second .
way to stick with continuity 
guys.the ugly :
-- this film is bad .
simply terrible .
worse than you might imagine .
it is not even laughably bad like 
for instance 
`` scarecrow ''
( 2002 )
or `` house of the dead . ''
now those movie are crap
you can enjoy .
even if they do make you stupider.memorable scene :
-- the lame action-movie ending 
complete with uninjured hero and explosion .
because it did not feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity
-- but still sucked.acting :
2/10 story :
1/10 atmosphere :
2/10 cinematography :
4/10 character development :
0/10 special effects/make-up :
4/10 nudity/sexuality :
1/10
( i was tending to my son occasionally during the film ,
so i may have missed it 
but was supposedly in there ) violence/gore :
4/10 dialogue :
2/10 music : 1/10
( average for the time )
writing :
1/10 direction :
2/10cheesiness :
7/10 crappiness :
9/10overall :
1/10watch it
only if you love rat and vermin-based horror film .
wait ... check that .
do not watch it .
it is crap .
