i know ,
that is not what you expect from a film with this sort oflineage-
it is a direct descendant of the best year of our livesand the man ... film
dealing with man
who are in the hospitaldealing with tragic circumstance .
but this film is full of wonderfulsurprise and performance .
it features stellar performance fromeric stoltz and helen hunt
( including a rather risque nude scene )
and wesley snipe and william forsythe .
as emanuel levy wrotein his book cinema of outsider
( about the independent filmmovemant )
`` the waterdance is coherant 
attentive to detail 
andunsentimantal with a wicked down
to earth humor- it ' s at oncefunny and sad ,
and the entire cast is impressive . ''
i wasextraordinarily moved by this film ,
it is hard hitting yes 
but also hasvery tender momants and laugh out loud momants .
a rare gem .
