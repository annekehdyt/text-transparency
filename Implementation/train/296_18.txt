god i love this movie .
if you grew up in the 80 's and love heavy metal ,
this is the movie for you .
they really do not get much better than this .
the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack ever .
i put on the record
when it first came out
and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note .
the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie .
kid 's favorite singer dy .
kid plays record backward .
hero comes back in demonic form
and rocks the town .
what more could you ask for ?
if you have not seen it yet ,
rush out and buy it .
you will not be disappointed .
metal rule ...
