if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it .
this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series .
not much to see here .
the only reason
it holds
it self up
is the back story on freddy.the one thing
that is always great in nightmare movie
are the death scene .
but the death scene were very crappy in this .
the visual effect were great
and the acting was ok
but the back story was excellent .
basically freddy 's story comes full circle in this.i have read bad review for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaw :
1. a nightmare on elm street .
( 8/10 )
2. freddy 's dead :
the final nightmare .
( 7/10 )
3. a nightmare on elm street 4 :
the dream master .
( 7/10 )
4. a nightmare on elm street 3 :
the dream warrior .
( 7/10 )
5. a nightmare on elm street 5 :
the dream child .
( 6/10 )
6. a nightmare on elm street 2 :
freddy 's revenge .
( 3/10 )
i recommend it
if you enjoy the series .
this is were freddy is fully explained
but thats all there is .
next on my list wes cravens new nightmare .
( 7/10 )
