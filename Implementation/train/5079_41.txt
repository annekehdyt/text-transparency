... you know the rest .
if you want a good zombie movie ,
do not rent this movie .
if you want a documentary-esquire look at `` hood life ''
you are at the wrong place as well .
if you are looking for a laughable piece of film ,
this is a real winner !
the acting is as flat as a piece of paper .
the best example of this is definitely the officer
investigating the drive-by .
i can tell
that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice .
if i could hear a cardboard box talk ,
it would probably sound like this guy .
oh yea 
and the `` zombie '' did their best snake impression
which is on par with their fantastic acting overall
( note sarcasm ...
how did this not win an oscar for best make-up )
the quiroz ... ... did not do any sort of directing .
i felt
like i was watching an improvisational period piece
( the period is more like 1990 's la )
the direction is however one-uped by the worst script i
think to ever grace a movie .
i have not heard such lovely line 
like the epic one word beginning to the movie `` f**k !
`` 
since ice grill
which was another `` urban '' thriller .
this only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack !
all 3 or so song of it !
all in all 
what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled `` hood of the living dead '' ?
i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene ,
and boy it delivered and more !
i would definitely recommend this to anyone
who wants to get together with a bunch of guy and laugh at a low budget horror
( yea right ... )
movie for the night .
a memorable experience for sure !
