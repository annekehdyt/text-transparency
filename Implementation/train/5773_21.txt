opening credit :
great .
music : just right for this film .
cinematography :
sleazy to great effect.harrowing excitement in a train-wreck sort of way .
this is how out of control some life can become .
`` wonderland '' depicts drug-induced wildness
( and its consequence )
not as an aberration ,
but shows
how it really does happen in our society .
it is better than depiction of another wild group -manson's-
because all manson film ,
book etc concentrate so much on manson 's insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and randomness
that is so pervasive nowadays.if
you want to see some of the best `` method-acting '' on film 
watch kilmer in this movie .
he shows
how `` the method '' can be riveting in the right role.the filmmaker here succeed
in raising `` out-of-control '' to the level of an art form ,
not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrill .
