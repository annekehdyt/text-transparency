just kidding about the weight loss thing ;
well 
you might lose weight
you never know .
anyway 
what can i say ,
i love this film .
it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in film like stand by me and the goonie .
jake 's closet illustrates the beauty of life 's simple thing
and how often we overlook them .
the film reminds us what it is like to see the world through child 's eye and all the magic 
mystery ,
and horror they perceive .
jake 's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion
that anyone
who 's had a childhood
can both relate to and fall in love with .
watch it with friend ;
watch it with loved one ;
build a fort - wine optional .
