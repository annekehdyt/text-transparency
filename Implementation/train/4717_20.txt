the show 's echoed 'bubbling ' sound effect
used to put me to sleep .
a very soothing show .
i think
i might have slept through the part
where there was danger or peril .
i had also heard
that some set up shot for a show on sponge diver was shot in tarpon spring 
florida .
i would assume
lloyd bridge never dove there .
i only remember the show in rerun
and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting
we would make up our own underwater episode in the lake at my grandmother 's house ...
imagining the echoed bubbling sound and narrating our adventure in our head .
i thought
'flipper ' had better undersea action .
of course 
he had the advantage
of being in his natural environment .
