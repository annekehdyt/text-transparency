i watched this last night on tv
( hbo ) .
i have to admit ,
that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movie .
i loved the way
chip would be all calm one moment
and then violent the very next moment .
it was classic .
ahh yes .
the dame 
the villian 
the cigar and thuggish cop !
it has it all .
this movie delivered all the good to me .
i especially loved the way
they mixed communism into the plot 
very common for this era of movie .
very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those day .
i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre !
