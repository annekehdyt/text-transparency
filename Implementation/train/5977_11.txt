not a film
to be taken seriously ,
but a great little film nonetheless.it is definitely not just a piece of fluff .
the acting 
imo 
is excellent.one of those film
you would not go out of your way to see ,
but it ings a smile every time
it comes around on cable .
like an old friend.definitely worth seeing
if you get the chance.- - - - - - - -
