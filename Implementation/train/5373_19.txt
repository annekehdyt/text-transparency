every generation fully believes
it is living in the end time .
this has been true for thousand of year now .
and movie like this feed on this .
how did they get the great orson welle to narrate this train wreck ?
this is a documentary about the biblical prophecy of armageddon .
it tries to link the prophecy as well
as it can to what was happening in the time
it was made ,
making it obviously dated and kind of silly.the reenactment look like they are out of `` unsolved mystery ''
but without the high production value .
person should have been embarrassed to take part in this.in short ,
the movie is dated 
silly 
reactionary 
and useless .
good
if you want a good laugh ,
but not good enough to actually look for .
