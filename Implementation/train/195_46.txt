i came here for a review last night
before deciding
which tv movie to settle in front of ,
and those i found made this one look unmissable .
how misled i feel ! firstly ,
it needs to be pointed out up front
that this is very much a housewife 's daytime movie .
the performance are wooden ,
every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant ' in the way
that housewife 's daytime movie and bad soap operas always are ,
and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise
that man
( particularly soldier )
are essentially violent and incompassionate .
the whole movie is about the 'drama ' apparent in the momants
when the male character threaten to develop a second dimansion.if
that sounds tolerable
( or even enjoyable )
to you ,
then be warned .
linda hamilton 's german accent ,
while quite good ,
is painfully distracting -
as is her face 
for some reason .
the other performance are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassmant to their perpetrator 
with painfully thin and obvious characterization being the order of the day .
there are few surprise ,
but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque ' endless supply of food and drink
that miraculously appears from the hungry soldier ' knapsack ! i was not expecting action ,
but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged .
what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood ' story
that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence
of it all.watch it under the folowing circumstance :
1 :
there is nothing else on .
2 :
you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on man and win ' tv movie .
3 :
the only way
you can appreciate a true story
is
when hollywood turns it into a feature film .
4 :
you have imbibed enough nog
that your emotion are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling .
