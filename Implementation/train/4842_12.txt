i ran across this movie on the tv
and could not turn it off .
peter seller plays an unlikable fellow
who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn
( who would not ? ) .
the way
that goldie 's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today .
this movie gave me a different angle into human relation
and also i found it very funny .
peter seller role was a difficult sell ,
but i think
he pulls it off well .
