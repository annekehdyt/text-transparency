pretty poor firestarter clone
that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film .
how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourif ! government contractor do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb .
the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degree ,
and
when he is an adult ,
person in his life start spontaneously combusting .
he tries to find out why.the person completely on fire
are well done ,
but when they get to the point
that they are well done in another sense ,
they are obviously changed to dummy .
when jet of fire shoot out of character ' arm ,
it looks silly rather than alarming the way
it should .
also ridiculous is fire
that evidently travels through phone line and erupt in huge jet from the receiver 's earpiece .
how is that supposed to happen 
exactly ? something else
that struck me as silly about the movie
is when a character has vision of his late parent .
we later see the exact same shot from those vision in home movie .
