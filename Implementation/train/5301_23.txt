such a delightful movie !
very heart warming .
one can not help falling in love with the character of gigi .
he is adorable as a child
and grows into a sensitive artist .
the whole movie revolf around him .
he lives in a wonderful world \u0096
living all life \u0096 curiosity 
desire and anticipation .
there is an elder other
who tries to steal his glory
but really remains in the shadow all his life .
the father is very stereotypically italian
and so is the mother .
i wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene \u0096
and have them cry and laugh .
i also wish
that there was at least something redeeming about the elder other .
his personality seems to have been trashed entirely .
passion and ardour \u0096
that is the key to life .
and looking through the camera \u0096
focusing on small detail and savoring the delicate detail of life .
