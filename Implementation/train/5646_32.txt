this is one military drama i like a lot !
tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett .
this marine is no-nonsense ,
in your face ,
and no question asked kind of person
who gets the job done .
there you have billy zane
( `` the phantom '' and other )
who play richard miller 
a former swat form d.c. ,
works for the government and takes order only from them .
who needs a bureaucrat ?
i do not !
when these two are paired ,
spark should be flying .
and how .
however 
beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works .
when the other sniper hit ,
it is wit vs. wit 
cat vs. mouse 
gunman vs. gunman .
and when the seasoned sniper is caught ,
it is up to miller to put politic aside and save him .
who needs politic
when you a pro like beckett ,
he took order from no one but himself 
play by the rule and not the book ,
and mutual respect is ought out despite the politic .
the movie was a direct hit .
watch it .
rating 4 out of 5 star .
