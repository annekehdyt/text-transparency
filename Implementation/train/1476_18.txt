strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc
and is certainly one of their best movie i have seen.a man
who was hanged for a murder
he did not commit return as a ghost for revenge on the person
who accused him .
he uses a rope to strangle his victim and after several death ,
including the old man
who operates the ferry across the swamp ,
he disappears .
the old man 's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself
and also falls in love with one of the local man
and they decide to get married.this movie has plenty of foggy atmosphere ,
which makes it very creepy too.the cast includes rosemary la planche 
blake edward and charle middleton
( flash gordon )
as the strangler.strangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fan like myself .
excellent.rating :
3 and a half stars out of 5 .
