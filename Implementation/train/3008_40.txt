i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critic
that he has the talent 
style ,
and artistic integrity
to make film outside of the surreal aura
that he is become known for in the past decade .
as much as the film is g-rated ,
it is pure lynch in style 
pacing 
and tone .
the film move at a masterfully hypnotic pace
and is filled with scene of genuine emotion and power.the cinematography is terrific ,
as is to be expected from a lynch film ,
and the transitional montage sequence are eathtaking .
it is also very refreshing to see a film
where the character are all friendly 
kindhearted folk and not unmotivated character
that are clearly labeled
as being either `` good '' or `` evil '' .richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance
as do the rest of the cast 
most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher 
and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.with this film ,
david lynch proved to critic
that he could make a powerful moving motion picture
just like
he did in the 80 's with 'blue velvet ' and 'the elephant man ' .
critic seemed to lose faith in the past decade
after he produced such surreal film as 'twin peak :
fire walk with me ' and 'lost highway ' but with this film he showed
that there was method to fwwm and lh ,
and it looks
as if critic finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive ' ,
considering the high praise
it is received and the oscar nomination for lynch .
'straight story ' is to me one of the most moving motion
picture i have ever seen .
it is a loving story about family 
friendship 
and the kindness of stranger .
i would highly recommend it .
