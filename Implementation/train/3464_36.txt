and decide to arrange ron 's bachelor party .
but his real plan is to put ron in a compromising situation ,
get evidence and eak ron and mel up.comment :
supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic
but it is not funny at all .
it is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse
to show scan notily clad woman .
actually 
in a way 
it is almost impressive have many you can put in there ,
because they are everywhere .
unfortunately
that is also one of the sign of a movie
that can not support itself .
it simply is not good enough.it has three redeeming point though 
or actually three actor
that is worth a better script than this .
it is lead actor josh cooke
who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense .
sara foster i know
has more talent
than to do movie like this ,
and emanuelle vaugier seem to have a lot more talent
than this movie.what is suspiciously absent are good joke .
actually 
bad joke are rather scarce too .
it just is not funny.3/10
