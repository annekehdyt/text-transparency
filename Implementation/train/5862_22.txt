i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville 
kentucky
when i was a boy .
the scene
where dr. carmus finds the gardener 's coffin ,
and the eathing dead body therein 
was the scariest part of the movie for me 
only intensified by the darkness of the film .
i also wondered about the person hanging from the tree at the end ,
until i recognized the part of the film
in which the family name of the blackwood was changed from blackblood 
due to the fact
that in the family history there was a character
who was known for his many hanging of various person .
sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kick out of adding to the death
caused by his family .
i also noticed
that
as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery ,
he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate ,
where he meets his end .
i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lover .
