i am not a big fan of rom/com at the best of time .
a few have been quite good
( check of dream for an insomniac ) ,
but this one is just more of the same but less.with a running time of 100min ,
i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins .
the only real belly laugh are
when male stranger and friend instinctivly help out lee 's character.all i can say
is avoid .
i gaurentee there is at least 10 other movie on the shelf
that deserve you $ $ 3 of out 10
( and only cos i am a big lee fan )
