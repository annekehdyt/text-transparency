i am not sure
what dragged me into the cinema
to watch this movie ,
but few minute
after it started ,
i wanted to leave the theater .
for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me ,
but then realized
it is a waste of time ,
there was just nothing there .
i stayed
only because i had another show after it.design :
some design where quite beautiful 
mostly of the environment ,
but the character were terrible both in term of animation and design .
they look great while still - on poster and screenshot ,
but not when they have to come to life !
they just did not work ,
mostly because the very same mistake most 3d company make :
technically it is very hard
to create really natural material in 3d ,
that would make you feel
that the character is alive .
you need a lot of effort and knowledge
( hence money )
to create something
that really feels like hair 
skin 
faic 
etc .
those character in the movie were made out of `` cloth '' ,
and that just did not work !
so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality ,
where the cloth stretch or squeeze like a piece of plastic .
it just did not have the feel of a material ,
that doll are made of
( that is what those character meant to be ) .
i think
it was a big mistake choosing this style for the character .
it just had a feeling of a 3d shoot'n'run computer game .
i do not want to go to cinema
to have a computer game on my screen ,
do not know
about you ... animation was also a disgrace .
i am a professional animator
and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in `` 9 '' .
it was stiff 
boring ,
almost lacked any imagination or mood .
it was just a little bit above most average 3d animation i saw ,
and that does not add to it any good ... and all
that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story 
right ? !
that was not the case here .
actually the story was the worst thing in that movie .
it was below any level .
it starts straight forward ,
it goes straight forward
and it ends the same .
there is no twist 
no surprise 
no good dialog 
even no development .
we have heard
and saw story of machine overtaking the humankind thousand of time and `` 9 '' is just one of them ,
and we know
how it ends at the very first minute of that movie .
the character do not even have time
to get into the story -
they are just there ,
showing themselves almost immediately ,
and immediately some of them take action
without even getting to know what is going on .
it just did not work .
there are also many repetitive action sequence ,
that looked
as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story ... acting 
sound and script - oh my gosh ,
what can i tell ,
it was pathetic .
bad story has a bad script ,
and except dialog like `` no 
do not do it ! ''
`` i will do it ! ''
`` but ... you can not do it alone ! ''
`` we can do it together ! ''
`` but there are rule ! ''
`` but we have to save him ! ''
etc etc and so on ,
and repeating itself all the time ,
so besides those terribly pathetic dialog ,
there were those non stop `` ahh '' and `` ohhh '' and '' ehh '' 
and `` oooh '' 
and `` whatchout '' 
and `` run ! ''
and `` ohohh ! ''
that were following almost every jump 
run 
or fall of the character and it even sounded
as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed.conclusion :
bad acting 
bad animation 
bad sound 
bad story 
bad script 
bad character ,
everything expected 
no surprise 
no twist 
nothing .
only some good design are not worth the time .
big no !
