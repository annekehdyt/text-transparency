the potential was there .
i saw creep
and thought 
'oooh 
this is getting interesting ' several time .
yet somehow the interesting plot line wound up unexplained or ignored ,
like they never happened .
the lead character was irritating throughout the movie 
and at one point my fella and i both shouted
that we wanted her to die .
there are some genuinely spooky/scary moment ,
but these are grossly overshadowed by the moment
that just annoyed the hell out of me .
it is another one of those horror movie
that crops up and intrigue you for a while ,
but ultimately leaves you frustrated
and a little confused about what the movie maker were trying to achieve.the one saving grace of this movie
is the bad guy ,
but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character
you know
you are on to a loser .
