as a big fan of the original film 
it is hard to watch this show .
the garish set decor and harshly lighted set rob any style from this remake .
the mood is never there .
instead 
it has the look and feel of so many television movie of the seventy .
crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff ,
but his snappy wardrobe and `` swank '' apartment do not fit the mood of the original ,
or make him an interesting character.he does his best to make it work
but samantha egger is a really bad choice .
the english accent and california look can not hold a candle to barbara stanwick 's velvet voice and sex appeal .
lee j.cobb try mightily to fashion barton keye ,
but even his performance is just gruff ,
without style.it feel like the tv movie
it was and again remind me of what a remarkable film the original still is .
