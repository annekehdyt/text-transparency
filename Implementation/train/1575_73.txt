only the glandular secretion
-- and please do not ask for any more detail --
of young virgin can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist 's wife fresh and youthful .
since 
like most person
except those
taking part in medical trial ,
virgin seldom give up their secretion willingly 
dr. lorenz
( bela lugosi )
arranges for them to be abducted and preserved .
he will do the extracting himself .
what a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie .
if the corpse vanish turns out not to be the havarti of horror 
as a plain limburger
it leaves an interesting aftertaste .
sure 
the acting is almost awful except for the actor fortunate enough
to be playing the crazed dwarf
( angelo rossitto ,
who later played the master in mad max beyond thunderdome ) ;
his crazed ute of a other 
angel
( frank moran ) ,
who grunts a lot
and has a fetish for the virgin ' hair ;
the crazed mother of the two
( minerva urecal ) ;
the crazed wife
( elizabeth russell ) ,
who sleeps in a plush coffin and 
of course 
the crazed doctor
( lugosi ) .
an enterprising young reporter 
patricia hunter
( luana walter )
tracks down the doctor
because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor
that had been worn by the victim .
when the doctor and his wife invite pat to stay the night ,
a raging storm immediately eaks out .
that clue tells us
some raging violence is about to erupt inside .
since it is well known that in hollywood at this time all unmarried young woman were virgin ,
pat may have some unpleasant surprise to deal with .
they include dark passage 
a crusty laboratory
where a near dead virgin is stored 
a basement mausoleum and 
later 
a direct threat to patricia 's own glandular secretion .
if she survives ,
what a story she will
have to give her editor .
if you sample this moist slice of moldy velveeta
( and why not ?
do not be superior ) ,
do not judge bela lugosi by the company
he keeps here .
he had a huge impact in dracula
( 1931 ) ,
but my favorite movie of his is the black cat
( 1934 ) .
as dr. vita werdegast
he is a sad 
ironic man protective of his two young friend .
when he finally takes a scalpel to hjalmar poelzig
( boris karloff )
and begins to flay the man alive 
ah 
well ,
it is a great scene .
