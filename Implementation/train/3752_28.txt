loosely intended as a satire of d.w. griffith 's intolerance ,
the three age was buster keaton 's first attempt at a full length comedy feature .
the only similarity to intolerance are the opening `` book '' scene and the fact
that similar story through the age are edited
together into a complete film .
keaton 's reasoning for appropriating this style was that
if it did not succeed as a feature film ,
it could be reduced to three two-reeler .
fortunately 
the three age succeeds illiantly as a comedy
and contains some of the funniest routine i have seen in any of keaton 's film .
there is nothing unique or daring about the story line .
they are simple boy-meets-girl 
boy-loses-girl 
boy-gets-girl plot ,
but the period satire are riotous
and set the standard for future work by mel brook and all film of this genre .
however 
i do not believe
that anyone has ever topped this comedy .
no one can play the lovable goof
like keaton and the stunt in this film are some of his best .
in addition 
wallace beery 's appearance as keaton 's rival adds to this film 's appeal .
anyone
who thinks
that comedy from the 1920 's can not be appreciated by modern audience needs
to see this movie .
