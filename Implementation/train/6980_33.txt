this show comes up with interesting location as fast as the travel channel .
it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera .
it is try to use exotic locale as a facade to ing person into a phony contest
and then proceed to hook viewer on the contestant soap opera style.it
also borrows from an early cbs game
show pioneer- beat the clock-
by inventing situation for its contestant
to try and overcome .
then it rewards the winner money .
if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the character 
even better .
while the game format is in slow motion
versus beat the clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality .
this show has element of several type of successful past program .
reality television 
hardly ,
but if your hooked on the contestant 
locale or contest ,
this is your cup of tea .
if your not ,
this entire series is as i say 
drivel dripping with gravy .
it is another show hiding behind the reality label
which is the trend
it started in 2000.it
is slick and well produced ,
so it might last a while yet .
after all 
so do re-run of gilligan 's island 
green acre 
the beverly hillbilly and the brady bunch .
this just does not employ professional actor .
the intelligence level is about the same .
