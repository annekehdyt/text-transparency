ok 
i have seen plenty of movie dealing with witch and the occult
but this one was just plain weird .
this movie starts out as this cult of witch
led by a really bad orson well
playing the staring role
( could not they have gotten somebody
that looked and acted more like a satanist )
he just did not belong in this movie at all .
but anyhow 
the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll
that resembles somebody
and makes her
have a miscarrage .
the lady
that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place
called lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever
it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there
and to never use her power there
or she will die .
the couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover
that all the inhabitant are all witch
and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbor and friend .
then strange thing start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill
that suddenly disapears
( that was creepy )
as well as seeing the little boy
belonging to orson well at the playgroud
that
he later asks the lady to help him ing back to life .
the lady soon tries to escape the town
but only to find herself traped
by it is inhabitant and power
and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about .
this movie is ok ,
it is has it is moment of suspense
but it really could have done much better than to have orson in there .
