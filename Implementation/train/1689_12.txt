interesting mix of comment
that it would be hard to add anything constructive to .
however 
i will try .
this was a very good action film with some great set piece .
you will note i specified the genre .
i did not snipe about the lack of characterisation ,
and i did not berate the acting .
enjoy if for what it is person 
a well above average action film .
i could go on
but i have made my comment .
