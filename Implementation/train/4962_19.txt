this series adds new information
and background to the book and includes personal appearance by the author and by archaeologist and other anthropologist .
it ings the book to life
and makes even more sense of the author 's subsequent opus ,
*collapse*.diamond himself comes off as personable and caring ,
not just a disinterested or disengaged academic .
this series makes it clear
that his book was not just a response to a need to `` publish or perish 
''
as the saying goes about academe ,
but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects ,
`` why you white person got so much cargo ,
and we have so little ? ''
because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community ,
diamond looked for an answer
that did not insult that intelligence or that community .
i like to think of his answer in a very simple way 
in the same spirit as `` south park 's '' `` blame canada '' :
`` blame wheat ! ''
