i remember that show .
i still remember that kick ass fun song `` america 's funniest person . ''
frankly it should have been titled american 's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting person .
dave could not save this show
and neither could bob saget or the replacement host for afv
that came later .
the jackalope segment were hilarious
and yes dave could make some good voice
over that were better than bob 's .
but this show went to hell
because of the lame crappy video person submitted .
also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest star
including the olson twin .
plus afv was in it is prime
before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin baby as the winner .
did i mentioned
the video were disgusting and lame ?
but still the theme song rock !
