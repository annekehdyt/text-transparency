i wanted to like this film ,
i really did .
it is got some good actor
but ultimately it falls flat .
it tries too hard to be funny in some place
( the daughter over zealous cooking attempt ) ,
over reach in other
( the scene
where they clean up someone 's yard ,
so he agrees to join the team )
and has some scene
that ,
while mildly interesting ,
are really just filler
( all the work scene 's ) .
and i did not find the `` villian '' intimidating 
or worth hating ,
so much as i found them to be childishly annoying .
i have met person like those in the film
while playing church ball .
and i will say
the referee 's are spot on ,
still 
in the end 
i really did not care all
that much about the character 
or their quest for church ball glory .
maybe
because they were all so one dimensional ,
which i might not have minded so much
if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall .
kurt hale 
and halestorm entertainment 
has made some good film ,
but this is not one of them .
