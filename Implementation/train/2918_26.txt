i rated this movie as awful
( 1 ) .
after watching the trailer ,
i thought
this movie could be pretty cool .
`` guaranteed to offend ... everyone ! ''
the trailer said .
well ... it did offend me ,
because this movie really sucks .
it is hardly a comedy ,
as i laughed about two second during the entire movie .
and what is with all the gay in this movie ?
i am not gay and i do not have a problem with those
who are ,
but what is the point
of adding so many gay-scene in a so
called comedy movie ,
when these scene are absolutely not funny ?
i guess
the director is a gay man in denial 
or something like that.so my advice to you is :
if you want to waste good money ,
go rent a good comedy
you have already seen a million time ,
you will be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy 's .
it really is total crap .
