i can not believe
that in the 34 prior comment 
nobody mentioned
that this film is a blatant rip-off of born yesterday .
a man is hired
to ing an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirement of a gangster .
hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after .
gangster is left in the lurch .
but born yesterday was an intelligent treatment
whereas this is just so much fluff .
technicolor transfer to dvd is deplorable .
natalie kalmus would be rolling over in her grave .
check out the paperboy .
recognize him ?
but 
it is historically interesting to see the root of rock 'n roll .
also interesting is ewell 's introduction to cinemascope 
a new format at the time .
