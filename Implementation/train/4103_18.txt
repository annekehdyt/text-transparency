now here is a film straight out of my childhood ,
my family used to taped ;
but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the year .
now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com ;
i had love this wonderful film
when i watched it as kid ,
and after watching again
( online ) ,
i still do today .
my favorite song from the movie is `` candy heart and paper flower ''
( i will always remember that sweet song forever ) .
i was surprised
when i looked at the opening credit
( on who animated
who ) ,
that some of the animator date back to 1930s
( wow !
that is like 47 year ) .
