do not believe all of the negative review this movie receives .
yes 
it is cheaply made .
yes 
the gore is laughable .
and 
yes 
the acting is sub-par .
however 
this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick ,
and
if that is your `` thing ''
( its mine ! )
then you will enjoy this one .
there are enough good aspect to this movie to more than compensate for the drawback .
for one 
the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly .
the ending is a welcomed eak from the predictable upbeat
ending of most movie .
and last 
but not least 
the setting is what made the film for me .
the maker of this film could have done a much better job `` dressing '' the set
to make it more believable as a college dorm .
however ,
if you can overlook this flaw ,
the setting is great .
four collegiates all alone in a huge 
abandoned ,
condemned building just waiting to be torn down ... .
it reaks of possibility .
when watching ,
allow your imagination to do some of the work
and you may enjoy this film as much as i did .
