tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei ' 
a novel
that was put on the screen twice
( 'spoorloos ' and 'the vanishing ' ) .
one of the dutch writer 's more recent works is 'de grot ' 
a psychological thriller about two totally different man 
egon and axel ,
who meet at a youth camp and 
surprising enough 
become friend for dear life .
egon is a quiet 
somewhat dull person ,
who spends his time studying
and writing geography book .
axel 
on the other hand 
is a charismatic 'party-animal ' 
a heavy drinking criminal
whose everyday 's concern
is to get a woman into his bedroom .
from the momant they meet ,
axel has a strong influence on egon ,
while the latter envy him
because he has a good life
without really doing anything
( such as reading thick book like egon ) ;
ultimately 
egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practice himself ,
which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country.after
having read the book last year ,
i was surprised
the critic were quite positive about it .
in my opinion 
the book suffer especially from the complex structure .
while krabbe present the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two person ,
the plot becomes more of a puzzle :
the many episode are not presented chronologically ,
so that two successive scene are seldom in the same episode .
because of this ,
the story feel surprisingly remote :
you often need to know a character 's background
to really care for him or her .
another complaint was the fact
that the main character 
egon and axel 
are a little stereotypical .
egon is 'the ' dull intellectual ,
while axel is his exact opposite .
in real life 
such one-dimansional person rarely exist ;
in book and film 
they always seem to be there ,
taking away a lot of credibility.despite all this ,
the film was a pleasant surprise ,
being much better than the book .
the adaptation excel in its beautiful cinematography 
humour and acting :
fedja van huet
( egon )
is one of the few dutch actor
who can make you forget
he is acting
( which is 
in my opinion 
the highest an actor can achieve ) .
the drawback of the film 
however 
are the same as the book 's :
mainly
because the character are one-dimansional ,
they are so predictable
that it becomes annoying .
guess who wrote the script ?
indeed 
krabbe himself .
it is obvious that this talented director
( that is what the movie makes clear anyway )
is hampered by a deficient screenplay .
perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.7/10
