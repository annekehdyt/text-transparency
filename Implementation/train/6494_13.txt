i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival ,
and there was not a dry eye in the house .
it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is ,
but how admirable the rest of the team is too
and at such a young age.it also made me think
how disgusting mtv was ,
and how on being given an opportunity
to involve and inspire in a positive way ,
they declined .
show you
whether they really care about the youth
and their viewer at all.it is a wonderful and heart warming true story ... take your tissue
but it is great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be .
