this movie was promising :
my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war .
it had memory from `` dance with wolf '' for the big prairy 
indian 
military fight and from `` barry lyndon '' for the british and candle light atmosphere ... unfortunately ,
the script is awful :
the continuity of the story is lacking
( cut with `` 5 month later '' ;
`` 3 year later '' )
and the romance is so ridiculous
that it is hard to believe in it :
america is a big country
but the character kept bumping at each other ;
above all 
wait for the ending
and you understand how to kill a story
( imagine the same in `` titanic '' )
.sometimes 
a bad script is saved by a illiant filmmaker .
unfortunately bis 
hudson is a poor one .
he has already committed `` greystoke ''
and i find again the same flaw :
no dynamic in scene 
in editing 
in scoring :
it is long 
dull 
flat ...
.i knew
that this movie was a disaster for pacino 's career :
now i understand .
finally 
this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me :
a painful one ...
