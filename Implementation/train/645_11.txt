image are great
and reflect well the landscape of canada .
the story was 
on the other side 
quite boring ;
to my eye it was a love story in the wood
just like titanic was a love story on a boat .
i did not feel
that grey owl was great environmentalist .
i usually like lord attenborough
but this one was ... bad .
