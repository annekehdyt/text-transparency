put quite simply 
this film is terrifying.it start off simply ,
looking like a study of a rebellious young girl
and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film.do
not expect gore 
or zombie .
this is psychological ,
and just as he would also do in candyman ,
bernard rose manage to convey the horror
that is not being believed.each time
you watch this film ,
you realise more about what is happening ,
and about how the two world in this film interconnect.drawing have never been scarier .
