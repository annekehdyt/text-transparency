no real plot to this one ,
just a series of short skit acting out some very old joke .
i chuckled once or twice in the beginning 
much to my chagrin .
but even at only 73 minute this film wears out
it is welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious
( with some nudity sprinkled in here
and there to keep you awake ) .
still as bad
as this movie is ( and that is pretty putrid ) ,
it is a comedic gem
compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer and jason friedberg
( date movie 
epic movie 
meet the spartan )
also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.eye candy :
