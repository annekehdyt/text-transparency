oliver gruner is totally unknown to me .
my friend showed me this film
because he had seen gruner in ,
what he called a pretty good sci-fi film 
nemesis .
so as we watched this ,
we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama part just to get to the unbelievable action sequence .
gruner loves to kick and kick and kick .
and kick !
hahagruner character is a graduate student
who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one
that he grew up in .
he finds himself watching
after the boy who lives with him
because he really wants to join in the mexican gang
that keeps tormenting his family .
instead of joining up ,
gruner tells the boy to fight back
( against a gang ?
too crazy ) .
gruner plays a typical van damme character
who kills everyone
( or maims them pretty bad )
and works
to rid his block of these gangmembers.the plot
was very cheesy and easy to think of .
gruner is probably not very well
known because of his script-choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choice to .
this ghetto is pure hell
and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of character go through it
as if they have a chance against gruner 's character .
the music was typical action music
( thumping piano and timpani 
swelling guitar )
which actually was not as bad
as i make it sound .
the director really needed to keep the action
going instead of taking a eak every 5 minute for a tense family moment.ultimately ,
i gave it a 4/10
because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in ,
but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw .
