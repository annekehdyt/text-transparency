the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller
( looking surprisingly aged a year after `` tarzan and the huntress '' )
is bad ,
in spite of all the trivia one can add
to make it look better .
it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller ,
shooting in beautiful scenery in m\u00e9xico 
with a top star of that country
( andrea palma )
and multiple award-winning cinematographer gaiel figueroa 
and inging in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score .
although it may have cost less for filming aoad ,
it look more expensive than any other rko film in the series ,
taking advantage of acapulco beach and real pyramid as aquatania 
and with impressive d\u00e9cor for all the scene
related to the temple of god balu
( especially the exterior ,
built on steep rock . )
kurt neumann should have stayed as director 
instead of robert florey ,
who gives it a very slow pace .
neumann had done a fine work with `` tarzan and the amazon '' 
`` tarzan and the leopard woman '' and `` tarzan and the huntress '' ,
and finished his career directing the classic `` the fly '' the year before his death ;
while florey became a television director 
after a career of few remarkable film .
if weissmuller look tired ,
the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the other ,
but the worst character is benji 
an obnoxious mailman
who sings horrendous song
( that have a caribbean air ,
in a location supposed to be africa and shot in m\u00e9xico ! )
boring and decidedly of dubious taste ,
it was a sad farewell to weissmuller 's tarzan .
