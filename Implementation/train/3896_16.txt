i tried to finish this film three time ,
but it is god awful .
case in point :
mom and daughter drive up to the bed and eakfast ,
mom stop for gas 
crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby
whose running the bandb try to rape her .
she escapes 
head to bandb and instead of hubby going ballistic
and she wanting to call the cop ,
story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their part .
wow.other action logic deficit abound .
acting is also lukewarm ,
and the next door neighbor 's warning is delivered in a really corny ,
badly acted moment.moment of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scene of time-filler interplay between characters.less focus on gore ,
more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated .
