do not expect much from this film .
in many way this film resembles a film
that doris day starred in in 1956 
title 
julie .
in this film doris ,
who was a flight attendant 
stewardess 
in those day ,
landed the air craft after her derange husband ,
played by louis jordan
shot the captain .
she did a far better job 
more convincing 
than kim ojah ,
who took control of a 747 and manage
to land it
without much help from the control tower .
i know a little about 747 aircraft ,
i use to be a flight attendant myself .
like i said ,
do not expect much from this film ,
it was done on a cheap budget .
the producer were to cheap
to use a plane with the name of a airline on it .
oceanic is one name
that several movie have used .
the only writing on this plane was the name of the company
that made the aircraft .
