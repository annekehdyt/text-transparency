as an ordinary movie-watcher i can not say
i enjoyed watching this one .
it is not too emotional for a drama ,
not too gripping for a thriller ,
not too fast for an action .
plus 
some moment of the movie are hardly credible .
ok 
i understand 
soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there ,
but it is hard to believe
that a person would risk his life 
carjack into the middle of a hostile city ,
and after being shouted at by a professor 's wife run away ,
without having asked a question
( in a proper way ) .
it would seem terribly romantic
if it were an animation or so ,
but it is supposed to be a serious film about war.. there are several episode like this ,
so the whole picture makes an impression
that it is just a raw preview of a movie ,
and it needs considerable work.it feel
like the movie maker wanted to create an image of an emotional ave soldier ,
but all these 'curf ' of his psychology seem simply unnatural.this picture left a question in my head :
why ?
why they gave it an oscar ?
why six ?
and imho it is the most thrilling part of the movie : )
