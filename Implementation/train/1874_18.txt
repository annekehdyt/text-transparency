`` the kennel murder case '' starts off at a run
and does not stop until the very end .
everybody had reason
to kill the victim ,
and several person tried .
william powell is terrific as philo vance 
gentleman detective .
mary astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece
who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman
and enjoy her inheritance .
this movie comes paired with `` nancy drew 
reporter '' on dvd ,
which is also fun .
if you have to rent the disc
( or check
it out from your local liary ) ,
do it .
it is pure entertainment !
