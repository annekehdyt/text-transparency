carman is one of the best film i
have ever seen .
it is hard to say
whose performance is best :
antonio gade 
cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb.they dance their soul out .
it is a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth ;
myth penetrate everyday life .
dance becomes life
and entire life is danced out .
real person at one and the same time live their own life
and become somebody else ,
act out the part of lover of old .
the magic is continuing .
