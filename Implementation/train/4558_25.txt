the odd couple
( 3+ outta 5 star )
like most person i will always feel
that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive `` odd couple '' .
their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid-70 was a highwater mark for television at the time ...
easily surpassing the stage and screen version of the tale .
nonetheless 
how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon/walter matthau pairing ?
matthau is in especially good form as oscar 
the slob .
lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix ,
particularly if you have previously seen tony randall 's outstanding performance .
the script is good ... definitely neil simon 's best .
( i will go on record here
as stating
that neil simon is probably one of the worst 
most over-rated playwright of american theatre . )
the storyline is simple :
felix 
a neat freak and newly separated from his wife move in with oscar 
the slob
who needs some help saving money for alimony payment .
their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well 
culminating in some amusing tiff and spat .
lot of fun and some great one-liner .
