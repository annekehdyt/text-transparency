if you did not live in the 90 's or did not listen to rapper ever ! !
this movie might be ok for you 
but any for any fan or any single person
who ever listened to rap this movie
was boring
and there was no point in the movie
where i said
that interesting or i did not know that .
another thing
that bugged me was it made it look like anything in his life
he did was very easy there
was no struggle
he made jail look easy 
selling drug ,
and even rapping it was not realistic .
i think
if the movie
where released in about 15 year from now it
might have more of an impact maybe ! ! !
good rap movie hustle and flow 
get rich or die
trying
not notorious
