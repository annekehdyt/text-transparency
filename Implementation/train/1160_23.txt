i grew up in southern west virginia ;
i am about the same age
as ( or maybe a year older than ) homer hickam 
author of `` the rocket boys 
'' the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film.and
so i relate closely to the west virginia coal-mining theme ,
and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time
( october 4 
1957 )
on all of us .
the rocket boys went on to make great life for themselves .
i went on to get my degree in physic and computer engineering .
all
because sputnik woke up a lot of young person to the `` science gap ''
the u.s.s.r. had on the u.s. in those cold war day ...
this is a wonderful film for everyone 
of all age .
but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950 's ,
it will touch the core of your being.everyone :
get it ;
watch it ;
recommend it to your friend ...
who 'll thank you many time .
