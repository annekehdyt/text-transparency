i have seen this movie and the other one .
trinity is my name and i find
that this one is worse then the first one .
i have no idea
why they even made another movie
it was stupid and pointless sorry to say
that i have all of them .
i have sat through them number of time
and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minute into the movie .
i like terence hill movie and i like bud spencer
but this movie just drove me up the wall .
if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy
it might have been funner
and worth the 5 dollar i spent buying all the movie .
but you make mistake
so i would say save your money and do not bye this movie or any of the one
that go
with it trust me on this one .
