i wanted to see the movie
because of an article in a film magazine .
it was not a highly recommended one by the critic .
the storyline is different and i am sure
that it could have been a good movie
if it was in right hand .
directing and acting were awful ! !
i had the feeling
of watching a movie
which was made a bunch of amateur .
although the movie started promisingly ,
it got worse and worse .
i think
this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. i
still think
that it is worth watching
as i have not seen film subjecting gay porn .
do not keep your expectation high though ,
then you will be very disappointed .
* out of *****
