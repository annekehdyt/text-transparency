it is a real challenge
to make a movie about a baby
being devoured by wild canine
and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odd this one succeeds .
meryl streep gives the performance of her life 
melodramatic 
overwrought but with that comic genius
that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.if comedy about the infant
being eaten by dog
are not your cup of tea
you might be uncomfortable watching this and 
yes ,
it is an odd choice of topic for a farce
but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that
as it focuses on giving streep a showcase for her aussie accent and facial contortion .
throwing in a slam at medium bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethic gives the movie the chance
to make the daring point
that those thing are bad .
