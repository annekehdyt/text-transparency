forget neo and bourne and all those half-baked made up modern hero .
they only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geek
that want to be their hero .
since they can not be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jone 
hollywood allowed a bunch of fake
that have no beard
and yet fulfill teenager wish to see something
that looks very much like an action flick.however ,
their `` action set-piece `` are just painful to watch
and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question .
this explains the recrudecence of oldie on our silver screen over the past few year .
for better
( rocky 
rambo )
or worse
( die hard 4 -
where john mcclane 
ace yourself ... . had no beard ! !
)
i say
it is high-time a new hero
walked up
and put their reign to an end .
this `` largo winch `` movie is far from perfect ,
and perhaps too predictable at time ,
but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero .
and the only one time where he was weakened
is when m\u00e9lanie thierry shaved his beard !
i rest my case.i did not know it
when i entered the theater room ,
but this might be the movie i have been waiting for a decade .
for the first time in france since belmondo 
can a movie be both well- crafted
and rooted in b-genre
without blushing over its performance .
in the meantime all
we had to chew on
was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted
to reach a wider audience ... in other word
it was `` le pacte de loups `` or `` dobermann
`` ( i like dobermann 
mind you )
... i believe
`` largo winch `` has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.i exited the theater room very pleased 
and hungry for more .
