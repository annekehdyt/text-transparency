a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two danger .
the mystery is whether or not jane graystone
( nancy coleman )
has amnesia .
the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr. ingersoll ,
a good doctor turned evil .
he is head of a spy ring
attempting to get information from amnesiac jane 
coded information
related to allied activity .
will she tell ?
can she remember ?
moroni olson
( as mr. goodwin )
is convincing as an accomplice to massey .
the role
played by john garfield
( as dr. lewis )
is nothing short of disastrous .
he seems so badly miscast
that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history .
it is unfortunate
that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role
which not befitting his talent .
the movie is worth one look ,
despite being a half spy and half gangster film ,
and despite containing a parade of stereotyped character .
it is easy to forget this one ,
amnesia is not necessary .
