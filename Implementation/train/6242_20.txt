'the mother ' is that extraordinary piece of film
making -
it gets you thinking ,
it pulls no punch -
and ultimately it leaves you thinking .
very much open-ended as to the lead character 's fate .
anne reid
( which i only knew iefly from her appearance in some victorium wood-led project
and thought a fine comedienne )
is truly superb here .
not the stereotypical widowed housewife
that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all .
and not all that free-spirited and adventurous at first .
she plays her character just with the right note
that rings true
( well ,
it did to me ) .
powerful cast .
great script .
renaissance of european cinema indeed ; )
