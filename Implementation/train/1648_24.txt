do not see this .
this was one of the dumbest movie
i
have ever seen .
its hard to be mormon sometimes
when there are movie like this out there .
what a sad view of mormon life .
i can tell you
if you did see this movie
that it is not all like this at all in a single ward .
if it was i do not think
i would have made it through it .
its too bad
that most mormon movie are made by a group of geek
who have nothing better to do .
the acting was so bad
that my wife and i barely made it through .
i guess you could say
that it had all the sign of a b movie .
or are there c movie ?
anyway ... i just thought this movie sucked
and was full of cheese .
i wish
some mormon would start making some quality movie .
