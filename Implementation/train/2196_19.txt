i loved it ,
having been a fan of the original series ,
i have always wondered what the back story would be -
it did not fail to delight me .
i also love the fact
that apart from eric stoltz i did not recognise one person - this is refreshing 
much like bsg .
it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent -
can not wait for the series to start airing .
well done to ronald d. moore and team - excellent job .
the special effect 
dialogue and acting were all spot on ,
and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline .
i know
there are purists out there
that will probably disagree with my assessment ,
but i felt
that caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi stuff
produced in the last decade .
