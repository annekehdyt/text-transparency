this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact
that lindsey haun is lovely .
however the reason
the movie is so predictable
is that
we have seen it all before .
i have have not read the book a mother 's gift but i hope for britney and lynne spear sake
it is completely different than this movie .
unless you consider ending a movie
with what is essentially a music video an original idea ,
the entire movie ings to mind the word plagiarized .
