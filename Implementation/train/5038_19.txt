this is one of my favourite martial art movie from hong kong .
it is one of john woo 's earliest film and one of only a few traditional martial art movie
he directed .
you can see his influence from working under chang cheh in this film .
the action is good ,
the fight choreography is conducted by fong hak on
who appears as one of the bad guy in the movie .
it stars wei pei of `` five venom '' fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fan of golden harvest and shaw brother production .
the story line is interesting ,
there are a few decent plot twist
and the build up of the character
and their relationship with each other is cleverly done .
this film has only had a vhs release in the uk .
medium asium have released a region 3 dvd
and there are version of it on dvd available from the usa .
the film is lovely to watch
in either it is original language
or in it is english dubbed version .
i highly recommend this movie .
