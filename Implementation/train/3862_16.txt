i just saw the drug year on vh1 and i love it .
i think
it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly
it has a strong message to the all generation .
there is woodstock ,
there are joplin 's 
hendrix 's and jim morrison 's death ,
there are many many example of drug use and drug abuse .
it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad way .
in my opinion this documentary is well done
and i would like to congratulate to its creator
because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these day .
i am waiting for the dvd release .
you should definitely see it ! ! !
this movie is stunning
-- big time !
