as someone
who lives near buffalo 
new york 
this movie scored point with me
before i even saw it ,
since the story is based here .
there are even some bit part with real-life news-tv anchor person from buffalo..and 
for once ,
it does not knock the area .
hallelujah ! theology-wise ,
puh-leeze ! ! !
god is still made to look
and think like human ... and 
of course 
be a bit on the liberal side .
being the lightweight comedy it is ,
it is nothing
that should win any award
but it still is entertaining
and is a pleasant way
to kill 102 minute .
there are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scene and 
hopefully 
audience - from christian to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laugh ,
such as what prayer should really be all about .
kudos to the writer for at least getting
that theology correct
and giving a good message.overall ,
it is a good-hearted film
that should offend very few .
