the third installment of the `` carnosaur '' trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops-quality military commandos
trying to kill two velociraptor and a t-rex .
i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaur .
the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy ,
it really can not be taken seriously .
more significan notly 
however 
watching this movie i can not help but notice some interesting parallel between the `` carnosaur '' and `` xtro '' trilogy .
the first installment in both franchise is a dark ,
disturbing film
that has become a cult classic ,
the second is an `` alien '' ripoff ,
and the third is a tongue-in-cheek 
almost slapstick
( whether intentional or not )
movie
that has you rolling on the floor laughing .
also 
like the `` xtro '' franchise 
all the `` carnosaur '' movie are completely unrelated to one another .
they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the `` sequel 
'' i guess .
obviously `` carnosaur '' and `` xtro '' have two different production group at work here ,
but if you have seen all three movie of both franchise
you find yourself referring back and forth between the two .
