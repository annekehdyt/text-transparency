i still can not believe
how bad this movie was .
if i was not a massochist i do not know
if i would have survived the viewing .
it looks like it cost about $ 1000 to make ,
but it was not the money
that ought them down .
the acting was horrid - not just bad ,
3rd grader could have read the line better .
second 
the only other reason
to watch this kind of movie
is the skin ,
and that is sorely lacking in this flick .
we do not even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff .
ahh well 
better luck next time eh ?
