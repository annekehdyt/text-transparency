i had a lot of hope for this movie
and so watched it with a lot of expectation ;
basically because of kamal hassan .
he is an amazing actor
who has marked his foot step in the sand of time forever .
but this movie proved to be one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
after watching this the movie
the utality and violence in tenea and clockwork orange looks far better .
the protagonist 
raghavan 
is a very daring police officer .
who is assigned to a investigate utal serial murder .
raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case
and is close to solve the murder
and put the psycho killer ,
two psychologically disturbed but illiant medical student 
behind bar
but they escape
and again get into a killing spree .
finally raghavan kill them both
after sparing many innocent lives.these two psycho-killer are the one
who are going to keep the audience from going to the theater .
the murder and sexual harassment and rape are shown very explicitly ,
which the movie could have survived without .
to even imagine
that teenager and kid are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture
it is bound to paint in their mind
are certainly not pretty .
the director 
gautham 
should realize
that he also has some obligation to the society
and his audience.certainly i am never going to the movie
looking like gautham 's name on the production list .
