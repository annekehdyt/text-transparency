( spoiler included ,
some would say )
this film is not possible to take seriously .
at some part it is so awfully stupid
that i just can not help laughing at it all .
try me for the sequence
where stallone 's character jumps some 20 meter with full climbing gear
or ( and this is really my favorite ) snuffs a bad guy
by sticking him onto a stalactite .
yeah 
what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feat ?
i dunno ,
but he sure gives reality a run for the money .
