pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episode of the tv series ,
strung together
without the usual commercial .
the story is typical of pokemon
( conflict 
fighting 
and a resolution
where all are happy in the end ) ,
and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation .
some of the hole in the plot are filled in
( over the closing credit ! )
without explanation ,
and everything is just a bit too sweet.why see it on the big screen ?
the only reason is to be a part of your child 's world .
both of my son enjoy pokemon ,
and by my showing an interest in what they like ,
we are closer .
seeing a film in a theatre is still different
than seeing it on the tube ,
and my son enjoy the full movie-going experience .
i gave the movie a 4 
mostly from my child 's point of view .
