this is the most disturbing film i
have ever seen .
it makes `` requiem for a dream '' look like a disney film .
although 
technically 
it is reasonably well made 
acting 
cinematography 
music ,
directing 
etc. 
are good .
however 
the concluding gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing i have ever seen
and i really wish
i had not seen it .
i am afraid
that it will haunt me for the rest of my life .
although i think
anyone would find the film extremely disturbing ,
my wife and some of her friend were victimized in a very similar manner
and i really did not need an explicit reminder of the horror
that they experienced .
i saw the film at the sxsw film festival in austin 
tx and none of the cast or crew were in attendance .
i would have liked for them to have had the opportunity
to defend the violence in their film ,
which i felt was excessive 
gratuitous and unnecessary .
an earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood
they were apparently striving for ,
but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence .
this film should have a big warning label on it .
for these reason i would not recommend anyone seeing it .
you have been warned .
