i gave 1 to this film .
i can not understand how ettore scola 
one of the greater director of italian cinema 
made a film like this 
so stupid and ridiculous !
all the story of the person
involved in the movie
are unsubstantial 
boring and not interesting .
too long 
too boring .
the only thing i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann .
hope
that scola will change radically theme and style in his next film .
