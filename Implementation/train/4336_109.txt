laid up and drugged out 
as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract ,
with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkiller swoon me into semi-oblivion ,
i happened to catch this movie on cable .
i would not want anyone to think
that i paid to view it in a cinema ,
or rented it 
or \u0096 heaven forfend !
\u0096
that i watched
it straight.having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed room and dread passageway of the house ,
battling chariot
( type 27 ) ,
the hanged man
( type 041 ) ,
and other impossible sentinel 
my curiosity was piqued
as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.it does not.the banal plot revolf around a group of `` crazy kid '' \u0096 a la scooby doo \u0096
attending a remote island for a world-shaking `` rave '' \u0096 whatever
that is .
( you kid today with your hula-hoop and your mini-skirt and your pat boone )
after ibing a boat captain thousand in cash to ferry them there
( a stupidity
which begs its own network of rhetoric ) ,
they find the `` rave '' deserted.passing mention is made of a `` house '' \u0096
presumably the titular house of the dead \u0096
but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor set and other locale divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler ,
showing the island in the thro of a \u0096 party ? !
is that it ?
oh 
so this `` rave '' thingy is just a `` party '' ?
in the grand tradition of re-euphemizing `` used car '' as `` pre-owned '' 
or `` shell shock ''
as `` post-traumatic stress disorder '' ,
the word `` party '' is now too square for you drug-addled 
silicone-implanted 
metrosexual jagoff ?
it is learned
that the party was oken up by rampaging zombie .
intelligent thought
stop here i do not think the pinhead
who call themselves screenwriter and director
understand
the mythos behind zombie re-animation .
zombie can not die \u0096
they are already un-dead .
they do not bleed ,
they know no pain .
unless their body are completely annihilated ,
they will continue being animated .
at least 
that is what my jamaican witch priestess tell me.which means
that a .45 shot into their `` heart '' is not going to stop them ,
nor will a machete to the torso .
and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not ing forth gout of blood .
at least in the video game 's logic 
the shooter pump so many round into each monster
that it is completely decimated ,
leaving a fetid mush
that can not re-animate itself.yet each actor-slash-model gets their matrix-circular-camera moment ,
slaying zombie on all front with single bullet and karate chop to the sternum .
seriously 
these zombie are more ineffective than the stormtrooper from `` return of the jedi '' ,
who get knocked out
when ewok trip them.i suppose the film 's writer 
mark altman ,
having penned the not-too-shabby `` free enterprise '' ,
felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference 
in the character of jurgen prochnow ,
who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill .
there is also a reference to prochnow 's primo role in the magnificent `` das boot '' ,
when one of the untrained b-actor mention
that he `` looks like a u-boat captain '' .
`` .
i wonder
how many of this movie 's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on any of the snide reference to other film ,
as when prochnow declares ,
`` say hello to my little friend '' 
presaging his machine gun moment .
aimed at a demographic
who have not the wherewithal
to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video-game concept
( i.e .
the game ends
when you die \u0096
you can not win ) ,
this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart .
accordingly ,
everyone dy in due course ,
except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people.a better use for this film 's scan not yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school ,
although ona grauer 's left east did a good job ,
as did her right east \u0096 and those slomo running scene :
priceless !
i especially liked the final scene with ona
trying to act like she is been stabbed ,
but looking like she is just eaten ice cream too fast.attempting
to do something more constructive with my time ,
i pulled out my digitally-restored 
35th anniversary 
special edition 
widescreen anamorphic dvd of `` mano :
the hand of fate . ''
ah 
yes !
\u0096 the drug were suitably ain-numbing -
now here was some quality film-making
