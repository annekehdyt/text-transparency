i can not really think of any redeeming feature of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction .
forget the product placement disaster ,
the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot-hole .
this was not only laughable and but painful to watch .
even the action was boring .
a mixture of mtv inspired production value and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.what a shame
that sci-fi this bad can still be made
after we have had bladerunner 
minority report or to a lesser extent dark city
( by the same director ) .
this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list .
truly awful .
