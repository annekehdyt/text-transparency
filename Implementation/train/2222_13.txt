this worldwide was the cheap man 's version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotion made back in the 1980s on the localized `` big 3 '' station during the saturday morning/afternoon wrestling craze .
when ted turner got his hand on crockett 's failed version of nwa
he turned it into world championship wrestling
and proceeded to drop all nwa reference all together .
nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo
and moved off the road to disney/mgm studio in orlando ,
florida and eventually became nothing more than recap show for wcw 's nitro 
thunder 
and saturday night .
worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner
to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf .
today the entire nwa world wide/wcw worldwide video tape archive along with the entire nwa/wcw video tape liary in general lay in the vault of wwe headquarters in stamford 
connecticut .
