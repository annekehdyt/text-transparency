the person
who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project
must be related to the writer/director/star
-- or is 
in fact 
the same person
as it defies rational
thinking
that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle .
how about this ?
you want to make a movie
-- tell a story ; entertain ;
draw me in with vivid character .
sure 
you can do it artfully
without bowing to the commercial element
designed for mass appeal .
however 
do not address element of artistic expression in a vacuum
in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative thread .
if i am to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread
then make the concrete faic easier to buy .
