i do not understand
why person would praise this garbage .
its wrong 
stupid 
unrealistic 
awful ,
and just about everything else .
the film is a view on life 
racial issue 
prejudice ,
and everything else
that strangely goes on in college .
this is where it fails .
it has no grasps on reality .
from many questionable non-sense scene in the movie such as for examplea black man chasing down a white man with a gun 
the black man
and stopped by the security guard handcuffed
and carried out
while the gunman runs right past them.the same white man snipering down person from a roof topic
which is stopped
and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped
and given a rodney king style
beating
while the gun man runs free
while a momant later being chased back down by only one of the four guard.as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs man
being beaten down by several black man
weighing around 160lbs
including the 105lbs bust a rhymesanother critical flaw in the film
are the shallow uninteresting main character .
from the scared and confused white person and the mean 
angry 
and yet rightful
( ? )
black person .
its almost as its an insult to both black and white person .
i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic person
who agree
that this movie is wrong to portray character
and giving them those characteristic exclusively due to their race.the storyline
which i will explain now revolves around three character .
one a black athlete 
the other a confused scared white girl
who question her sexuality ,
and the third is a white man
who is also confused and scared ,
then blames his problem on black person
in which he becomes a nazi later in the film .
they all have their share of problem and adventure
including sex 
rape 
fight 
love 
hate 
prejudice 
racial war ,
and oh yeah do not forget education .
which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out .
in which after they go back to their boring life
and think
`` being white is bad '' .
does this sound alot like your college year ?
did not think so .
i do not think
the director attended college especially
if he were to make this awful mess.overall this
is a really bad 
bad 
ugly movie .
if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issue go see american history x.
if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys .
just avoid this mess .
