while not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptation ,
this hunk of crud does not fare much better.boll seems to have a pathological inability
to accept
that he does not make good movie .
one of these day he will run out of money
and stop inflicting the world with his bombs.the acting was sub-par ,
the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompter and boll 's special little 'touch ' were seen throughout the whole thing.like all uwe boll movie 
this one just should not exist.plain and simple.just like uwe boll himself should not exist .
