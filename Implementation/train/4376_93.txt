the image of movie studio
being financially-driven instead of creatively
is not without truth
( in fact ,
it is more true than false ) .
this begs the question
why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full-length 
uncut version of `` hamlet '' with his complete creative control among other thing .
of course 
branagh had to agree to some concession
( a star-studded cast 
and a 2.5 hour version for wider release ) ,
but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version
that
they knew
few would see ?
could they have 
at least in this case 
had enough respect for the material and branagh 's vision
to create something for only a few person ?
that is not a question
that i can answer .
whatever the reason 
this is a glorious vision for those
who are willing to spend four hour
watching `` hamlet . ''
everyone knows the story ,
so i will not spend much time on that .
however 
unlike other production of the play ,
stage included 
this is a completely uncut production ,
which has never been done before .
according to some ,
shakespeare never intended for the play
to be produced uncut ,
leaving the decision
of what to include to the director 's discretion .
that being said ,
i have no doubt
that had he been able to see it ,
the bard would have been overjoyed with branagh 's production.the film is top-heavy with film star ,
although most have mere bit part .
all play their part equally well .
i would have thought branagh too old
to play the part of hamlet ,
and
while he still may be ,
his performance more than makes up for it .
hamlet is a complex part ,
displaying every emotion from grief to anger 
happiness to madness ,
and everything in between .
branagh nailed it .
derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius ,
whose deception and treachery set all these thing in motion ;
his unique voice is perfect for the role .
julie christie is also very good as gertrude 
hamlet 's caring mother
who does not realize
what is going on until late in the game.the classical actor are cast in bit part
( judi dench is on for all of 60 second
and has no line ) ,
but at least they are in it .
surprisingly 
no one takes this to heart ;
everyone gives it their all ,
and it shows .
special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal ,
who are excellent .
robin william is a little too silly ,
but he is not bad
( his part is pretty small anyway )
.yet 
this is undeniably branagh 's show .
he adapted one of the most famous play in history ,
and in so doing ,
he took on a whale of a project ;
it is impressive
that he got it done ,
but the fact
that the film is this good
is a monumental achievement .
what i really liked about this film is
that you do not have to be a shakespeare scholar
to enjoy it .
as most person know 
shakespeare is difficult to digest ,
but branagh and his cast understand this .
`` hamlet '' is still immensely enjoyable to just sit
and listen to the actor deliver the illiant dialogue and excellent acting.this is a must see for anyone and everyone .
it may be four hour long ,
but it is definitely worth it .
