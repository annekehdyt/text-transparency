the film is very complete in what it is ,
keeping one continuously
interested with the flashback to childhood
and growing up with such a bizarre father ,
and interspersing it with the tail of serial murder ,
one simply can not go wrong .
the very plot in itself 
the very story and essence of the film 
is entertaining .
it is the sort of story
that the director
( bill paxton )
could do so much with ,
and in this case ,
he really did do a lot with it.from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening
and where the film is going ,
and the creativity
that is behind this story
is first class .
i felt
as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish ,
and one of those rare gem that seemed to be without any boring lull
-- the action flowing neatly 
quickly ,
and tightly from one scene to the next .
it demonstrates just how far person can go :
so as to do such horrible thing to their loved one ,
and to do such act of evil 
in the name of 'god ' when they are disillusioned as in this case .
it also is sometimes interesting in its ' twist
and takes on the concept of morality as a whole.overall ,
this is the sort of film
that one easily overlooks ,
but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out
-- it is very much so worth your time .
