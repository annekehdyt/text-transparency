there were a lot of film
made by hollywood during the war year
that were designed to drum up support for our troop from the public .
seen today 
some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda
-- which they technically are ,
but of a positive sort
and meant to unify the nation .
this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre
-- having a pretty realistic script and good production value .
pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character
he played in many other film
( you know 
the tough-talking 
hard-driven but `` swell guy '' ) .
randolph scott is ,
as always 
competent and entertaining and the rest of the extra are excellent
( look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardier in training ) .
while the story is reminiscent of several other movie about our pilot and crew ,
the film is well-crafted enough
to make it interesting and not too far-fetched .
that it 
perhaps 
except for the very end
-- where the film is a bit over-the-top
but also very satisfying .
about the only serious negative ,
and this is mostly for nitpicker ,
is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and `` nut '' like me
who are both history teacher
and airplane lover will probably notice this
-- all other probably will not notice .
