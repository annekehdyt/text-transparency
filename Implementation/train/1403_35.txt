the flock is not really a movie .
it is a wannabe movie 
with wannabe actor .
not including richard gere ,
he gave an excellent performance ,
but when only one of the actor truly gives himself to his character ,
and the rest of the cast is just acting ...
the result is pathetic 
just like this movie .
you see 
the idea of acting is to hide the fact
that you are acting .
what the hell was claire dain doing in this one ? !
she is the most inappropriate actress for this character .
in 99.9 % of the movie she looked extremely out of place 
out of everything ! !
the only thing
she was doing
was asking stupid question ,
like `` do you really think so ? ?
``
,
and making silly faces .
i was embarrassed by her acting 
seriously ,
and i used to like her ...
she is the romantic movie type ,
i do not know
who picked her among all the actress out there ... . lol ,
and seeing avril lavigne ? !
this really made me laugh.. anyway..
if you want to get the feeling of throwing up ,
this movie will do the job for you ! ! !
i wish
i could vote -5..
