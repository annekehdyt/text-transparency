i really enjoyed girl fight .
it something i could watch over and over again .
the acting was fantastic
and i thought
michelle rodriguez did a good job in the film .
very convincing might i say .
the movie is showing
how woman should stand up for what they want to do in life .
she had so much compassion
and yet so much hate at the same time .
dealing with a ignorant dad did not really help her much .
even though he loved her he
was really hateful .
her mother died
when she was younger
and that also put some sadness in the role .
the love story was a part
that i really enjoyed in the movie also .
i felt
the passion
the y had for one another .
then again drama set in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream .
i thought
it ended just right .
it was the kind of ending
where you have to decide what happened in the future for them.for all you person
who likes a movie
based on a sport with a good plot i
'd suggest
that you check this one out
