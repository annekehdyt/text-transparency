supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter .
i would say
95 % is faicated .
i always keep an open mind
when it comes to movie 
however ,
this movie lost its chance
when it became apparent
it had narration throughout the film ,
something i can not stand ,
and to top it off ,
the heroine of the story is so hateful
and depicted as an arrogant b ! ch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head .
it is too incoherent 
too flashy
and way too boring ,
it is a who gives a crap kinda story ,
and i really think
that big time director need to make movie
based on their own or a writer 's own imagination
not something
based on some ignorant snobby at 's life .
