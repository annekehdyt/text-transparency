what ? ! ? ?
why are person
saying
this is `` mind blowing ? ''
just face
it the ending is on of the worst ending in the history of cinematography !
4 left and the whole world has ended !
not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time
he got everyone killed .
1 was right the whole time ,
if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened .
person giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what ? ...
to make it rain ?
i admit
the movie had it is part ,
and the whole concept was fascinating .
but a lot of it was clich\u00e9s one after another .
and did anybody else get this feeling
that this is a lot like `` lord of the ring ? ''
character died for stupid reason ,
there was almost no character development ,
and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guy left in the world ; its pointless and stupid .
it was one of the shortest movie i
have ever seen ,
and thank god !
how is robots turning against human creative in any way !
it is been done like a hundred time !
this movie is really stupid ,
go see a movie
that is worth watching like star trek 
the hangover 
or inglorious basterd ,
those were good movie !
