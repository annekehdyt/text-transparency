if the crew behind `` zombie chronicle '' ever read this ,
here is some advice guy :
1. in a `` twist ending '' -type movie ,
it is not a good idea to insert close-up of every death in the movie in the opening credit .
that tends to spoil the twist 
y'know ... ?
2. i know
you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair -
you worked miracle with your budget but please 
hire person
who can actually act .
or at least 
walk 
talk and gesture at the same time .

i am looking at you ... 3.
if you are going to set a part of your movie in the past ,
only do this
if you have the prop and costume of the time.4 .
twist ending are supposed to be a surprise .
sure 
we do not want twist
that make no sense ,
but signposting the `` reveal '' as soon
as you introduce a character ?
that is not a great idea.kudos to the guy for trying ,
but in all honesty 
i would rather they had not ... only for zombie completist .
