first of all i need to say
that i am portuguese
and it is not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movie 
probably one each year or even none ... ...
and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese person
that the national picture are awful ,
really close to the worst ever made !
however 
in the last decade 
it starts to surprises me
when we get back the funny of the 40s
when `` le\u00e3o da estrela '' e `` costa do castelo '' were among the world best of their time 
with movie like `` pulsa\u00e7\u00e3o zero '' or `` sorte nula '' 
both from director fernando fragata and also with some actor and music in common.this one is also good 
not of the same kind
because it is not a true comedy ;
in fact it is officially a drama ,
a woman 's drama the has some unexpected funny part 
cause of humorous character or hilarious thing
that happen to them ,
like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid .
the plot work and can surprise us a few time ;
the actor are fine 
the location regular as the score ;
but the truth is that it all make sense ,
then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema ,
that seems to be starting from the ash
as the phoenix.if you want to watch a portuguese movie ,
surely you can take better option ,
but it stills one to be measured .
