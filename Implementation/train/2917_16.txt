i found
the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new year day holiday viewing .
its drama and action-packed episode were thrilling .
the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable .
overall the photography 
script and direction was perfectly creditable .
rather than taking the film
to be a repugnant piece of propaganda ,
as some might ,
i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious mind and ave body in the fight against crime .
again 
the depiction of a family
holding together even under the strain of the husband 's commitment to his
( arguably )
important work 
i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one .
