i watched this movie 11 year ago in company with my best female friend .
i got my judgment teeth pulled out
so i did not feel very good.i ended up liking it big time .
it is a hard watch
if you take in account
that it deal with friendship 
unwanted betrayal 
power 
money 
drug traffic 
and the extreme hard situation
that deal with living in a foreign jail.the acting
is on it
is prime level .
two of the woman
that i lust the most star
and that is a good thing .
claire dane is as cute and charming as always
while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance .
bill pullman is also great
and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.there are many plot twist
to dig from
and make it an interesting visual experience .
plus
it shows the difficult time at thailand.this
is an underrated movie .
not many film like this one have come up in recent history .
it should make you reflex about many thing ...
