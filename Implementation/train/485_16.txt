ossessione is in very bad state
but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen .
the material used is a `` master positive ''
2nd generation originally from the print visconti
managed
to hide from the fascist .
it has been scanned on the spirit 4k
( as 2k rgb datum )
then processed using davinci revival restoration software .
after this the rest is manual labor
and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring .
sometime next year it should be available on dvd
and hopefully also released on hd dvd .
this film is beautiful
and we hope
the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generation to come .
