and adrian pasdar a revelation in a very warm 
very real ,
and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complication gender dysphorium and transvestism cause in a young executive 's life .
at the heart of this movie is the very real truth
that you must accept yourself
before you can hope for other to accept you .
