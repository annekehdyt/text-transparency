at first 
i thought
the ring would be a more than normal movie
with it is ordinary plot .
how surprised was i !
of course 
the plot is simple -
one girl is in love with two man -
but hitchcock ings it to us on a silver platter 
with laughter and fear 
with compassion and anguish .
the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair 
the strength of the attraction of the girl to both man 
the tragic elemants
that come together with technique
that open the mind to most of his greatest movie
( north by northwest 
the rope 
etc . ) .
the master did it great even before his thirty !
