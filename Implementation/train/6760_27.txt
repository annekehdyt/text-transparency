flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house film ever made.this flick expose all the clich\u00e9s 
and then some !
excruciatingly bad
( downs-syndrome ! )
actor .
terribly heavy self important dialog .
scene
that are supposed to shock but fall flat .
jarring editing .
pointless plot point .
all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.it achieve
exactly
what it was designed to .
a hilarious satire of those tedious movie
made by spoiled teenage trust-funder ,
to show to their parent
when they ask them what they have been doing for the last two year !
after `` what is it ? ''
received its canne award ,
presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told
that the film was in fact a spoof 
in part of his own film !
he supposedly blew up at the info .
to this day he refuses to discuss the incident.anyway ,
see it and laugh ,
this will be a classic of humor for many year
to come .
