this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy .
it is neither clever nor romantic
and it is definitely not an effective comedy .
the fortune of the well meaning yet pathetic character 
`` tom '' 
oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another .
the only saving grace are the competent performance by toni collete and the frequency
with which we glimpse paltrow 's pleasant face .
overall 
to be avoided !
