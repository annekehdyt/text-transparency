i have yet to see a film with nolte in it
that i did not like .
however ,
this being said ,
he is made a lot of film
and i have seen just a few .
in my mind eye i am keeping the image of his performance here and the one in `` the thin red line '' .
nolte has a a full range of acting talent .
when it is necessary to shout
he roars like a wounded lion .
his best moment are the one i treasure in actor :
when he just emotes through facial 
hand and body gesture ,
without saying anything .
having come to the conclusion
that our present generation of actor 
by and large 
have no appreciation
of what an actor can do
without speaking ,
having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin ,
this generation of actor rely far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computer .
of course it is also just a sign of the time
we live in .
had chaplin lived in our time ... .who knows ,
he just might
as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools.i
have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen .
however 
the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted
that we can not follow the path laid 
even with all its surprise .
of course on the outset it appears preposterous .
however 
it is also not impossible.consider these for starter :
a spy at the heart of the third reich :
he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe 
america 's most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard
( look at amazon for more detail ) .
consider :
history undercover :
piercing the reich :
american spy inside nazi germany dvd
( i saw this here :
http :
//store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml ? id=75054 )
seems to be a history channel production.so ,
is the story ridiculous ?
far fetched yes 
impossible 
no .
back to the plot .
nolte 's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission
and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason
why he accepts .
was it a type of passivity ,
that he got sucked into this role
as it says
because it was the best story
he had ever written
and he got to play the part ?
that is a hard thing
to imagine any of us would grasp .
but 
it was an unusual time
and person
did extraordinary thing.the acting throughout
the film
by the entire cast is excellent
and as person have pointed out alan arkin 
always fantastic ,
is very good in a small role.i
was really shocked by the ending of the film
( no - i will not spoil it )
and it made me feel terrible about the choice .
did this person feel
that the road was finally over
and that he had spoken all
that was necessary
and that any more would be chapter added to a life
already filled with many burnt page ?
hard to say
but it really jolts.nolte gives one of the finest performance
you can expect ...
.the premise of the film make you wonder about a lot of thing .
it is very entertaining and provoking .
what great movie should be .
a bit long but worth it .
by the way 
the movie music has selection from one of the best living composer :
arvo part .
