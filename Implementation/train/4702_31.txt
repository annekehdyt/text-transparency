made in 1931 ,
this foreign film should be seen
and enjoyed more often.we open on a quiet little french village 
scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizen .
then we hear something
that sounds like a party .
upon
investigating the uproar ,
two neighboring man are told the story of two man 
supposedly friend ,
who picked two number for the lottery.our star of the picture has his number and his friend his .
when he asks his friend ,
would he share half of the dough ,
should his ticket be the winning number ,
his friend promptly says no .
in fact 
h.e .
double hockey sticks no !
is the way
he acts about it.so
when our man discovers he has the winning ticket
and that it has been lost ,
through no fault of his own ,
he is frantic .
everyone is out for themselves ,
looking for this ticket ,
in something like a precursor to `` the great race . ''
even though this is all a flashback ,
i was in knot the whole time
and got so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show-me-the-money cash-in-the-bank film .
watch le million today !
