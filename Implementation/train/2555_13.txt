this was a great movie
but it had the worst
ending i
think
i have ever seen ! ! !
the actor were great and displayed wonderful talent .
the entire story was twisted and unexpecting ,
which 
is what made it entertaining .
as good as the movie was ,
the entire film is judged by the ending ,
which was terrible !
maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending .
