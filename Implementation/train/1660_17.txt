this movie offers nothing to anyone .
it does not succeed on any level .
the acting is horrible 
dull long-winded dribble .
they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking
but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for .
complete garbage 
i can not believe
what a laughable movie this was .
and i am very sure
rosario dawson ended up in this film cause
she though this would be her jarring eak away indi hit 
a wowing nc-17 movie .
the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film
as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something
aimed at teen .
pathetic .
