not to be confused with the madonna film `` the next best thing '' ,
`` the last big thing '' is a silly 
campy 
off-the-wall comedy about a man
who yearns to start a magazine
called `` the next big thing ''
which review a variety of up and coming artist .
this low budget indie makes `` chuck and buck '' look like a masterpiece .
fraught with lousy acting 
poor set and costuming 
etc. 
`` ... thing '' has earned some awful review
and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award .
pass on this one .
