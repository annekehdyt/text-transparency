mary pickford becomes the chieftain of a scottish clan after the death of her father ,
and then has a romance .
as fellow commenter snow leopard said ,
the film is rather episodic to begin .
some of it is amusing 
such as pickford whipping her clansman to church ,
while some of it is just there .
all in all 
the story is weak 
especially the recycled 
contrived romance plot-line and its climax .
the transfer is so dark
it is difficult to appreciate the scenery 
but even accounting for that 
this does not appear to be director maurice tourneur 's best work .
pickford and tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl 
' typecasting pickford as a child character .
