i went and saw river and tide again today .
it is the second time in two day and yes ,
i do see movie i like as many time
as is necessary .
yesterday i was struck by the illiance of the image and goldsworthy 's work .
this morning
when i threw the coin i received # 29 the abysmal
( water ) .
goldsworthy has an affinity with water 
hence the title .
i received the 5th line changing
which moved to # 7 the army .
to blake art was a war .
anyway 
i knew
i had to see the film again.i read one of the few review extant online from the sf examiner .
the critic loved the film
but said
goldsworthy 's comment got in the way of his enjoyment of the film .
he had rather have only the image and the wonderful soundtrack .
so i was aware of that
as i watched this second time.yesterday i
thought
that i would vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world .
well today i could get a little bit beyond the image
and listen to what he had to say .
could i enjoy the film
without his comment ?
what he is doing ,
what he is saying goes way beyond `` art '' .
his understanding of water 
time 
stone 
change ,
and on and on made me think
the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar .
some of his work/word are zen like .
his knowledge ... anyway 
the film is only
( apparently )
being shown here in the bay area .
be a trend setter .
go to your local cinema
and tell them ,
no insist
that they have to book a film
you have heard about from the hinter lands .
it is called river and tide .
