this night listener is better
than person are generally saying .
it has weakness ,
and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis 
no doubt ,
but i think
its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performance make up for this .
the whole thing feel like one of those fireside `` this happened to a friend of a friend of mine '' ghost story .
one big complaint about the movie is the pacing :
but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate .
everything
that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility ,
and real life just sort of plod along\u0097no ?
so there are no flashy
ending or earth-shattering revelation 
no `` showdown '' scene .
thank heaven .
you have to get into the zone
when watching this movie ,
forget your reservation and your expectation of what makes a
( conventionally )
good movie .
william is not terrific ,
but he easily meets the need of the story ,
plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic
( `` no one '' )
as he is the everyman ,
the avatar
by which we ourselves enter the story .
toni collette 's performance should be nominated for an oscar
( even if she maybe should not win it ) .
give it a shot .
for quality and content alone 
the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movie coming out these day .
