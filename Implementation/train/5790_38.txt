i do not know much about the rat pack ,
and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me .
so
when i call this one of my all-time fave ,
it is nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality .
as another reviewer says ,
mad dog time is about symbolism 
not realism .
it is kafkaesque
( a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd ,
when he was so good as josef k ) ,
it is stylish 
knowing 
sardonic and slick .
jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of character ,
trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily ,
trying to stay aeast of what he knows and other do not ,
whom he can outshoot
and whom he can not .
gaiel byrne and richard dreyfuss
( his best performance )
have a ball ,
and the supporting cast look spot-on .
the symbolism 
the setting
( the one outdoor motion
shot with jeff goldblum walking down the step
seems really weird
after so much lounge lizardry ) ,
the dialogue
( style 
not practicality ,
is the order of the day ) ,
it is all about character interacting ,
not really gangsterism .
fun to watch 
must 've been fun to do .
what the critic were up to is really a mystery ...
