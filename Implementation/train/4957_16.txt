the plot of corpse grinder 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinder ,
what is left
that is different from the other film consist of weird aliens.it is my belief
that this film would be the # 1 worst film on imdb -
if anyone had actually watched it .
the plot is disconnected
and 
in several
( way too many ) instance ,
makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .
the real wonder here is why
in the world was this sequel
created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous
( but still somewhat better )
film.i would highly recommend this film
if you enjoy watching terrible movie for a good laugh .
