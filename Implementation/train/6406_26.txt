my wife and i both thought this film a watered-down 
made-for-tv
( bbc )
version of manhattan murder mystery ...
which is itself good ,
but not great .
the story has little inter- character tension or chemistry ,
and not much of a plot .
woody allen 's character just sort of wander around running off at the mouth ,
and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson do not have a lot more to do .
it is pretty disappointing ,
i must say .
ian mcshane 's role is just an expanded cameo appearance .
the first thing
that occurred to me
was `` i wonder
how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan ? ''
he must 've needed the money ,
and they must have needed his appeal
to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two star .
i am giving this movie 4 star instead of 3
because it is unbothersome background noise .
if you ever want something to have on
while you are knitting or sorting your stamp collection ,
this 'll do the job .
i would not pay to rent it again .
