this will be ief .
let me first state
that i am agnostic
and not exactly crazy about xtian 
especially xtian fanatic .
however 
this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother
for not letting him play video game .
i just could not take it seriously .
mentioning how charlesmanson thought
he was christ to illustrate the point
that xtianity can eed evil ?
i do not know
it was just cheap and childish
-- made the opposition look ignorant .
furthermore 
the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious .
the delivery was complete overkill .
i can not take this documentary seriously .
might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother
for not letting him play video game .
