this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre :
action comedy .
conceptwise it resembles rush hour
but completely lacks the action 
the laugh and the chemistry between the main character of that movie .
let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host ,
but he just can not act .
he is awful
when he tries to act tough -
he barely manages to keep
that trademark smirk off his face
while saying his one-liner
which 
by the way 
are not very funny .
and seeing him run
( even back then )
is not a pleasant sight .
in addition 
i have a feeling
that pat morita - at least by today 's standard - does not give a very politically correct impression of the japanese .
do not even get me started about the story .
i give it a 2/10 .
