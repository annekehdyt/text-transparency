i grew up with h.r .
pufnstuff and the dashingly talented jack wild and now my daughter are adoring fan of jack wild too .
this movie is exactly
what movie should be : fun and entertaining .
this movie is not limited to child either .
a lot of the dialogue is directed to adult and witchiepoo 's performance is something
you do not want to miss .
the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully .
and as a jack wild fan 
i would never miss the chance
to watch him dance or hear him sing .
knowing the hard life
that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially
when he sings the opening song
`` if i could '' .
it makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memory
that i am now passing on to my child .
let 's all go to living island
where there is friendship and fun !
and keep jack wild 's memory alive by passing pufnstuff on to other .
