a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scene and talented actor 
such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono .
after 15 minute of watching 
your eye get locked on the screen
and you do nothing but eathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting
what the destiny will ing to the character .
this film makes you leave your position
as a standard audience ,
it takes you in ,
it makes you a part of the story ... costume
and setting are illiant ;
especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built .
it is definitely not very akira kurosawa ,
however it still gets a lot from the master ,
especially the stylistic story telling tell us
we are in a distinguished land of cinema
which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance .
