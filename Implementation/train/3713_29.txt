whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome .
otherwise 
this is only for hardcore addict of elizabeth taylor
( her downward phase ) ,
and richard burton
( his miscasting phase ) .
tennessee william wrote
`` the milk train does not stop here anymore ''
and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play
-- but apparently 
he was the only one .
taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money.whatever ,
it amounts to a hill of bean with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner 
exploding at the servant and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward
who seems to be a visitor from another film
when he finally appears.it is so campy
that among taylor fan it is probably considered a `` must see '' kind of thing .
but if you can sit through this one
without a drink in your hand ,
you are way ahead of me .
sadly 
this is the film
that signified the end of taylor being taken
seriously as a film actress ,
even after winning two oscar .
for burton 
it was equally disastrous
and the critic called it a bomb .
judge for yourself if you dare .
