ti % s and as* 
lot of booby .
some great character 
fun filled prank
and well put together teen action in this spin off of the amercan pie franchise .
this feels like really old school .
it feels a bit like porkys for the 2000 's .
some great funny character
combined with some very humorous situation
make this one a real surprise for me.whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one ,
this movie i found really entertaining .
let not get too excited ,
you have to take it for the booby teen comedy
that it is ,
but for what it is 
it excels .
the character are likable and funny ,
the girl are hotter than hell .
the fun and game are hilarious ,
with some stuff i have never seen before in comedy ,
they make me cringe but laugh at the same time.so ignore the hater
and give this a run
and see what you think .
do not expect the classic american pie ,
but expect something
that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so .
