it is got christopher lee ,
it is got huge bank of 1970s computer
that make teletype noise
as letter appear on the screen ,
it is got radioactive isotope
that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noise 
it is got volcano !
evil alien disguised as nun !
tidal waves !
earthquake !
exploding car !
exploding coffee machine !
and as a climax the entire planet blows up .
how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly 
mind-numbingly dull ?
the answer 
my friend is because 90 % of this movie is made up of establishing shot 
most of them
involving long track 
pan 
or zoom in combination 
or occasionally all three ,
that do nothing
except give the crew something to do .
there are endless shot of our protagonist driving ,
getting in and out of car ,
driving again ,
walking around
looking at stuff ,
getting in car and driving ... i
just sat there
watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering `` say something 
please somebody 
just say
something ... do something ...
anything ! ...
`` the dialogue ,
when it does come ,
is terrible .
`` maybe their minute are measured on a different scale than our . ''
was a typically meaningless line .
the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage 
justified in this speech from lee as the head alien : ''
the planet earth has emitted an over-abundance of disease ,
they are contaminating the universe .
all the planet light year away from here will suffer
unless it is destroyed ! ''
this is is neanderthal sf script writing .
this is the sort of motivation
you find in the sort of 1950 's japanese monster suit movie
aimed at 7 year old .
it is ,
and i collect such thing 
the most god-awful line from an english language sf movie
since buster crabbe retired .
it beggars belief
that this movie was released in the same year as star war and close encounters.lee ,
who always struck me as a smart 
useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limit 
deliver his line
as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek .
i do not blame him .
