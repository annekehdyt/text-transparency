though i like e.e .
`` doc '' smith 's book and david a. kyle book of lensman 
the anime ,
which is loosly based on the book ,
is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.though
the story may seem familiar to sci-fi/fantasy buff 
such as some kid on an isolated planet inherit mystical power and avenges the death of his family ,
it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless .
plus 
lensman was the first animated motion picture
to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once .
sure 
it may look a bit outdated now ,
but it is still an innovation .
if it were not for lensman ,
none of that would have ever happened
( personally ,
i think computer graphic look better in animation
that live action .
) too bad they only released it on dvd/vcd in a few country in the worls
( mostly on format
that are quite foreign and different ) .
i just wish
they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd/vcd in every part of the world 
not just certain parts.p.s .
worsel rule !
i just think
he is so amazing and neat looking as well .
