i actually like asylum movie .
i have made it a habit to see as many as possible .
even the rip-off they have done
have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls .
this is just plain lame .
i can not believe
that the same person
who made dead man walking and dracula 's curse
actually made this movie too ! ! !
it is not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction
( which 
by the way are pretty bad ) .
this is just bad !
i mean 
i can appreciate and/or forgive bad
acting or lame special effect in an asylum movie ,
but this film takes itself way too seriously .
i really hope
that snake on a train is better .
now that is a movie i can not wait to see .
