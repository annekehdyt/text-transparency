look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent
put together
to make this movie :
connery 
fishburne 
capshaw 
harris 
underwood 
beatty 
thigpen 
even cameos by slezak 
lange 
and plimpton .
they prove 
in spade 
the adage
that a good cast can not save a bad script .
the story line requires so many leap of faith from the audience
that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standard .
it is not particularly original ,
and the `` twist '' are downright cruel .
