a warning to you not to be seduced by the name bigelow and red .
_undertow_ is pointless and unengaging ,
and made me think
often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the character would be drowned together .
when someone ings up the category of worst film
ever made ,
it is not the like of _plan 9_ or _attack of the killer shrews_
that i think of ;
it is the like of this .
what a complete waste of time
-- my own and everyone
who was involved with this flick .
