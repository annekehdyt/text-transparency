cinderella is a beautiful film 
with beautiful song of course .
in fact 
it is one of the best film of the 1950's.i
think
all the character are portrayed amazingly .
you can see the cruelness of cinderella 's stepsister and her stepmother 
the sweetness of cinderella .
the mice are funny and sweet too.i think
they changed the tale a bit ,
but i think
it is for the best .
it is such a nice film ,
and i do not think
anyone could resist it deep down.i give it a 8/10 .
i do not think
it is the best disney film .
but it sure is a true classic .
