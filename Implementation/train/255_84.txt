***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** released in 1956 ,
and considered quite racy at the time 
douglas sirk 's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing .
the plot concerns the going on in an oil rich dysfunctional texa family
that includes big other kyle ,
who is insecure 
weak 
wounded and very alcoholic ,
played by robert stack in a very touching and vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee
played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone .
ms. malone 's performance is telegraphed to us via her eye ,
which she uses to show us her emotion ,
which mostly consist of lust
( for rock hudson )
and jealousy
( for lauren bacall ) .
malone is the only actress i have ever seen in movie
who enters a room eye first .
now do not get me wrong ,
her performance to say
the least is an absolute hoot ,
and is one of the supreme camp acting job of the 1950 's .
but it is also terrible ,
because as likeable and attractive as malone is ,
she is not a very good actress ,
and she is not capable of subtly or shading .
her performace is of one note .
she does get to do a wicked mambo ,
and in a great montage 
as unloving daddy
played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase ,
sirk mix
it up with an almost mad malone
doing a orgasmic dance
as she undresses .
stack ,
( who should have won an oscar )
and malone ,
( who won the award ,
but should not have )
are the real star of the film 
the one
who set all the hysteria ,
both sexual and otherwise in motion ,
while the `` real star '' of the film 
hudson and bacall fade to grey and own ,
which are the color
that they are mainly costumed in .
hudson
who was a better actor
then given credit for plays the childhood and best friend of stack 's 
and the stalked love interest of malone 's who moans and groan over rock through most of the film .
but hudson wants no part of her ,
and instead is in love with bacall
who is married to stack .
no one is very happy
and no one is happy for very long .
the stack-bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year ,
and stack pretty much drink himself into oblivion
because he thinks
he is sterile ,
and can not give bacall a baby
to prove
that he is a man .
sirk
who was a very intelligent man ,
and had a long and fascinating career both in film and theatre in germany ,
ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950 's with a series of intense vividly colored `` woman 's movie '' or melodramas .
although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material 
in sirk 's hand
they became masterpiece of the genre .
sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design
which he ought to play in these film
filling his wide screen space with character
who played out their emotional life among weird color combination and lighting ,
make believe shadow 
and lot of mirroed reflection .
in `` written '' the character are always peeking out of window ,
listening at door or sneaking around .
so in the end ,
after much violence 
an accidental murder 
a miscarriage and more sirk ends the movie with a final and startling scene of a `` reborn '' and reformed malone in a man-tailored suit ,
sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell .
