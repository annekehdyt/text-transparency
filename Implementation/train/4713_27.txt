absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality .
it has camp councellor angela
( pamela anderson..awful as the killer ;
her quip
when she wastes person
are not even amusing )
on the warpath slaying teenager
who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleading for good behavior .
we run the gamut of boring 
clich\u00e9d killing such as the slashing to the throat to one kid
looking for his freddy clawed glove 
a kid
who gets a chainsaw 
one girl
who gets drilled 
one
who gets shoved into the crapper
( filled with leech ) 
one
who is roasted ,
etc.it does not have one original idea to offer
and is merely a waste of time .
that is unless you want to see valerie hartman 's
( who plays the slut ally )
tit .
most of the violence occurs off-screen so
even that will not satisfy .
