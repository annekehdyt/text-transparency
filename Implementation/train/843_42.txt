highly enjoyable 
very imaginative 
and filmic fairytale all rolled into one ,
stardust tell the story of a young man
living outside a fantasy world
going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star
only to find the star is alive 
young 
and beautiful .
a kingdom whose king is about to die
has said
king unleash a competition on his several son to see
who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witch want the star
to carve up and use
to keep them young .
these three plot thread weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting 
dazzling special effect 
and some solid sentiment and humour as well .
stardust is a fun film
and has some fun performance from the like of claire dane as the star
( i could gaze at her for quite some time )
to michelle pfeiffer
( i could gaze at her at full magical power even longer )
playing the horrible witch to robert deniro
playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection .
charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible
and we get some very good work from a group of guy
playing the son out
to be king
who are constantly
and consistently trying to kill off each other .
mark strong 
jason flemyng 
and ruppert everett play their role well in both life and death
( loved this whole thread as well ) .
peter o'toole play the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais
who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his ief five minute
( nice foot ) .
but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman
and the script made from his creative and fertile mind .
stardust creates its own mythology and its own world
and it works .
