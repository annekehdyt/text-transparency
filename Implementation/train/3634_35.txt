michael rooker is a decent actor ,
but he has no business being the lead
except in a low budget movie .
he really does not have much charisma .
ryo ishibashi has a lot more screen presence ,
and sadly he is not really the main character .
most of the screen time goes to the ick-faced rooker.danielle harris
( from the halloween 4 and 5 movie )
plays his daughter ,
and she is cute and entertaining
but she is written
as not being too smart
and one of her dumb mistake gets one of the main character killed .
comedian fred willard 
bobcat goldthwait 
and stephen furst are here in interesting role .
just watching what happens to these character is priceless .
vincent schiavelli plays the consigliare to the local mafia godfather ,
and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy .
tim thomerson is also in this movie .
he seems to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie .
thomerson is also in some low-budget comedy .
seeing so many comedian and comic actor in this film made
it feel like a spoof .
is it a parody of a yakuza movie ?
it is hard to tell at some point .
there is certainly very little yakuza action .
the supporting cast of thug and goon is menacing and well cast .
some of these kind of movie have thug
that look like they work at the local comic book store or as stock boy at piggly-wiggly .
overall this movie is very uneven .
at some point it seems like a comedy or a parody .
then at other point it works as a good action movie .
then it sputters to an end .
without the contribution of danielle harris and ryo ishibashi this movie would rate a zero in my humble opinion .
