why do person
who do not know
what a particular time in the past was like feel the need
to try to define that time for other ?
replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon-landing with the titanic sinking
and you have got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera
populated entirely by low-life trash .
is this what kid
who were too young to be allowed
to go to woodstock
and who failed grade school composition do ?
`` i will show those old meanie ,
i will put out my own movie and prove
that you do not have to know nuttin about your topic
to still make money ! ''
yeah 
we already know that .
the one thing
watching this film
did for me
was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking .
the next time i see a slut in a bar
who looks like diane lane ,
i am running the other way .
it is child abuse to let parent
that worthless raise kid .
it is audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick
as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969 .
