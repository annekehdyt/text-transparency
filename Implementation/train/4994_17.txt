blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way
that makes any possible sense .
at one point 
some kid are wandering thru the deeper level ,
exploring .
they begin to discuss
what they will find down there and one of them
( a girl )
says
she bets they will find a blue monkey.yes 
thats it .
totally inconsequential to the story ,
the only sad connection to the title 
and no idea
why she would suppose
she had find a blue monkey in a hospital 's basement.i am embarrassed
for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose !
