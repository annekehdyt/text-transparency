i went on a visit to one of my relative a while back ,
and we popped by a theatre ,
so we 'd thought
we 'd go in
and give this film a go .
what a mistake !
this film is awful in every department .
i would never heard of the film before ,
and literally everyone still has not .
no wonder 
this is as rank
as it gets .
it is a comedy ,
so it says ,
well the only thing funny is the ability 
or lack of it 
of the director
to make such a film .
getting so close to christmas ,
this should be titled how to under-cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hour - or however long it was ,
as i walked out .
at the end of the film 
you will come out feeling
as though you have been food poisoned on a sick turkey ,
and regret
you wasted your time on such dribble .
who knows
why such thing get made .
some person had walked out from the theatre
before the film was well over ,
and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier .
it really annoys me
that you pay good money
to see something decent ,
and all
that you come out
and see
is a poor tv movie
that should be showed at 2 o'clock in the morning ,
in fact 
it is that bad 
day time tv should not be showing it .
what else can a say
... probably not enough bad word
could do it justice .
