realistic movie 
sure 
except for the fact
that the character do not look like to be scared .
when billy zane try to kill someone ,
he feels bad ...
but he does not look like to .
that is why
i do not like his performance in this movie .
tom berenger is again playing a soldier .
no good thrill 
realistic sequence .
not always shooting ,
that is one great thing .
well filmed .
i hate the helicopter sequence ,
cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch ...
i give
it **and a half out of *****
