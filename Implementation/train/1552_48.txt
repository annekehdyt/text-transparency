`` convict '' is very much a third act sort of film .
all the dialogue and character interaction
that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day .
and 
by extension 
the life of its main character 
soll
( robert duvall )
.this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote .
six year earlier 
the worked together on `` the trip to bountiful '' 
a film
that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one .
masterson is not necessarily a good director .
in fact 
he is just barely this side of adequate .
the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita ,
who infuses the film
with just the right sense of fragile light and warmth.because this is essentially a filmed play 
with little in the way of editing or directing prowess ,
it all comes to the acting .
as far as i am concerned
there is no flaws here .
robert duvall and jame earl jone 
two of the best american actor
( both born in january 1931 ) ,
create character
that are wholly real 
uninterested in anything besides living .
lukas haas 
a young actor
who i
was familiar with from `` testament '' and `` witness '' ,
plays a character very much like his other early role .
he is quiet 
withdrawn 
slightly scared and sad 
somehow .
these are quality
that seem natural from him.perhaps a title like `` convict '' is a disservice to this film .
that title 
along with the opening scene ,
seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture .
if slow-paced stage production do not interest you terribly ,
you will want to pass on this one as well .
otherwise 
this might be exactly the film you wish
they made more often.enjoy .
