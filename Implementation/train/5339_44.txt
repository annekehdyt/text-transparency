**1/2 for this diane keaton farce.someone should tell ms. keaton ,
enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats.this flick is just too much as keaton 's daughter 
sara 
dies in a traffic accident ,
while her boyfriend survives.keaton ,
who could not be reached by phone at first ,
as she was in the sack with her pal
and had pulled out the phone plug 
grieve in a new way for grievers.she retreat to the summer locale
where all of sara 's friend are staying .
she cleans the house ,
sleep for two day and then begins to reveal thing
which were better not to be revealed .
it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy
who ultimately married the latter .
in addition 
she had an abortion thank to this guy .
we are all now put on this guilt trip.her
only hope is to find the elusive diary
that sara kept .
she also hopes
that boyfriend 
adam ,
who is a playwright ,
will not include all this in another play.when the diary is found ,
it has been written in japanese .
sara had a ph.d in this language .
it is not that great news for mom
when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant.naturally ,
everything seems to tie up nicely in the end .
the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz .
every time mom and sara would speak ,
they would both utter surrender dorothy.as
if this is not enough ,
during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning 
keaton tell adam not to be another woody allen in his film 
interior ,
where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman .
ms. keaton also tries drug with the group .
come on 
folk ,
can we realistically believe
that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this ?
fair to mediocre best sum up this film .
