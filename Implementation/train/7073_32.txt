oh dear lord .
this movie ... it was horrible .
i am a huge fan of horror movie .
and most of the time 
horror movie other person
say
are bad 
i like .
the actor
who played 'scarecrow ' was amazing ,
i will say that .
but this plot was awful .
it made no sense !
it had way too much gore 
and an unnecessary
( and revolting )
sex scene at the beginning .
i do believe
the director was trying to be 'shocking ' or whatnot ,
but it just came out awful .
to add to the pile of festering crap
they called a plot 
the actor
( besides 'scarecrow ' )
we are awful ,
and i cared so little about them
that i soon forgot
who was who .
in conclusion 
this movie made me sick .
if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway ,
please do .
