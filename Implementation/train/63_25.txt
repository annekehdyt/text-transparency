it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this .
it is truly one of the best acted ,
most tightly structured film i have ever seen .
every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several way ,
relating to each of the three main character differently .
the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivation and double cross
that snare you and refuse to let go .
add to this
that the slow-burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything
that is ever been committed to celluloid
and you have the ingredient for a perfect film .
it exposes the romance of movie such as `` titanic ''
as the trite clich they are .
if you are looking for a movie
to watch
while you fold laundry ,
this is not it .
you have to commit yourself to this film .
you can not have a conversation
while running in and out of the room .
this movie demands your attention .
treat it with the respect you deserve
and you will get a lot out of it .
unless you think
`` titanic '' is the greatest film ever .
