this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black man exterminating female on earth ,
in order to create a gay universe.i watched it with the intent
of seeing
how bad it was .
still 
i was shocked at how bad it was .
it looked more like a film
made 50 year ago .
the acting 
if any 
is ultra bad .
the set and prop are so ridiculously fake ,
making any college film look mega budget .
and the special effect are laughably simple ,
indeed jaw dropping
as other have commanted ,
but jaw droppingly embarrassing.one has to be severely intoxicated 
or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film .
if i was from denmark ,
i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated
that my countryman produced such a horrifyingly bad film .
