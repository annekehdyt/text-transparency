little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedy i
have ever seen .
they have a way
of producing the easiest comedy programming
they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewer
which for cbc mean 85 year old farmer in saskatchewan .
the joke are all predictable
and so deathly lame i can not believe it .
the performance are very hammy and over acted
but i do not blame the actor
since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped character are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded .
very lame show with bad joke
they tried to present as `` controversial '' well
it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedy like the hour has 22 minute 
royal canadian air farce and rick mercer 's report .
