this movie is pretty awful
but i have some interesting information about it :
it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in flagstaff 
az 
as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona 
az .
a good bulk of the extra in the film are then-drama student from nau .
i was a freshman there
that year 
minoring in theatre 
but for some reason i did not get involved with the production .
i did however know several person
who did and can supply this rather odd fact :
there is a scene in this movie
where two of the principal 
as part of their hazing ritual 
have to run naked into the wood .
they are seen from behind in the movie ,
doing just that .
the thing is ,
those are not the actor at all
but two guy i knew from the theatre department .
the identity of these `` stunt posterior '' will remain anonymous 
at least to this website ,
unless they decide to 
um ,
`` reveal '' themselves !
