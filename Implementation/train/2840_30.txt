i gave this 4 star
because it has a lot of interesting theme
many here
have already mentioned .
from the domestic violence 
to sexuality and many of the taboos therein .
outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much
as i would science fiction.it is bleak 
depressing and hopeless .
while i do not mind a less than cheery ending ,
i am really very tired of the `` human suck '' clich\u00e9
that is central to every movie .
i know
you can not get a liberal art degree today
without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race ,
but how 's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice
that the alien killing the human race are evil !
right now 
if you are reading this
and believe
that humanity deserves to die ,
just go out ,
find a lake and swim 'til your arm are tired .
this way you will not be around to direct the next film
or write the next book
telling me i deserve to die
for being alive .
it is silly 
not thoughtful 
and boring .
