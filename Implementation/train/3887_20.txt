this is certainly one of the most bizarre film
ever made - even for fellini .
about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon .
this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence 
opulence and sexual challenge .
sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova
and the odd going on in a series of unrelated vignette
taken from the great lover 's autobiography fail
to engage the viewer .
the art direction and costume design are however outstanding .
the academy missed on not even nominating the former
but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter .
also nominated
( oddly )
was the disjointed 
pointless and almost inacessible screenplay .
go figure ! !
the film on video is only 150 minute 
16 minute short of the original running time .
this viewer was grateful .
