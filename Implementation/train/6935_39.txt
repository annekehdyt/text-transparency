hubert selby jr. gave us the book `` requiem for a dream ''
and co-wrote the screenplay to aronofsky 's movie of it .
that movie succeeded on every level
by delivering an intimate ,
and unbiased portrait of the horror of the character life and the vice
that destroyed them .
`` last exit to brooklyn '' still has the vice and the multiple character living sad life ,
but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did.the film seems laughably anti-gay at time .
especially when in the film homosexuality equal death .
one gay character gets stoned ,
is launched skyward by a speeding car ,
and lands dead on the pavement .
another is crucified and still more are simply beat up .
another exaggerated piece of shock value ,
that might actually have been compelling
if it were done well ,
are scene of the union worker
literally doing battle with the strike-eaker .
who 'd have thought
a drama about brooklyner
would feature action sequence and truck explosion ?
the director 
uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director ,
but he is far below the cut for real movie .
the film is clunky
that can not even seem to settle on a genre .
lake is given a useless role
that any mannequin could have filled
and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part .
and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead 
a loathsome hooker named tralala
( believe it or not ,
i am not joking ) .
her performance is nothing great
and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least .
poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper
than it is ,
and also takes the `` real '' edge off the more provocative bit .
a failure .
