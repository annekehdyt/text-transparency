i am embarrassed to be writing this review .
i say
that
because those of you
reading it will know
that i sat through the whole thing
and that is embarrassing to admit even to stranger .
but i just had to warn those
who read the viewer comment on imdb
before they watch a film not to watch this one .
it is the least i can do .
this is a bad movie !
trust me .
the plot is goofy .
the acting is amateurish .
and the directing 
camera work 
set 
costume 
etc .
are all second rate .
let it go .
