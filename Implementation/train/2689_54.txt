well 
it is hard to add comment
after reading what is already here
but i feel
i must say something .
i was not exactly looking for 'a splatterfest '
as someone puts it or even 'blood and gut/gore ' .
i have some respect for the victim relatives
although i really felt
the filmaker did not .
-they were nameless 
faceless and meaningless .
just a vessel for dahmer sexual antics.i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity
that makes me think
'what makes a guy be a serial killer ? '
as well as wondering the specific about the dahmer story ,
of which i know very little .
person here seem to think
that the movie did not have to cover the event of the dahmer story.. i.e .
his history 
what happened
when he got caught 
the aftermath 
etc
but it is important !
you see 
i assume
if you are american
you will know all of this .
we do not all live in america .
to tell this story about such a man
as he obviously was ,
requires that at least some of the history and actual event are told/shown .
this does not mean blood and gut ,
there are way
of showing horrific thing in a movie by implication or clever filming
without resorting to gore .
without even touching upon some of what he did
( i found out more about him reading the user comment on this site !
) 
the movie felt like a void .
a moment in time with very little substance .
i would like to know
if there is a film about the real dahmer
because with its lack of direction ,
very slow pace
that never changes ,
strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending ,
this movie is poor .
i would not recommend to anyone
that they waste the time
it takes to watch it .
a definite 1/10
( for the acting ! )
