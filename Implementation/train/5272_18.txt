i am still trying to figure out
if there was a point to this film.for content
that is supposed to be so 'rebellious ' and 'controversial ' the thing
that maddox distributes to the student are awfully lame .
student seem to be easily swayed by vague anti-authoritarian sentiment and snippet of word illegibly scrawled onto leaflet .
rebel 
everybody.i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film
where a school fire alarm does not get set off.apparently a 'huge fight up on the football field '
is a fight
that consists of two people.character personality seem to wildly vary at random .
a football jock
who maddox was fighting
( and who subsequently got a staple on the face )
is all smile and apologies the next day.the fact
that it does not come to any real conclusion of the plot
makes me feel
that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special .
if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack .
