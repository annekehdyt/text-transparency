i bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous 
over the top 
entertaining bloodbath .
i got none of them .
this film fails on practically every level 
not in the least frightening 
or funny ,
it is simply terrible film-making ,
and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing .
what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw 
violent and utal
as it had promised to be ,
there is very little violence at all .
virtually no blood shed ,
and no excitement whatsoever .
acting 
direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable .
honestly 
it is truly laughable .
i could hardly sit through this total garbage once ;
i certainly will never want to watch it again .
do not waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ;
it is truly possibly the worst film ever made .
if i could give it minus stars ,
i would .
