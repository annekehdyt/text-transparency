i almost did not rent this
because of all the bad comment
but did anyways.i thought
it was similar to darkness fall
which i also liked .
the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck other at the gas station.they were funny
and the dialog made me laugh
but this was not a comedy .
it ruined the movie a bit for me
because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie
was the way
a horror or suspense film should be .
the make-up was good
and i have seen way
worse movie then this one .
it was a simple story with believable acting.it is not the scariest or goriest movie ,
but i was not ticked off or wanting a refund
after watching it .
on the dvd there was preview of other movie
that all look good and i am gon na check them out .
