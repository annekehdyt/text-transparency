the bible teach us
that the love of money is the root of all evil .
the love of money
lead to greed
which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction .
two other 
andy and hank 
will discover
how far the love of money will cost them and those
they love the most.andy hanson
( philip seymour hoffman )
and his younger other hank
( ethan hawke )
could not be more different .
andy is seemingly enjoying the success
of working in new york 's real estate market
and is married to his beautiful wife gina
( marisa tomei )
who is the idea of a trophy wife
if one ever existed .
hank 
however 
is divorc\u00e9e
who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife 
his daughter 's expensive school bill ,
and endless amount of child support paymant .
a man
who means well
and has good intention ,
hank none the less can not escape the water
that his slowly raising above his head no matter
how hard he swims to stay above it.however ,
andy has his own problem with the only difference between him and his other
being that he hides them better .
he has committed fraud against his company
and is heavily involved in drug use
in order to escape his fear .
the pressure of his life 
and the ly he needs
to keep his appearance up ,
have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again .
of course 
like hank 
he needs money to do this
and believes
he knows how to get it .
how ?
by robbing the jewelery store
that their parent own and run .
this act of betrayal is where the hanson other 
their family 
and several other life 
will be destroyed
because of greed 
pride 
and fear .
the uniqueness of before the devil knows
you are dead
is the manner
in which the story is told .
after the robbery goes wrong ,
and nanette hanson
( rosemary harris )
who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed ,
the story is told from a variety of different point of view from various day before and after the robbery attempt .
we learn more about the motivation of not only andy and hank
but also the reaction to their father charle
( albert finney )
to the death of his wife .
the relationship between charle and his two son 
especially to andy 
is also explored
and another possible motivation of sort is discovered
after it is revealed
that there is little love between the two man .
nanette may have been dearly loved by her son
but their father is a different story.philip seymour hoffman proves
once more why
he is one of the most impressive actor in hollywood today by portraying andy
as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also 
in contradictory way 
as a man we can sympathize with .
ethan hawke also ings hank alive not just as a loser
but really as a man
just desperate to hang on to what little he has left .
andy and hank are thus ought to life in such a realistic way
that it is easy to think of them as not just character but the very real image of lost and confused man
who now find themselves
facing the consequence of their action.before the devil knows
you are dead
is a moral tale about how our action lead to consequence
that we otherwise might not expect to face .
more than that 
our choice also can affect those
around us in way
we never expected .
in what should have been best picture of the year ,
we see
how life are easily oken
when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit
in order to ease our troubled life .
in other word 
there are no easy fix or answer to our problem
and trying to find them can only make thing worse.10/10
