i have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several month .
being a huge jim carrey fan ,
i easily saw
how he could morph himself into seuss ' grinch
and make the character his own .
i was not disappointed .
this movie was pure magic .
carrey is a master at his trade
and no one could have played this role to perfection
as he did .
there was plenty to enjoy for both adult and child alike
and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all
to enjoy in the year
to come .
i already have vision of my young daughter
sitting down year
after year to watch this remake on video ,
and i undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as i did the first time i saw it.clearly ,
this movie has jim carrey written all over it ,
and i do not believe
that it would have come together without him .
however 
the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right 
most notably the adorable taylor momsen
who was the perfect foil for carrey 's antic .
the set design 
musical score and costumes all lent their hand to a magical 
fabulous finished product and i believe
all involved can be proud .
it is not an easy feat
to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film ,
but howard has succeeded with flying colour .
for those critic
who disagree ,
perhaps it is your heart
that are 2 size too small .
