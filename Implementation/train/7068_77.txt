i can not stop saying how much i loved this movie .
this movie is one of the least
known and one of the funniest movie i have ever seen .
the movie follows the exploit of a rap group 
nwh
( ni # $ % rs with hat )
it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group ,
after it is tragic eak up .
following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn .
the movie is on a shoestring budget ,
but it does not seem to matter ,
this is a very well made ,
well produced film
and the performance by all of these actor and actress are excellent .
the main strength of this movie is the writing ,
there are so many illiant line and takeoff on rap in this movie ,
it is unreal .
spoilerthere are takeoff on actual rapper 
like mc slammer 
vanilla sherbert 
ice cold 
tone def 
tastey-taste 
and song
( booty juice 
grab your dick 
etc . )
rusty condieff has made an excellent film .
in the movie he plays rapper ice cold .
the movie does not quit ,
it is funny from the beginning to the end .
the movie works so well
because it becomes outlandish on occasion ,
but it strikes that line
where it is funny
without going too far out there .
listening to the three lead try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best part of the movie ,
like tone def telling a record producer ,
\u0091when you take the bus ,
you get there ' ,
and the producer responding ,
\u0091that is deep !
'the group portraying n.w.h .
has some sort of natural chemistry to them .
they work so well together ,
and they manage to pull this movie
of to where there is not a week moment in the film .
what really makes this movie
so good is how true to some of the rap group of the time this movie is .
many rap group had problem with violence 
with censor 
and like nwa 
the group only became popular
when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics.i like this movie
because it is offensive .
there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way .
the movie has a takeoff on a good number of person too outside of rap 
the funniest being of spike lee .
where they came up with this dialogue i can not imagine .
the movie has line after line
that will have you rolling on the floor .
as i said
before the writing is just excellent.i am not surprised
that this movie met such limited release .
it is an intelligent 
controversial ,
and even thought provoking film .
this is too much for mainstream ,
despite the fact
it is hilarious ,
and nearly flawless in it is production .
there are no major star 
but a lot of familiar faces ,
including marc lawrence ,
who plays tone def .
watch this movie 
at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it .
