this was one of the worst wrestlemania 's i have seen .
it just did not stand out at all 
really .
card wise ,
i thought
it was going to be pretty good ,
but every match just seemed to fall short.chris benoit vs. mvp one of the better match .
benoit carried it .
i just did not think
mvp was that great 
but benoit saved this match .
kane vs. khali wow 
these two guy do not mix .
or maybe it is khali
and any other person alive do not mix .
awful match.melina vs. ashley i am not a fan of female wrestling.ecw original vs. new breed i was excited about this match ,
until i saw it .
really 
really disappointing.edge vs. cm punk vs. king booker vs. jeff hardy vs. matt hardy vs. mr. kennedy vs. finlay vs. randy orton absolutely the worst mitb match so far .
just a major let down 
to many person in the ring at the same time .
it just did not live up.bobby lashley vs. umaga o.k .
not extremely impressive ,
but not the worst of the night.batista vs. undertaker this was maybe the best match of the night .
very 
very 
very nice to see something good for a change .
john cena vs. shawn michael i really feel like this match deserved to be last .
person make a case for batista vs. undertaker ,
but this match was just as good .
i am starting to get sick of seeing cena win every match though .
it is getting a little old .
now 
i have to say ,
i feel this match is the best of the night ,
but i am a huge shawn michael fan ,
so i am a little biased .
batista vs. 'taker may have been better ,
but i am biased ,
so ... sorry .
the last two were undoubtedly the best match of the night
and most everything else really came up short .
