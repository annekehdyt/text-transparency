now 
i like sci-fi cartoon .
however ,
when `` robotboy '' appeared in canada in late 2006 ,
i watched the premiere
and was inevitably appalled .
the character are generic and stereotypical
( do they really need to make an african-american man wear tiger-stripe print clothing
and speak in a jamacian accent ?
why are all the asian character viant yellow and squinting ?
does the mother have to have big thigh and chest and constantly complain ? )
to the point where thing become unrealistic 
predictable 
gross and sometimes disturbing .
there are heavy similarity to 
even stab 
at astro boy .
allow me to explain
( dub name for the young ) :
robotboy/astro 
kamikaze/tenma 
constantine/shadow 
gus/abercrombie 
tommy/alejo 
lola/zoran+kennedy 
moshimo/o'shay ,
and it so on .
brief resemblance to `` my life as a teenage robot '' ,
`` star war '' 
`` teenage mutant ninja turtle '' 
`` kaman rider '' 
`` sailor moon '' and co. are afoot .
not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping .
do not even get me started on the innuendos .
i will just say
they are hidden and quite dirty .
but seriously .
do not even try watching this .
especially if you like astro boy .
