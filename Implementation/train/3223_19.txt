sorry my fellow nevada city neighbor ,
but this one is bad.brian must have had too much botox
because he had very little facial expression
through out
the entire movie.alice looked like
she had a board strapped to her backside .
she was stiff throughout
the movie.i looked up both alice and brian
and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work .
i would have guessed
that they were first-year students.ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line .
ed certainly has not lost his charisma .
i wish i would taken the time
to meet him
while he was here.i love the snow scene and scene of store and the church
because i have been there .
i make nevada city my home
and was anxiously awaiting the premiere .
i was sadly disappointed.sorry .
