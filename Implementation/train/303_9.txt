the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah .
rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde role
that she usually does she plays a street-smart 
intelligent 
world-weary character .
she does not have a huge role
but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of ,
although used to ,
covering up for her boss ' indiscretion .
