the sentinel is a movie
that was recommended to me year ago ,
by my father ,
and i have seen it many time since .
it always manages to entertain me ,
while being effectively creepy as well .
the flashback scene are what really made it for me .
cristina raine 's father running around all creepily ,
with the two creepy woman ,
always manages to send chill down my spine .
it is your typical good vs evil thing ,
but at least it manages to be entertaining .
the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history .
it has plenty of shock and suspense ,
seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen ,
had me on the edge of my seat .
the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension .
we are never fully comfortable
whenever allison is on screen .
we know
something
terrible is always awaiting her ,
and that made thing all the more tense .
this movie is often neglected among horror fan ,
but i personally think
it is one of the better one 's out there ,
and it certainly has enough for all horror fan ,
to be satisfied.performance .
cristina raine has her wooden moment ,
but came though in a big way for the most part .
she is beautiful to look at ,
and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural .
chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend 
michael .
he had an instant screen presence ,
and i could not help but love him .

jeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable role

burgess meredith is terrific as chazen .
he looks like a normal old man ,
but what we find out ,
is absolutely terrifying .
eli wallachandchristopher wlaken do well 
as the bumbling detective .
beverly d'angelo has one chilling scene ,
that i will not spoil.bottom line .
the sentinel is an effective horror film
that horror fan 
sadly tend to neglect .
it will give you the thrill and scare you need to be satisfied .
well worth the look.7/10
