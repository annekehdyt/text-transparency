true 
the setting in paris is great .
the actor are fine .
the story is a twisted morality play .
is it supposed to say
that
if you want someone badly enough ,
it is ok to hurt everyone else along the way ?
in a real romance 
you sort of want less clich\u00e9 than the man
who has become bored with his wife
and is willing to dump his family 
and the woman
who is ok with encouraging him to do this .
so what if they are decent looking
and if karen allen shows off her body ?
the character are still self-absorbed and reprehensible .
maybe the moral of the story is `` you get what you deserve '' .
i give it a 4 
only for the fast scan potential through the `` male interest '' bit .
