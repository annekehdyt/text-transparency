when i heard
that this movie was coming out the night before halloween ,
i was very excited .
when i found out
that it was a book ,
written in 1978 ,
i had to read it
before seeing the movie .
i am
sure
the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book .
the writer actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book 
with minor difference 
naturally .
i think
the thing
that disappointed me the most about the movie
was boyle
playing the role of col. i
am not a big fan of boyle ,
and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie 
she is always trying to use her over-plumped lip 
and darkly makeup-ed eye
to make herself seem super sexy .
indeed 
i think
that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house .
my favorite subplot was the sheehan family
( which is so weird b/c
the son was killed in iraq and in current event
there is casey sheehan
whose mother went on a huge anti-iraq tirade ) .
in the book 
obviously the war was not iraq 
but rather 
vietnam ,
and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter 
i was truly creeped out .
overall 
i was impressed with the movie ,
in that it followed the book very well .
