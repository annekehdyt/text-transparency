when american author edgar allan poe visit london ,
he is approached by british journalist alan foster ,
who becomes the target of a peculiar wager .
not believing poe 's assertion
that all of his macae story have been based on actual experience ,
foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood
that he can not spend an entire night in the blackwood 's haunted castle .
once installed in the abandoned castle ,
foster discover
that he is not alone ,
as he is approached by various beautiful woman and handsome man 
and a doctor of metaphysic -
who explains
that they are all lost soul damned
to replay the story of their demise on the anniversary of their death !
the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror ,
i was mesmerized the entire time .
i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful .
babs steele is undeniably beautiful .
the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing .
the topless scene threw me for a loop ,
as i was not expecting it .
it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancemant ,
because this movie looks damn fine for its age ,
and it is the uncut international version 
to boot .
this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection .
