this is the movie for those
who believe
cinema is the seventh art 
not an entertainment business .
lar von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating .
you get absorbed into the dream
and you are let go only at the end credit .
the plot necessarily comes second ,
but it still is a thrilling story with tough issue
being raised .
just wonderful .
