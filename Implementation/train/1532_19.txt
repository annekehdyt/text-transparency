i can not believe
that they managed to spend us $ 17million on this film .
spectacularly bad acting 
egregious scripting and effect
that you could do on your average pc ,
unbelievable plot contrivance ... a reporter
who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un ?
what ?
not only that ,
but the message of this film is so unsubtle
that you come out feeling
as if they have tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix .
all this movie will do will preach to the choir
and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money .
if the maker of this film really wanted to sway person to christianity and show what it means to truly believe ,
they would have used the money
to help person truly in need .
now 
/that/ might have swayed some person into actually listening to them .
