there are many reason to watch this movie :
to see the reality
that whips latin america with regard to the kidnapping thing ,
the police corruption at continental level 
among so many reality
that we live the latin .
the performance of denzel wahington was illiant ,
this guy continues being an excellent actor
and that it continues this way .
dakota fanning just by 10 year ,
an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her .
the rest of the movie was of marvel ,
i have it in my collection .
i hope
that they are happened to those producing of hollywood
to make a movie completely in venezuela ,
where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency 
the traffic of drug or the political problem .
they have been few the movie
that they play venezuelan land
( for example :
aracnophobia 
jungle 2 jungle 
dragonfly )
they should make more 
as well
as they make in mexico.the song `` una mirada '' i hope
that it leaves in the soundtrack ,
it is excellent .
my vote is 10/10
