first of all 
i think
the below comment is unworthy for a site like this .
obviously you have no taste
and you do not respect the taste of other .
not to give you a history lesson
but i think
it needs to be done .
black actor out there are just ,
if not more ,
successful as other .
if you are not a part of the `` black '' race
you can not understand the quality 
creativeness 
and viant of old movie such as `` sparkle '' and `` mahogany '' and `` cooley high . ''
since unfortunately you are not black ,
you do not have the pleasure of feeling
what we feel
when we watch these classic ,
so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut
and just stick to your non-dancing race .
thank .
