i love the satan pit ! ! !
david tennant is such a great actor
and so is billie piper ! ! !
who else love will thorp to piece ? ? ?
he is so cute ,
is not he ?
i hated the bit where
he got possessed by the devil and where
he got told to `` go to hell '' ,
as rose so bluntly put it .
mind you 
he was quite funny
when he said ,
`` rose 
do us a favour ,
will you ?
shut up ! `` .
mr jefferson was so ave ,
was not he ?
dying to save the other .
i felt really sorry for toby
( will thorp )
when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time
because he was so scared .
i was like `` oh my god
if i was rose i would be so scared for him '' .
and when she hugged him i was like `` grrrrrr ,
he is mine !
hand off ! ''
but i thought
that was really sweet .
and the doctor ... .well 
i thought
he was gon na say to ida `` tell rose i love her ''
but he did not .
oh well .
