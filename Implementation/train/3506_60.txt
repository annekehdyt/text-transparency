leonard maltin must 've been watching some other movie .
( though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource ,
please disregard his comment on this one . )
he states `` start off well then fizzle ''
when it is really the reverse -
`` start off tepid then catches fire '' .
the plot is about as simple
as it gets .
happy mom 
happy dad
and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach 
dad incapacitated in accident ,
mom runs off
to get help ,
meets up with dangerous escaped convict .
mom try to trick convict into helping
while dad wait
and hang on for dear life.good white-knuckler
given an electric jolt by ralph meeker ,
appearing suddenly
( the director 
john sturge 
film it in a clever way
that will make you gasp )
around halfway through as the cunning 
desperate criminal .
meeker is an unusually flippant 
reckless actor
( at least here and in the classic `` kiss me deadly '' )
and he happily snatches the key to the film 's narrative
and speed off with the top down .
his character has a habit of grinning childishly
and saying `` pretty neat 
huh ? ''
when he is especially pleased with his misdeed .
there is a funny eak in the action
when they get a flat tire
and he tersely instructs his hostage 
barbara stanwyck ,
`` do not go away '' .
she fires back
`` where would i go ? ''
( they are in the middle of nowhere )
and he realizes sitcom-ishly `` yeah ,
that is right '' .
the friction between them is a hoot.there
are flaw 
somewhat ridiculous one .
there is one scene
where the police ,
who have been chasing after meeker for some time ,
stop stanwyck 's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would ,
and pretends to be asleep
as she is being questioned .
a. he looks conspicuously un-masculine in this pose and b. i think
it is safe to say
that any adult
who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement
would certainly arouse suspicion.still a sturdy thriller
which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion .
