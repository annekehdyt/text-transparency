if i could go back ,
even as an adult and relive the day of my summer 's spent at camp ... i would be there so fast .
the camp i went to were not even this great .
they were in texas
where the mosquito actually carry person off
but we had horse and fishing .
the movie cinematography was astounding 
the character funny and believable especially perkin 
pollack and arkin .
sam raimi 's character and sub-antic were priceless .
so
who ever thought
this movie was lame ...
i have deep pity
for because they can not suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult
or they never went as kid .
the whole point was
that these person had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again
and so they did at every opportunity .
i wish i could .
it was funny 
intelligent 
beautifully scripted 
illiantly cast and the artistry takes me back
so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even .
sortum like dance with wolf and ladyhawk ... good movie
but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actor .
rent it ,
see it ,
buy it
and watch it over and over
and over ... never gets old .
