there is a theory of time
that posits that all the moment
that ever existed
and will exist ,
actually exist right now .
it is a bit too much
to wrap your head around 
but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those
who wish
they could go back to a simpler time and place .
for barbara jean trenton
( ida lupino ) ,
that time was twenty five year earlier ,
the mid 1930 's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise .
for my part ,
if i could travel through time ,
it would be back to the 1950 's
when i grew up .
maybe to a place like willoughby ,
but that is another episode.one thing
that would not be so special about 1959 would
involve dealing with all
that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of `` the twilight zone '' .
how many reel do you think
it would take to catalog the entire series ,
and then find a particular story you wanted to watch ?
i guess
you have to consider the trade off 
convenience versus simplicity ,
having it right now
or taking the time
to spool it up to the exact spot
where the story begins .
popping in a cd has it
is advantages.i am a little surprised
that rod serling would pen a story
that so closely resembled `` sunset boulevard '' .
ida lupino 's character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept .
martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim ,
the husband turned butler
who 's loyalty is unquestioned .
where the story diverges has to do with the way danny
( balsam )
and sall
( ted de corsia )
challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs
that paralyze her existence.fortunately for us viewer ,
ida lupino had no such reservation
about taking part
that were 'not big 
but a nice showcase ' .
it is a real treat
to watch any episode of `` the twilight zone ''
and get to see
who pops up from day
gone by .
sometimes you get a two-fer ,
like you have here with lupino and balsam 
celeity
who sometimes made their mark before the series began ,
and sometimes after .
combined with the story
that the program produced ,
it is not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today .
