this chinese movie made me feel
so many similarity with member of a culture i do not belong
and are far from .
in an almost buddhist approach 
the film helps one to relate to each character ,
and to the happiness of doing the simple routine thing .
all actor are illiant ,
and xu hzu exude kindness and wisdom 
yet also vulnerable and mean .
er min 
the retarded other 
shows us
that intelligence and wisdom are not equal ,
and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate person in this universe .
a different china 
this is far from the chinese realism 
yet ,
it has lot of humanity and realism of a different kind.get it .
you will not be disappointed .
