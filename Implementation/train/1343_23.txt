you know
this is gon na be a cheesy movie when:1.
it was made it the 50 's 2. it is in black and white .
3. it has no name actor !
4. screaming makes up for the lack of special effect !
well not to be outdone - this movie illiantly incorporated all four of the above element
to turn this into a true cinematic blunder.okay - shhhhh
but i am gon na discuss special effect here
- or lack of them - did you catch the underwater scene ?
it looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium -
note the cape flapping in the eeze.and the repeated re-use of stock footage ,
( exterior house shot ,
the idge scene
-- great enhanced the k-r-a-f-tiness of this film -
not since `` plan 9 '' - have i seen such creative usage of stock footage.and hey
where there was a lack of special effect -
not to worry - screaming does take the place of special effect in this movie as well .
yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick.grab the popcorn - set your ain on stun
( several fermented beverage definitely helps ) ,
sit back ,
and wonder :
why the heck did they put this on film again ?
wayno
