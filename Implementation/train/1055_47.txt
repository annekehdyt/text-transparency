holy @ # % and this movie was still warm
and juicy from the pile
it was made with .
i tried to watch this pile of festering waste
but found it easier to slash my wrist and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner
than endure more than half of the crap
that was on my screen .
i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv ,
and that saying something .
i once witnessed a cow crap in a field .
i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half ,
who knows ...
it might have moved or something .
well that was time better spent than watching this tripe .
the acting was non-existent ,
the plot was somewhere other than on this film .
i think
i saw a cut seen early
on where the plot managed to escape
and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hope of becoming a steven king shi77er .
please tell me director is getting medication
he so desperately needs .
it is pretty clear
he needs heavy medication
and i would willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal .
bah ... i can not give this review the full punch
it needs
because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone .
let me just say
that if your looking for a flick to pass some time
and you see this chilton on the rack ,
walk to your car ,
start the engine ,
then shove both of your fist straight into the fan until
it you can not feel your bone viate anymore .
be sure to have your wallet in hand
also because you were going to waste the cash anyway .
you might as well have the privilege of wasting
it yourself.by the way 
i watched this after a `` buddy '' of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it .
he dint come over ,
she had too .
what worse is that she had to watch this $ % and @ thing twice !
i heard their married now
and he gets to visit his ball once a month .
i hope
it was because of this film .
