we watched this in my woman 's health issue class to point out
how woman are treated inferior to man in many society ,
and i absolutely loved this movie .
i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch .
the story is very touching
and i would recommand it to anyone .
i am a fan of different culture
and this movie was just what i needed .
this is a movie for the whole family
despite its rating .
this is a movie i will show to my child .
the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too
to educate about woman ,
but this movie was more than that .
it is one of those movie
that will forever stick out in my mind
and will be a favorite .
