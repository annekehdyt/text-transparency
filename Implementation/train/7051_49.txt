'blue desert ' may have had the potential
to be even a half-way plausible
and more enjoyable thriller had the main character 
lisa robert
( courtney cox )
not been so stupid .
when she is the victim of another attack on the street of new york ,
comic book artist robert move to a small town out west .
in her first day there 
she meets the suspiciously crazy randall atkin
( craig sheffer ,
playing this part well )
who will eventually not leave her side .
fearing for her safety
after having been in the situation
already twice before ,
she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop 
steve smith
( d.b .
sweeny ,
who 's character does not seem convincing enough ,
leaving disbelief among viewer
who should otherwise be convinced of the red herring
thrown by the writer ) .
smith need robert cooperation because ,
as he tells her ,
atkin is an ex-con and guilty of sexual assault .
but 
the cop have lacked the evidence
to put him away before.the movie
had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie
because soon enough ,
there is such confusion
as to whom robert should trust .
however 
much of the intended suspense appears too forced
because robert character never seems to react to simple thing
as we think
any reasonable person might .
and her delayed response allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly 
particularly in the finale .
perhaps sweeny was the wrong choice for this role ;
too baby faced in way that kind of recall kevin anderson 's persona evident in his character in 'sleeping with the enemy . '
or ,
if lisa robert was written as a stronger character ,
this might suffice as well .
in the meantime 
the film is not all that great 
even as a low-budget b-thriller .
