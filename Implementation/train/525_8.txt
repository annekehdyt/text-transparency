the performance in this movie were fantastic .
the dialogue was great .
jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as `` kid '' collin in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel .
far superior to `` the grifter '' ,
which was a good movie ,
this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir root from
which the story came .
i recommend this movie to all film noir fan .
