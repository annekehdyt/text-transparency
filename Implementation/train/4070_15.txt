i have walked out of about 6 movie my entire life .
this was one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
i do not know
how i sat through an hour of it .
i must have been in a coma that night .
i saw it in the theatre
when it came out 8 year ago .
i could not even remember the name ,
but i knew
that penelope ann miller starred in it .
it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today .
yech !
vomit !
barf !
