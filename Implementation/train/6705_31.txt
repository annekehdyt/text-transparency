i just could not stop laughing ! !
this movie is incredibly funny and stupid !
but 
never mind that ,
it is very entertaining !
in this film 
you do not need to pay attention to anything !
the acting is the same - lame !
the dinosaur are the same - rubber
( oh 
my i could see the stick
that holds t-rex head for a moment . )
the raptor are the same from the carnosaur 2 ,
t-rex is also the same ,
but ... in some scene his head looks kinda stuffed
and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten .
action is fast 
sometimes too fast 
actually i talk about fast editing ,
they edited it so fast ,
so that we can not see the rubber dinosaur 
but oopps !
to late 
they are rubber !
well 
only thing interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel.what can i say
... do not rent
it ...
watch it on tv 
with friend ,
it is much more entertaining !
