i think
a lot of person just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise 's weird movie
( magnolia 
eye wide shut )
but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie .
many person said
it was weird ;
it was not .
it was different and confusing but not weird .
weird is stanley kuick or pauly shore .
different is the truman show .
confusing is the matrix or the game .
and unlike kuick 
this movie has a conclusion .
everything makes sense
-- maybe not immediately ,
maybe not even today ,
but it will make sense .
vanilla sky is confusing
because david aame
( tom cruise )
is confused .
that is the point .
that is where the so-called `` weirdness ''
that turned critic away
came in .
if they had bothered to `` open [ their ] eye '' as the original 1997 spanish movie ,
they would have seen that .
and if that is not enough reason to see it ,
go see it for the music .
cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack ;
he uses it
to set the `` feel ''
-- that notorious element
that many movie lack .
with song like the beach boys ' `` good viation ''
playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie ,
he creates an offbeat ,
yet astoundingly `` right '' feel .
a wonderful film 
in its script 
music 
acting 
and image 
vanilla sky is sadly 
a superficial bandwagon movie
that critic chide in order to appear intelligent .
excellent :
a+
