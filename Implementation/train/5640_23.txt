a documentarist 
like any filmmaker 
must convey a compelling story .
will pascoe fail utterly in this effort 
cobbling together uninspired snippet of chomsky 's wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton .
the footage is shot amateurishly and in video .
pascoe 's only effort at cohering the fragment into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen :
`` 9-11 
'' `` activism 
'' `` truth .
`` lame.compare this with documentary like `` the corporation '' or `` the fog of war ''
which create a narrative drawing material from interview 
stock footage 
and filmed footage .
in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly
and intelligently.the only saving grace of the film are chomsky 's nonchalantly delivered upending of historical dogma ,
and the fact
that the running time is only 74 minutes.one of the more interesting passage was chomsky 's recounting of his experience with national public radio .
he describes the conservative medium as more accommodating to dissenting view ,
while npr 's liberal dogma strait-jacket its interviewee and dramatically limits its permitted message .
yet another medium outlet
to be skeptical of.this documentary
is for noam chomsky completists only .
