... do not read any plot summary
because in word the plot might seem trivial 
ain-dead and pointless .
the film is excellent ,
the acting by both denzel and dakota
( she will go sky high ,
trust me on that )
are just fabulous ,
and the plot is mind blowing .
actually `` fabulous '' is a small word
to use for such talented actor .
the film is just based on actual fact
and some character are not fictional 
a fact
that adds up to the shock
that i was having during and after the film .
if you are fond of both actor and of somewhat deranged film ,
you still have not watched your favorite one yet ... trust me ,
in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling .
the film is awesome ,
see it ,
rent it ,
buy it or whatever ...
just do not miss it
