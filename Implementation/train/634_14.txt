eric valette is obviously a talented film-maker ,
and so are the two guy
who wrote the script .
therefore mal\u00e9fique is a great flick ,
made with just a few buck
but also ton of imagination .
well 
i am a bit exaggerating ,
but nevertheless i am sincere .
so ,
if you like dark 
gory movie 
go and see this one .
it is really worth it .
