first of all 
the only reason person
keep bitching about this film
is because they can not stand a few part of the true story
being `` altered '' .
well guess what ?
peter jackson 's film was not a perfect rendition either .
well enough ranting .
this is a very beautiful film .
the background are gorgeous
and taken from well known tolkein artist .
the film covers about half the trilogy
( fellowship of the ring
and up to the battle of helm deep in the two tower )
and moves at a good pace .
the voice casting is top notch
and the most of the character look like i imagined
they would .
samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste ,
but aragorn looks awesome .
the film has a great score
that completely supports the movie .
if you enjoy good fantasy story
but hate reading
( the book are even better )
give this movie a try ,
keeping in mind
it was made 20 odd year ago.also of particular note :
peter jackson 's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi 's
( jackson has said
many time how much he admired bakshi 's effort ) .
