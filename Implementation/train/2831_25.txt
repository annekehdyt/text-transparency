this is one of those movie
that you happen across
when you are channel surfing on a saturday afternoon ,
and you get drawn into it
and end up watching the whole thing .
i thought
that it was well acted
and it really made me feel for the character .
though it is a bit slow moving ,
focusing more on the relationship between bonnie and clyde and their family member ,
it never got boring .
we do not really see too much of all the robbery
that they were so legendary for ,
and instead most of the shootout take place
when they are ambushed by the police .
i thought tracey needham ,
who played bonnie ,
really did a good job with her character .
going from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer
is a challenging thing to portray ,
and i enjoyed the subtlety
she ought to the role.overall 
an above average effort ,
especially considering
it was a made for tv movie .
