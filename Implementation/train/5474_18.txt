as i watched the first half of guilty
as sin i couldn`t believe
it was made in 1993
because it played like a jagged edge / joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s .
it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse `` is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney ?
``

but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credential
by turning into a `` lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client `` type film
which ends in a ridiculous manner ,
and guilty
as sin has an even more ridiculous
ending in this respect .this is a very poor thriller
but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man
who ought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry man
