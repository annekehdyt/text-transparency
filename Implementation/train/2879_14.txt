trey parker and matt stone 
the creator of the show 'south park ' 
return with something entirely different.they create a new sport
that combines baseball and basketball.this sport is known as baseketball.it is like basketball
except that the rule of baseball are involved
and there is another letter e in the title.here is how you play :
you just shoot the ball
while these two guy try to distract you from making the shot.sound simple.in fact ,
i might try it one day.after the game hits the street ,
it soon becomes a huge success.who would 've known that 2 immature friend could invent a sport
that became so successful ?
my opinion'baseketball ' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lot of slapstick violence ,
yet it actually delivers some laugh and plenty of entertainment.a definite recommendation for those of you
who like slapstick and rude humor .
