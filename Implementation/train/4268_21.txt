i saw the long day 's dying
when it first came out at the cinema ,
i thought
the film gave a good soldier point of view ,
it gave a realistic account 
of man at war .
the storyline moves at a nice pace ,
showing a group of man behind enemy line ,
and trying to return back to their own line with an enemy prisoner .
the character are well developed ,
and believable.david hemming is a good actor
and plays the leading role with conviction ,
as does alan dobie
( as german helmut )
i was surprised ,
that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd ,
and i feel
it has become the forgotten film ,
which is sad ,
as it is superior to many other war film i
have seen .
