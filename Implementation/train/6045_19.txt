this has to be the worst movie i
have ever attempted to watch .
in the first 15 minute 
there was not anything to keep my interest in this movie .
i was on vacation at the time ,
and had plenty of time
to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie .
the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock
-- they must have got it from the $ 1 store or something.if you like adam sandler ,
this is nothing like any other movie
he is made .
this started with a bad premise
and then just got worse .
there is nothing
even remotely funny in it.i have watched a lot of movie ,
including some i did not care for .
but if you decide to waste your time on this movie ,
do not say
i did not warn you .
