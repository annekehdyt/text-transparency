a question for you :
a family go to a new house
and get stalked by demonic force .
which film am i
talking about ?
every horror film you`ve seen ?
yes that`s true but that`s not the answer i`m
looking for .
i`ll narrow it down
by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scene .
doesn`t help ?
well there`s lot of bit where the character are stalked by a creature
and you see the character through the creature`s pov .
no futher forward ?
okay there`s a dream sequence
involving lot of blood ?
could still be any horror film
you say .
oh gawd this could take week so i`ll say
the film i`m talking about feature load of aussy many of whom have appeared in neighbour and home and away .
yes that`s right the film is the third circle
( aka cubbyhouse )
and do you understand
what the above exercise is about ?
it`s about me pointing out
how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s
been made
