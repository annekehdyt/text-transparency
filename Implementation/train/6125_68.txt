about five minute in ,
and i saw
where this was heading .
bunch of high school kid get annoyed by the school 's administration and thought of rebellion start fomenting .
i said to my girlfriend :
if it gets below a 5 on imdb ,
i will go and read a book .
it got 5.0 ,
so she persuaded me to go on watching .
what are the good thing ?
well 
it is a good thing
this film does not have a story ,
because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing .
it is like the student 's drawing
that was torn up by one of the teacher ,
all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident
involving a meat-grinder ,
and left half the stock destroyed ,
with the other half spliced into two-second bit .
even in a ten-second scene of the local tv news ,
there are about six cut and three different angle .
and then there are the montage .
these are all set to electronic music ,
which forewarns you of yet another montage ,
so that like pavlov 's dog you start cringing every time
you hear it ,
which is about every three minute .
oh 
i was supposed to say what is good about this film .
well 
the film was shot very well 
with a nice color palette ,
that nicely matched the emotional content -
such as there was - of the scene .
okay 
now with the film 's major flaw ,
and it was not the story 
or lack thereof .
the director made
that fatal mistake of leading you astray about person and situation ,
not by clever storytelling ,
but by being highly selective about what to show about the main character .
that is just cheating .
i guess
he did it in order to make the central character more likable .
but it just became plain annoying .
if the story is full of hole ,
it is no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer .
and often there was not even any point to it .
and then the ending .
basically 
the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy 
if a coward .
plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie ,
that you should stand up for a just cause on its head ,
by the already mentioned misdirection ,
and makes it into a point about the nature of revolution ,
that was already made 
and much better 
by animal farm .
it also committed what i call the bill cosby sin :
no matter how thing may seem at first ,
in the end adult are always right ,
and child always wrong .
and let 's face it :
unless you are me ,
that is just not true .
