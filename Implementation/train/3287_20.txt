i guess
that `` gunslinger '' was not quite as god-awful as most of the movie
that `` mystery science theater 3000 '' show ,
but westerns just are not roger corman 's forte .
portraying rose hood
( beverly garland )
becoming sheriff in an old west town
after her sheriff husband gets murdered
and having to fight off baddy ,
the movie is pretty predictable .
john ireland is rose 's new hubby ,
secretly working for unctuous allison haye
( yes 
the 50-foot woman ) .
also appearing iefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman
( miller nowadays stars in joe dante 's movie )
.i do wish to assert
that you will probably want to watch the `` mst3k '' version
to really enjoy this movie .
they had a great time with it .
