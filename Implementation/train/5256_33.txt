horrible 
horrible tv show !
why comedy central decided to repeat old episode of this program
is beyond me .
it really sucks !
i am 
of course 
speaking about the season after the first two .
the first two season were golden ,
and if i was exclusively talking about those season ,
this show would have gotten eight out of ten star .
none of the comedian appearing after the first two season
who were not part of the original cast
are any good .
they were ,
and are 
awful .
the comedy is not funny at all .
at all ! ! !
the original cast was full of very talented comedian 
like artie lange 
phil lamarr 
and mary schorr
( or whatever her name is ) ,
all of whom should have gotten better deal
after they left mad tv .
this show is highly overrated 
and less worthy of your channel surfing time than saturday night live ,
another horrible show .
go out on saturday night
and have fun ,
and leave mad tv to wither and die ,
as it deserves to .
