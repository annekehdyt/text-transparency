the acting is bad ham ,
all the joke are superficial
and the target audience is clearly very young child ,
assuming
they have below average iqs .
i realize
that it was meant for kid ,
but so is malcom in the middle ,
yet they still throw in adult humor
and situations.what should we expect from a show
lead by bob saget 
the only comedian in existence
who is less funny than a ball
hitting a man 's groin ,
which is probably why
he stopped hosting america 's funniest home videos.parent ,
do not let your kid watch this show
unless you want to save money on college .
expose your kid to stupidity
and they will grow up dumberer .
