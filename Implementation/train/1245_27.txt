this self proclaimed `` very talented artist '' have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century .
lack of emotion 
coherence 
rhythm 
skill 
humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again .
it shows no character development .
it does not even show any violent and/or sexual content ,
and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre .
so lame it should be shown at film school as an example of `` what not to do '' in a first movie.btw
where the hell is the `` talent '' ?
there are scene
which have been shot almost identically ;
there are scene
which have two or more master shot
and it is quite awful to see the action
jumping from one master shot
to another
without a reason .
the camera almost never move ,
as if the `` very talented artist '' was afraid of showing his lack of visual skill .
the actor playing the main role act like amateur ,
and the supporting cast is hardly believable .
there are more hole than plot in the script
( if ever there was one ) ...
a really disheartening movie 
and a whatsoever talented director .
