adrianne 
should really get a life-without mr. `` brady '' .
she nauseates me ,
and has been one of the main reason
why i know longer tune in to the show .
it is pretty ainless show ,
and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope
and analyzed to death .
this makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage ,
and yet 
i know
these disagreement are all part of life .
i guess to some person this is entertainment .
if this happens to fall into next season i
will feel sorry for anyone
who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash .
though i would not be terribly surprised .
can not even stand the commercial for this show anymore !
i hope
they are getting enough money
to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week .
however 
the `` a '' girl has one heck of great butt !
