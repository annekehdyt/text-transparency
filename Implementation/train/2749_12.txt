a damn good movie !
one that is seriously underrated .
the song
that the child sing in the movie
gave me a sense of their pain ,
but also their hope for the future .
whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here ,
but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character .
i wish
she was in more movies.this movie
should have a higher rating .
i give it a 10/10 .
