i saw this movie in the middle of the night ,
when i was flipping through the channel
and there was nothing else on to watch .
it is one of those film
where you stop to see what
it is - just for a moment !
- but realize after twenty minute or so
that you just can not turn it off ,
no matter how bad it is .
one of those movie
that is somewhere in between being so bad
it is good
and so bad
it is 
well ,
just plain bad ,
it is worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing
that it is both !
great middle-of-the-night fare 
if only for the fabulous tennis drag .
do not even bother
asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male ,
because logic does not apply .
