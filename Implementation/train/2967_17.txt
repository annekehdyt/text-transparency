another trashy grade z quickie from the prolific albert pyun .
tim thomerson\u00b4s 13 inch clint eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head
( ! )
to earth
and gets involved in a gang war in south bronx !
mercifully short 
but deadeningly dull 
with the cheesiest effect since attack of the 50ft woman .
they should have fired the continuity guy 
too :
note how thomerson\u00b4s sunglasses disappear and reappear in every second shot .
laughably bad ,
but that\u00b4s why we watch these movie ,
ain\u00b4t it ?
sequel \u00b4dollman vs. demonic toys\u00b4 is reportedly even worse 
if that\u00b4s possible.0
( of **** )
