despite what the title may imply ,
`` pig is pig '' does not star porky pig .
rather 
it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than john belushi 's character in `` animal house '' .
his mother repeatedly scolds him ,
but it does no good .
so much so
that he goes to another house
where a deranged scientist force-feed him more than any mere mortal can handle
( but there is a surprise at the end )
.i would mostly say
that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoon
( daffy duck debuted three month
after this came out ) .
but make no mistake about it ,
they do some neat thing here .
the whole force-feeding sequence looks more relevant today ,
given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country.anyway 
not the greatest cartoon ,
but worth seeing .
