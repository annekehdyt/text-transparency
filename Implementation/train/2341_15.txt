the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar .
akshay kumar possess the superpower of leonidus in 300 
neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman .
it is hilarious .
except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i can not see anything positive in this film .
the story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write .
the movie is so unreal
that anil kapoor long range
shooting with a shotgun
is the least most mistake by the director .
except for the director tashan
to make this movie
there is no other tashan .
i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody .
1/10 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero .
