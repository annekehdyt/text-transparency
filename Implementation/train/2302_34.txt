given the title and outlandish box art ,
i was ready for just about anything .
perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high ,
because i was left a little dry.a film crew
working on a soft-core sex movie
end up at a strange house
when they get lost in the fog
and decide the best way
to spend the evening
is to have sex .
where has not this set up been used before ?
the difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex .
not allowed to show all the good
( groin shot were illegal in japan for a long time ,
what is shown is fogged out )
the movie tries as hard
as it can to show the viewer
just how unnatural sex can be.amidst all the kinky going on 
a mud monster
( whose origin i can not fathom )
shows up
and begins murdering the man
and raping the woman ...
then murdering them too .
some of the sight are a bit much 
most notably a woman
having her intestine
pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of ... stuff ,
but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.ultimately the film is pulled down
by it is own design ;
it is too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome
to work as a sex flick .
the medium can work ,
but there need to be a balance.4/10
