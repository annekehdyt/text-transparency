looking back over the past 28 year
( since my first exposure to the show ) ,
all i can say is :
once you get it-it will stay with you forever .
i remember my initial reaction being :
1 )
annoyingly overacted 
2 )
under produced 3 ) unlikeable characterswell ,
two year later i watched some episode again
and did not find it nearly as annoying .
a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning
and quickly became engrossed in it is bittersweet tale of human fault and perspective on happiness .
yes 
the show has a style
that is not for everybody ,
and i am sure
the dated production value would be hard to deal with now .
but 
i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler time ... btw i am a married man ...
( for all
who think
this is a show for female )
