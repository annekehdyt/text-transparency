i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival .
based on a novella by science- fiction author brian aldiss 
this film attempts
to tell the story of tom and barry howe 
conjoined twin
who are plucked from their family by an impresario
in order to form a rock band.almost deliberately gimmicky ,
the film is also too clever by half
( if you will pardon the pun ) .
by mixing genre 
style and mood 
the director
( whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha )
lose their way pretty quickly .
i was never sure
whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not .
flashback 
dream sequence 
it was all just a bit much .
plus 
the promised rock and roll just did not move me .
i was reminded a bit too much at time of hedwig and the angry inch 
a film i
found original and moving .
but in this case 
the song just were not as good ,
nor were the main character sympathetic .
a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine .
