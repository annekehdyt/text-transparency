a new way
to enjoy goldsworthy 's work ,
river and tide allows fan to see his work in motion .
watching goldsworthy build his piece ,
one develops an appreciation for every stone 
leaf 
and thorn
that he uses .
goldsworthy describes how the flow of life 
the river 
and the tide inspire and affects his work .
although 
i was happy
the film covered the majority of goldsworthy 's piece
( no snowball ) ,
i do feel
it was a bit long .
the film maker did a wonderful job of inging goldsworthy 's work to life ,
and created a beautiful film
that was a joy to watch .
