yeah 
well 
i definitely had regret about giving up my saturday night
watching this strange little 
yet very long 
movie .
apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hour of my life .
here is the epitome of the antihero in 'no regret . '
we have this jerk ,
so messed up 
so wandering 
so selfish 
aimless and unlikable
that it was extremely hard
to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman 's up-and-coming son 
jaemin ,
unless it was just that :
physical attraction .
he claims otherwise ,
that it is love .
but after watching this 
it is like loving charle manson
because you dig the beard .
( alright 
he is not that bad ,
but still no real redeemable characteristic . )
i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalk sumin .
it was never shown ,
just told ,
that jaemin loves sumin .
perhaps it is a culture thing
that flew over my head :
crazy/stalking = mad love over in seoul .
it has to be ,
because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other
and the last part is stalking back
and forth to the point i thought
this was turning into a screwball comedy .
i was waiting for a tiger named `` baby ''
to make an appearance .
okay 
so sumin work two job
while going to school ,
so far so good on someone
trying to better themselves .
but after his first taste of his stalker 's attraction 
he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring .
what ?
ok 
well ,
as previously mentioned ,
the obsession does not stop due to the job/career change
and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry character
you get one messed up movie
where unbelievable occurrence just seem to happen
without buildup .
basic movie 
not 100 % terrible ,
but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movie .
