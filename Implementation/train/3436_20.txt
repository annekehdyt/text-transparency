muscular man-ape in the jungle of africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team ;
the comely daughter of the team 's leader finds him first .
much-ballyhooed version of the tarzan tale has an ok production ,
but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film i
have ever seen .
john derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shot and peek-a-boo glimpse of wife bo derek 's unclothed body ;
he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood .
trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality 
the dereks lack finesse 
snappy timing 
and taste .
they have a sense of self-parody and avura abandonment
( they do throw caution to the wind ) ,
but after a promising opening
it all goes to hell .
mile o'keeffe
( who possibly had marble in his mouth the entire time )
has the title role ,
but plays third fiddle to john derek 's ego and bo derek 's sense of self-importance .
