i never saw the original 1954 version with judy garland ,
so have no mean of comparison .
also 
it is been some year ,
but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating .
the movie tells
the story of two lover
whose musical career
are headed in opposite direction .
john norman howard is a worn out 
disillusioned rock star on the decline 
embarking upon a romance with a fresh ,
talented new singing sensation 
esther hoffman .
her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.the lead actor 
kris kristofferson and bara streisand ,
are adequate in their role ,
but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me .
the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect 
streisand 's beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song 'evergreen ' .
she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice .
