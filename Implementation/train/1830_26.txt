i gave it a 2
just
because natassia malthe
( as the vampiress quintana )
looks sooooo sexy in this movie.certainly there is very little logic to this movie ,
but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flick .
the movie probably tried too much to eak away from the traditional vampire story .
unfortunately 
it went too far
and made the whole story not just unreasonable ,
but ridiculous.there is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scene
that made me feel sick .
a good vampire movie should be more sensible
that you do not need to see a lot of blood
-- we all know
when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do .
a few moan or scream are all
it needs
to describe the scene
( like the one at end
when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa ,
all
it needs is a few moan ,
the rest is your imagination ) .
anyway 
it is just my personal taste .
