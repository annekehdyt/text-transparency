i have said this in other review ,
without a story ,
you can give the audience all the smoke and mirror you want ,
still no one will give a damn.the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco
( which i love ) ,
and i think
the idea
of using all digital background and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making .
however 
it is obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie ,
he forgot to film many scene
which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film .
( spoiler )
for crying out loud 
they forgot to have a villain in this thing !
ok they have one ,
but he is been dead for 20 year by the time
the movie takes place .
conran misses the point
of having a villain .
as far as action goes ,
well let 's see 
sky captain
( law )
shoots down one robot 
two or three of the flapping wing airplane
( before dex
( ribisi )
tells him to stop shooting them down ! ! !
) ,
and a couple robot 
but mostly spends his time looking dashing
and getting other to fight his battle for him .
paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie
( the reviewer
who comment on her and law 's lack of chemistry
is so right )
and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shot of the top of her camera ,
showing
she only has two shot left ,
both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie 
one uncomically 
one quite funny ,
although i saw
it coming from 70 year away .
no one except law and paltrow have any significan not time on screen ,
and that is the movie 's real flaw .
an audience does not identify with robot ,
they need a hero
to root for ,
and a visible 
despicable villain to hate .
without that 
plus a good engaging story ,
all the cg in the world will not help .
