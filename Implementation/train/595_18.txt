vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie .
vovochka 
the main character 
is anded early as a bad influence on the child in the neighborhood .
with the word of wisdom from a couple of grownup he meets along the way ,
he finds changing his mischievous way hard 
yet worthy of doing .
personally 
i found actor
who played vovochka too annoying to sympathize with ,
however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle vovochka has
when he wants to be good
but bad thing still happen .
this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movie of the same genre ,
that is the little flavor i meant .
all in all 
i did not really care for this movie ,
although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience .
