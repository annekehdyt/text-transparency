i have now written review for several of the moh episode ,
and this is among the worst .
an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credit roll .
if watching person thing
they never would in real life amuse you
( `` let 's check out the basemant !
`` ) 
then this is your show .
except 
it is not amusing or entertaining -
it is just annoying.the extent of the virus is never ,
ever showed .
i can very much overlook the fact
that it affects man only ,
as the resulting situation is very 
very frightening .
but then thing deteriorate
as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home ,
and ultimately dy at his hand .
the woman flees north ,
and runs into a few ten situation .
then 
some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her
( thing
that make you go huh ? ) .
or something .
then 
she is huddling for warmth .
the end.awful .
these director are mailing this tripe in .
