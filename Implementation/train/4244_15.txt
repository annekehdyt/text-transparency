this show was fabulous .
it was intricate and well written and all the character
where likable with out being horribly sweet .
even jonathan cake the philandering boyfriend was likable .
since our airwave are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the star ,
it was nice to see a drama
that was not too soap opera like .
it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance .
it really is annoying that we finally get a show
that makes you think
a little bit and have it thrown out
because of some mysterious number
that most of us do not even pay attention to .
some of us are not sheep .
this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of person but by some pretty loyal fan .
