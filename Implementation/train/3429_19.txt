( spoiler )
i was blown away by this movie .
i have been renting on movielink for a bit ,
and decided to check this movie out .
alot of boxing movie seem to overblow the blood .
in this movie 
it shows it at the amature level .
though i do wish
that perhaps more attention would have been ought to perhaps her improving her grade .
the movie points out the problem
some family face with gender.i was a bit concerned with the ending .
but the ending was not a disappointment either.i think
it was pretty clear by the title
that she had win .
what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end.loved the score for some of the scene .
highly recommended.10/10quality :
