this movie was strange ...
i watched it
while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis
( mushroom ) .
it was really weird .
im pretty sure
you are supposed to watch it high ,
but mushroom were not enough .
i could not stop laughing.. maybe lsd would work .
the movie is a bunch of thing morphing into other thing 
and dancing .
its really cheesy for todays standard
but
when it was released im sure
it was well ... one of a kind .
i could see how some person would think
this movie was good ,
but i did not think
it was very interesting ,
and i was on mushroom at the time .
if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit ,
pop it on you will get a few laugh .
