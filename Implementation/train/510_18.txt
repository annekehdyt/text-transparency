this movie has a special way
of telling the story ,
at first i found it rather odd
as it jumped through time
and i had no idea
whats happening.anyway the story line was although simple 
but still very real and touching .
you met someone the first time ,
you fell in love completely 
but oke up at last and promoted a deadly agony .
who has not go through this ?
but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life .
i would say
i am rather touched
as two actor has shown great performance
in showing the love between the character .
i just wish
that the story could be a happy ending .
