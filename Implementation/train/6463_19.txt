i have heard person
who say
this movie is dull dull dull .
i do not think
they were watching the right movie .
this is not the prototypical action movie ,
thank god.this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor
that just happens to be about killing person .
in this way it works extremely well 
with terrific performance from berenger and zane
( who does not sleepwalk through the movie
like he has in other role -
he actually looks like he is acting )
.i was disappointed with the action towards the end -
a lot of it did not make much sense
and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie .
but watch zane 's face as he panics 
alone ,
while berenger does the dirty work .
