let 's face it ;
nancy drew was never great literature .
it is in the same category as babysitter club 
magic tree house 
goosebump 
abc mystery .
in fact 
it was one of the original formula story .
nancy is perfect 
pretty 
thoughtful 
`` nice '' 
has no internal conflict ever !
and never change .
ned is pretty much the same .
the movie was true to that style
and i have to say ,
i liked it .
it will never be a great movie ,
but it had a that same nostalgic flavor
that the book held .
it had just the right amount of suspense for my child
( 8 and 10 . )
there was almost no offensive language .
i liked the push for more conservative dress.corky was a bit of an annoyance .
he was a little out of place on a high school campus .
i never quite got
why he was there in the first place .
