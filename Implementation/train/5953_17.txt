the house of the spirit is a gripping tale of family intrigue 
south american politic and super-natural power .
meryl streep 
glenn close and jeremy iron ing isabel allende 's novel to life with all its passion and suspense .
this 
in my view 
is one of the best film of the 1990s .
jeremy iron as esteban trueba age and mellow very believably ,
while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle ,
loving warmth throughout her relatively short life .
winona ryder and antonio bandera make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture .
glenn close 
as esteban 's sister 
gives a very moving performance .
the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country .
setting of clara 's home and esteban 's ranch are effective
and the period us car add nicely to the post-war atmosphere .
