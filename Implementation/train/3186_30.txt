inventor wayne szalinsky
( rick moranis )
is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking/expanding machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane
( eve gordon )
get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam
( bug hall ) .
wayne 's other gordon
( stuart pankin ) ,
his wife patty
( robin bartlett ) ,
and his kid jenny
( allison mack )
and mitch
( jake richardson )
volunteer to look after adam
while his parent are away ,
but as luck would have it
( and the title would lead you to expect ) ,
the grown-up are accidentally zapped by wayne 's shrinking ray .
as the kid run amok 
their miniaturized folk must contend with monstrously huge insect 
wrinkle in the carpet
that look like canyon 
and other threat to them .
this was bad ,
like most straight to video sequel are 
honey ,
we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable .
i had to laugh at that movie `` roach '' stuart pankin and the party bully were even more ridiculous 
view at own risk !
