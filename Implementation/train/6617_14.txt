this movie was awesome ! !
( not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot )
but still awesome ! !
i thought
ashley looked freakin ' huge
compared to mary-kate in this film .
i wonder why .
who woulda thought
they could swith place like that and almost get away with it .
dad was kinda a jerk
though
and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head .
i give it 4. any one
who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot .
