i read all of nancy drew as a preteen
and collect the book as a grown-up .
i loved the effect
used at the end
( and a little bit at the beginning )
of the movie where line drawing in the style of the book morphed into scene from the movie .
it was a neat way
of pointing out connection between situation in the movie and the book .
for example 
the scene with the oriental antique dealer were very reminiscent of many scenario i remember from the book .
i thought
ned was perfectly cast ,
and emma robert was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew .
( just like the picture of betty crocker ,
she keeps up with the time ! )
