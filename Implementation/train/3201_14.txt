jess is 18 
very smart and wants nothing more than to play football ,
when she joins a local team
she has to lie to her parent again and again ,
as they would never approve of her chasing her dream ,
they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy
and learn how to cook.bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie
that does not need to be deep and complex ,
it is just fine as it is .
the cast are all very good
and they play their role very well ,
the story is simple and predictable ,
but it works perfectly
and the script is very realistic and very funny.a great family movie 8/10
