rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie `` our gang '' release schedule 
`` a tough winter '' feature two storyline .
first 
wheezer and mary ann 
home alone on a wintry day ,
decide to make some taffy .
little wheezer relay the direction to mary ann from a radio cooking show .
the problem :
wheezer relay information from different show and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix !
funny moment occur
when the rest of the gang show up
to pull the taffy -
and end up getting it all over the house !
the second storyline deal with stepin fetchit 
a neighbor/handyman of the gang 
and his interaction with the gang .
`` a tough winter 
'' to my knowledge 
has never been shown on television ,
although it is available on home video .
the reason for this is the stepin fetchit characterization
which show a shifty 
sly 
and slow-moving character .
`` our gang '' producer hal roach called fetchit a `` skilled comic ''
and used this `` our gang '' entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series
that never saw the light of day .
understandably 
fetchit is characterization is offensive to many person today ,
which explains
why
the film has been shelved.although
there
are some funny moment both with fetchit and the taffy 
`` a tough winter '' is a plodding and meandering effort .
if one positive came out of this film ,
it was that the hal roach studio grew confident and experienced in making talky .
the sound in the film is good ,
and some of the sound effect used are very funny .
for this reason 
this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 `` our gang '' films.3/10 .
