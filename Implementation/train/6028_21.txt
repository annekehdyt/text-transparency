i loved this flick
when it came out in the 80 's
and still do !
i still quote classic line like `` say it again ''
and `` you said
you would rip my ball off sir '' .
ron leibman was hot and very funny !
although it was underrated and disowned by mad ,
i have to say
that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie
that i would take with me
if sent to a deserted island !
i only wish
that someone would release the dvd
because my vhs tape is about worn out !
if you like cheesed out comedy ,
this is definitely for you
and should be considered a cult classic !
it is military humor at it is best and worse !
rent it
if you can not own it !
