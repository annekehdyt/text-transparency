this is one of those film
the british lottery fund wastes its money on .
the main problem is a rambling script
which gets nowhere .
the character are not interesting ,
the story is conventional and insipid ,
the only thing of interest is the location :
the city of genoa
( genova in italian ) .
having only a superficial acquaintance with genoa ,
i had no idea of the intricate alleyway of its old town ,
and that the city was so interesting .
i had thought
genoa was dull .
i am delighted to say
that i have been proved wrong .
so from the travelogue point of view ,
this film has interest .
the film contains one splendid performance 
by a little girl
named perla haney-jardine .
she has already made seven film despite
being only 12 ,
so she seems determined upon a career as an actress ,
and judging by her performance in this film ,
she should go far ,
as she is a natural
and has a great deal of talent .
colin firth 
a reliable and professional actor 
was on hand for the filming
and when asked to be earnest ,
he was earnest ,
and
when asked to be anguished ,
he was anguished .
but somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue .
the script is a total shamble .
catherine keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role ,
and showing sympathy comes naturally to her ,
so
that everybody would like to have her around
( i would like to tell her every time i feel a cold coming on ,
as i know
she would get me a soothing hot drink ) .
so there we have it :
genoa 's fascinating narrow alley 
an interesting little girl 
and a sympathetic woman .
forget the rest .
the older sister
played by willa holland
is such a disgusting character
that the fact
that the young actress does a good job
of being repellent
is not exactly the kind of acting tribute
she would like to hear 
i suspect .
the notion
that this family go off to genoa
to forget the unfortunate death of the mother
is so trite
that
if we have another film like that ,
all dead mother have a right
to complain at being exploited .
if michael winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of genoa is ,
why did not he just go to the bbc
and say
he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celeity presenter ?
why waste money on a feature film
which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity ?
