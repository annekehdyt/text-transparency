some thing need to be clarified .
the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris
who starred in this movie .
i know
that because he was my dad .
please remove that picture .
also 
mark ferris was the writer 
at least one of them .
i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again .
it has been year
and if someone can point me in the direction
of obtaining a copy ,
that would be great .
the movie was not all that bad ,
and trying to compare it to todays world of star war and other high tech sci fi 's it futile .
if you watch it ,
just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses .
lighten up on being movie snobs
and enjoy some less creative and innovated film .
