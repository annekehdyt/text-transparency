this so-called `` documentary '' try to tell
that usa faked the moon-landing .
year right.all those
who have actually studied the case knows different.first of all :
there is definitely proof .
when the astronaut was on the moon ,
they ought back many pound of rock from the moon - for geological study .
these where spread around the world to hundred of lab ,
who tested them .
and they all concluded
that they came from the same planet ,
not earth :
because the inner isotope of the basic element are different from those
found on earth ,
but similar to those calculated to be on the moon .
i.e .
the conspiracy theorist never study anything :
they only take the thing
that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.another wrongful claim from them is
that their was wind in the hangar where
they shot the moon landing 
i.e .
the flag move .
there is a logical explanation :
the astronaut moved it with his hand ,
so it moved .
and what proves this :
well ,
if the conspiracy theorist even studied the footage ,
they would see
that the flag never move
after the astronaut have let it be 
i.e .
the conspiracy theorist are bad-scientist ,
they can not study a subject properly ,
or only study it until they have what they came for ,
so that they can make a lie from that ,
and make a profit
( i.e .
this so-called `` documentary '' )
.a claim says
that it can not possible have been filmed on the moon
because all the shadow come from different place ,
because there are different light-source 
the artificial lighting from the studio .
once again the conspiracy theorist are wrong
( as usual ) ,
the same would happen in an earth desert at night 
with no light-source .
but i doubt
that any conspiracy theorist have ever been outside their grandmother basement for more
than how many day a star treck-convention is held over.the conspiracy theorist are in denial 
big time .
they only see what they want to see .
so they make up all these ly to seem important -
that is a fact .
