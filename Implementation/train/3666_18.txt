maiden voyage is just that .
i would like to say straight away
that i watched 5mins of this
before i just could not stand it anymore .
as already stated in another comment ,
this film does not fall into the whole `` so bad
it is good '' thing ,
it is just bad .
the acting is awful ,
the sfx are poor ,
and the story is bland and stupid .
even the extra suck 
the `` bag guy guard '' and such appear to hold their weapon like water pistols.do
not even bother watching this film ,
the only thing special
about it is that ,
no matter how low your expectation are ,
you will still be disappointed .
