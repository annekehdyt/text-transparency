i saw the last five or ten minute of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night
when i was channel-surfing
before going to bed ,
and really liked what i saw .
since then i have been on the lookout 
scouring tv listing 
flipping through dvd/vhs rack at store ,
but did not find a copy until recently
when i found out some internet store sold it .
then ,
being a world-class procrastinator ,
i still did not order it .
finally 
i found a dvd copy in a circuit city
while visiting portland 
or 
a few week ago .
then it only took me about a month after returning home
before sitting down and watching it.so ,
what do i think about the film ?
it is good .
not as good as i remembered
and hoped for ,
but still well worth the $ 9.99 it cost me .
after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7/10 
with potential
to become an 8/10 .
i will have to be less sleepy then ,
and have a better sound system
to avoid rewinding
to catch some dialogue .
