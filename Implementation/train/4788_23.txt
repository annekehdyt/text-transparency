personally i think
this show looks pretty cheaply made .
some of the actor are terrible .
they over do it and seem fake .
i can always tell
how it is going to end within the first 10 minute or less of watching
because they make it so transparently clear .
it is not very well
written either .
i love to watch it to laugh at it .
you know the saying
`` it is so bad
that it is good ? ''
well ,
that saying apply to this show .
i also like to watch just to see if i am right
when i guess how it is all going to end .
so far i have been right every time .
it is like a little game
that i play .
it is nice
when you are bored
and you feel like laughing at something .
