the first two sequence of this movie set up the two conflict :
the -thematic- conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity 
and the -physical- conflict between todd and his bio-engineered replacement .
both sequence are quite gripping in different ways.people ' screenplay falter somewhat
by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie ,
which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.nonetheless ,
kudos to the maker
for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell
who conveys much with very little.not a great film ,
but one worth seeing .
