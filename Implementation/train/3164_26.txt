an average tv movie quality 
totally formula story of religious fanatic
( ron perlman ,
who gives good `` i am not just the president of 'psychos r us 
'
i am also a client . '' )
who gets control of a biochemical virus
( think the virus from the movie `` the rock '' ) .
too bad for him
that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robber and the government agent trying to stop him
( led by the impressively physiqued 
mildly entertaining wolf larson ,
backed by fred dryer )
along with the standard `` in the wrong place at the wrong time '' spunky female
( the forever bland erika eleniak )
and `` lived as a wimp
but died as a hero at the last minute '' male
( brandon karrer ) .
has the standard background story
to give sympathy to the religious fanatic
( wife and son killed in a police raid a few year previous ) .
basically a decent rainy day movie.favorite line ,
spoken by ron perlman
after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak 's cleavage :
`` a woman and her mystery .
`` worth a rent .
