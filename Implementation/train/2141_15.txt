hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show .
yes 
it is predictable much like the duke of hazzard 
hunter 
the a-team ,
etc etc etc.this show is just good clean television .
the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing .
they often take jab at each other several time an episode ,
which adds a great deal of humor to the show .
it contains several car chase in almost every episode 
but ,
who does not enjoy a good car chase ?
especially with the coyote !
i only wish
they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this !
