while the story of a troubled kid
turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management
is hardly a new thing ,
the story is given a fresh twist here
when the protagonist is a girl
instead of a boy.diana
has trouble at school .
she just can not stay away from fighting .
at home her father is constantly putting her down .
her other train boxing at a gym and one day
when she picks him up
she decides
she also wants to train.it
would be easy to call this movie a `` rocky with girl '' i guess .
but that is not at all what this is about .
the story actually benefit very much from the main character
being a girl rather than a boy .
that way you can deal with more problem at once .
first the problem of her not being accepted
because she is not a girlie-girl ,
and then when she comes to the boxing gym
because she is a girl at all .
it is also a story about how a purpose can change someones life .
how positive thing can make you grow .
i do not want this to sound pretentious ,
because the movie does not feel pretentious at all ,
but what i am saying
is true.also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead .
it is a shame really
that she has become stuck in the `` tough girl '' typecasting now ,
because that is really not what her part in `` girlfight '' is all about .
sure she is a female boxer ,
but rather it is the more sensitive moment
that really makes her shine.so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist ,
but it is lifted way above the crowd by rodriguez ' performance .
i rate this 7/10 .
