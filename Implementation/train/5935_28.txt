man of honor feature cuba gooding jr. ,
in what is probably his best performance to date .
he plays carl brashear 
a man of towering courage and heroism .
he is a poor dirt farmer from the south ,
who wants to become a navy diver-
but has problem
because of his race .
the head of the diving school ,
played by robert deniro ,
is a racist redneck
that nonetheless grows to respect brashear .
the film is about how brashear has to concur the nearly insurmountable odd 
not once but twice .
the performance are what make this film special .
gooding is great ,
and deniro 
the best actor in movie history 
gives a towering performance- his best dramatic work in year .
charlize theron gives another solid performance as deniro 's much younger wife .
the film lays on the patriotism a little too strong
( though no where near the level
it was in the patriot ) ,
and a few of the character are just one dimansionally bad
( hal holook 's mr. pappy is just so evil ) ,
but the film is a rarity among film today .
it is uplifting and uncynical .
a wonderful film .
