i am a massive fan of the book and orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever
since studying animal farm at gcse .
i bought the dvd out of sheer curiosity ,
burton is an actor i hold in high regard
so
when i heard
that he played the role of o'brien i was swung.i watched the trailer on the dvd first
and some fear
started to set in ,
mostly regarding the frankly terrible `` theme song '' ,
hearing the eurythmic mechanically shouting `` 1984 ! ''
over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad
as it sounds.the acting on a whole is pretty good ,
burton and hurt play their role well and the tension
that exists in the ministry of truth towards the end can be felt 
especially in the harrowing room 101 scene .
however this is also where the movie is let down .
the movie spends too much time
focusing on the love affair between winston and julia ,
which frankly is not what orwell was writing about .
he was writing about a harrowing future ,
about how ingsoc build up a man belief and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love big brother .
the movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book ,
winston coming to term with his position in life and the world ,
and his re-education via o'brien.the comment on imdb at the moment states
that the movie sticks to the book
is completely incorrect .
julia is not present
when winston visits o'brien 
they do not commit themselves to goldstien 's brotherhood and confess their crime .
there is no obvious mention of the initial instance where winston finds the article with the unperson
but it does get mentioned near the end ,
if you have not read the book
it is completely confusing.a terrible screenplay ,
which some excellent acting can not rescue .
michael radford seems to have completely missed
the point orwell was trying to make ,
and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible .
