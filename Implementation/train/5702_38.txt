when i saw the previews for this movie ,
i did not expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie .
but wow 
this movie was absolutely awful .
and that is being generous.first of all ,
the casting for the movie was terrible .
you feel no sympathy
( or for that matter any morbid feeling )
for the character .
the acting was so terrible
that i was just simply waiting
and hoping for the god-awful thing to end.secondly ,
there are point in the movie
that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever .
can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming `` pancake ! ! ! ''
at the top of his lung
while going into jackie chan move i
have never seen before ,
and even further biting the guy
who has the virus ?
why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy ,
and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ?
i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief
that i literally said out loud ,
`` where the hell did that come from ?
`` i just simply could not believe
what i had seen .
i really thought
i had seen some bad movie ,
but i have to say
that cabin fever tops them all .
this movie made me want to puke and then puke again .
then blow my ain out.please 
save yourself an hour and a half
and do something more productive .
watching grass grow 
perhaps 
is a proper alternative .
