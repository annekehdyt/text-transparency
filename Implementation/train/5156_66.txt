in a woman under the influence mabel goes crazy ,
but i can see why
she does go crazy .
if i lived the kind of life
she lived with the family
she has i
would go crazy too .
everyone in her family is off their rocker
and not completely with it .
she is constantly surrounded by person
yelling at her
and telling her what is best for herself and person
that are not the sharpest knifes in the drawer.to start with the one person closest to her in her life ,
her husband 
nick 
is a little off his rocker .
he is always yelling at her
when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile .
the rest of the time he is working long hour at his job
and he is not there to support her
when she needs support .
the one person in her life
that should always be there for her is never there
and if he is ,
he is just making her feel worse .
she relies on him for support
and always goes to him first
when she feels
she is acting wrong
and he does nothing to support her .
when she comes home from the hospital all
he does is tell her how to act ,
instead of comforting her ,
he just yells at her
and tells her what to do.the other major person in her life are her parent .
her parent do nothing in her life for her .
mabel basically runs their life
because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her .
in the end
she even asks her father to stand up for her and he
does not understand ,
and when he does get
it he still does nothing .
they do nothing to help mabel recover
or to keep her from going crazy
because they do nothing for her period .
the only person
that tries to do something for her is nick 's mom .
nick 's mom is adamant about having mabel committed .
she does not want to have nick deal with it so
she has the doctor commit her .
it seems as
though everyone is against mabel
and they feel
that
having her committed is a good idea
because then they will not have to deal with it anymore .
they all want to live their own life
and do nothing for mabel except for yell at her and make her feel
like she is doing something wrong
when she really is not .
that is why
she went crazy ,
and why
she had to be committed ,
it was her family 's entire fault .
