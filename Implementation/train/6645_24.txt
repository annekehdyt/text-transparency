as a huge fan of the original 
i avoided this film like the plague
when the bad review started coming in eight year ago ,
but i just finished watching this film
and found it to be a really pleasant surprise.okay ,
if you are looking for a retread of the original ,
you are in for a big disappointment ,
but if you are looking for something quite different ,
a bit edgy and political 
then this is the film for you .
gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school ,
where he is being pursued by a fellow teacher
and having sexual dream about one of his student .
when the student insists on meeting up with gregory 
a series of misadventure ensue
that include torture 
eaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twist
and turns
that left me feeling elated and moved.if you are looking for something original ,
then i highly recommend this film .
i only wish
that more person had gone to see this
when it was released
and seen it for what it really is .
