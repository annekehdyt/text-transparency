this movie was a classic .
i would have to say
that this movie caught the best of a working man
who learns from his mistake .
if we could all get along
and learn the way
everyone in this movie did .
it had an important part of showing
how family is an important part of life ,
and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life
if we can not find a `` big throat ''
and swallow are pride .
