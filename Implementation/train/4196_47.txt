this is the single worst movie i
have ever seen .
let me say
that again :
this is the single worst movie i
have ever seen.it had all of the ear-mark of a bad movie :
continuity error 
bad writing 
bad acting 
bad production value 
bad music .
i thought
that there were a couple point to horror movie .
the first is that
it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you .
this movie gets and f in this category .
the second point is that
when a character dy 
or something bad happens to them ,
we are supposed to care .
this movie gets an f in this regard as well .
the first story 
a woman gets mauled by wolf
after being afraid
that this would happen to her .
the next story 
an ocd guy dy from not being careful and talk to a dead friend of his .
oh ,
and then there is the horrific 
nail-biting story of a bad roommate .
come on ,
could you pick topic a little more interesting and a little less common
than being alone in a house ,
being anal-retentive ,
and having a roommate ?
turns out all of these story
where hallucination 
virtual reality induced by a doctor
who in turn uses
it himself .
wow 
stupid.let me explain something ,
i enjoy watching bad horror movie and laughing at how bad they are .
i could not do that with this one .
it was utter pain to sit and watch .
do not under any circumstance watch this movie .
you will regret it .
