if you hate redneck accent ,
you will hate this movie .
and to make it worse ,
you see patrick swayze ,
a has been trying to be a redneck .
i really can not stand redneck accent .
i like billy bob thornton 
he was good in slingblade ,
but he was annoying in this movie .
and what kind of name is lonnie earl ?
how much more hickish can this movie get ?
the storyline was stupid .
i am usually not this judgemental of movie ,
but i could not stand this movie .
if you want a good billy bob thornton movie ,
go see slingblade.my mom
found this movie for $ 5.95 at wal mart ... figure ...
i think
i will wrap it up
and give it to my grandma for christmas .
it could just be that i can not stand redneck accent usually ,
or that i can not stand patrick swayze .
maybe if patrick swayze was not in it .
i did not laugh once in the movie .
i laugh at anything stupid usually .
if they had shown someone finger getting smashed ,
i might have laughed .
person 's finger
getting smashed by accident
always makes me laugh .
