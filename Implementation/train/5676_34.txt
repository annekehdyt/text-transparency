let me start out by saying
i will try not to put too many spoiler in this .
normally i enjoy robin williams movie ,
however this gem was not one of them .
it was billed as a suspenseful thriller .
the night listener was anything but .
to be blunt there were 6 person in the theater opening day ,
2 walked out 
for good reason .
the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed .
the acting was alright but again there was not anything to work with .
the movie is about a storyteller
who reads a good book by a dying kid .
however *insert spooky here* no one can verify the kid existence .
so williams goes to wisconsin
to try and find the author ,
however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boy caretaker .
there thats it 
thats all .
you wait for about an hour and a half and movie end .
it had as many thrill and chill as a dentist office visit .
the homosexual undertone 
or overtone had really nothing to do with the story ,
and the movie had a little profanity
but it seemed to be thrown in there
for absolutely no reason
and made little sense .
in conclusion i really can not write a decent review on this film
because there was nothing to it ,
it was as captivating as watching paint dry .
i gave it a 2
because the acting for what it was worth
was alright
and it was not directed by uwe boll .
