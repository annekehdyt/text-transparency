after seeing
you have got mail and feeling disappointed ,
i decided to see the original movie
which inspired this one ,
the shop around the corner .
i was amazed at this movie .
it is a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movie of all time .
the acting is so perfect ,
the story is so beautiful ,
that
if you have not seen it ,
i wish to urge you to see it today .
i am not against re-make and sometime i like the new version more than the original one ,
but this time have to admit
that you have got mail is a poor adaption of this classic .
do not miss it ,
go to your video store and rent the shop
around the corner today !
