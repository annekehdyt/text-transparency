the pilot is extremely well done .
it lays out how the character bond in future episode .
i do not think
anyone could have created a better pilot for this show .
it displays remarkable creativity on the writer part .
although not everything was straightened out
because it was the very first episode 
a lot of event
that happen in future season
were demonstrated in the pilot .
an example would be ross and rachel future relationship .
even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared ,
it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.bravo.a great start to an unbeatable comedy !
