i love henry jame book and washington square was no exception .
i was very excited to see a new movie coming out ,
based on the book of that title .
jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough
to play the lead role .
albert finney is miscast
and does not carry the role well .
i wanted to shoot maggie smith ... .or rather her silly 
insipid role .
the real problem
and what is lacking in this latest version
is a good script 
music ,
and direction.i fell asleep in the theater watching this long ,
drawn out and exceptionally boring movie .
there are more pause in the dialog than a pinter play .
in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine sloper and her life .
the movie had just the opposite effect .
i also disliked the twist
where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris .
eeeeeeeek .
yuk.watch it
if you can not sleep ,
it is a definite snoozer .
do not watch it
if you are depressed .
you will need zoloft after this.sure ,
`` the heiress '' was exceptional with olivia haviland and montgomery clift in the title role .
the actor
who played her father
was on the mark as the uncaring 
cold father ... .still grieving for his dead wife and hating catherine for it .
the movie was not faithful to the book
but neither is this one.this movie was a box office flop .
i have no doubt as to why .
