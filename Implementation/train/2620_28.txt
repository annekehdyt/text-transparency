i love the book 
`` jane eyre ''
and have seen many version of it .
all have their strong point and their fault .
however 
this was one of the worst i have seen .
i did not care about jane or mr. rochester .
charlotte gainsbourg
( jane )
was almost tolerable
and certainly looked the plain part ,
but she had no emotion in any of her line .
i could not imagine what mr. rochester saw in her .
that ings us to mr. rochester .
william hurt had even less emotion than jane ,
if that were possible .
how two such insipid person could fall in love is a mystery ,
but it certainly did not hold my attention .
perhaps the director
( zeffrelli )
fell asleep during the production.the timothy dalton
( too handsome for mr .
rochester ! )
version is far more faithful to the book ,
but ciaran hind plays the perfect mr. rochester in the 1997 a/e version
( which is not all that true to the book )
.trying to find something positive about this movie :
geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role .
