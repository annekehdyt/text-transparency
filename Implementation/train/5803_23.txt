great cast .
great acting .
unpredictable story line for the first halfhour or so .
i was really wanting to know what was going tohappen to each of these unredeeming character ,
and how theirseemingly disparate life would become intertwined .
but whenthe writer took out the glue
to start connecting the player ,
theymistakenly used super glue
and ought the movie to a standstillfor the last two hour .
i kept thinking
it would get better ,
but it onlygot worse .
do not believe the review .
this is a waste of time .
think about it
-- tom cruise made ugly --
why ?
the gorgeoushunky bartender wearing ace
-- why ?
i know
it had to do withthe plot ,
but without them ,
at least there would have been oneattractive cast member to remember .
