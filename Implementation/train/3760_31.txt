i will admit
that i do not expect much from a roger corman film .
generally 
i expect a lot of walking and bad script .
yet in this case ,
i am pleasantly surprised.the gunslinger is a story of a woman
( played by the spunky beverly garland )
who takes over as sheriff
after her husband is utally murdered .
ms. garland is a pretty good shot herself ,
killing one of the murderer the next day at her husband 's funeral .
her first task is to shut down the local bar
that is violating the town curfew .
the bar 's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation
of being bought out by the ( hoped-for ) railroad .
however 
ms. garland is a thorn in her plan ,
and the bar matron hires a man
to kill ms. garland.because of ms. garland 's play her role honestly and realistically ,
there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somer
`` she is the sheriff '' joke .
with the exception of a couple of faux pas
( the apartment door
that opens out from the inside 
jeep track ,
and the two horseman waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner ) ,
the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare .
however 
corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scene ,
much like he does walking in other films.sterno says
the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time .
