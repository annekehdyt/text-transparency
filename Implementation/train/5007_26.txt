`` panic in the street '' is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan
and was made before his classic masterpiece such as `` a streetcar named desire '' 
`` on the waterfront '' and `` east of eden '' .
kazan already won an oscar in 1947 ,
before this movie ,
so he was not a completely unknown at the time .
still `` panic in the street '' is mostly a movie
that passed under the radar.the great thing
about this movie is the oscar winning script .
it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir element .
the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent
and gives the movie a feel
of reality and credibility.the cast is fairly unknown
( especially at the time it was released )
but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie role .
especially palance impress as the tough gangster boss 
with a very powerful looking face.still the movie drags a little at some point .
the movie starts of very well
but after the start
the movie slows down
and does not always makes the right decision in term of pace
and the point of view the story is told from.yet ,
`` panic in the street '' remains a perfectly watchable movie ,
mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog
that makes the movie a believable one to watch .
for fan of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.8/10
