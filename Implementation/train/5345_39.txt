i am both amused and disgusted by the person
who claim
that this movie is so accurate about vietnam ,
and were never there .
this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war
as the rodney king beating is true about all police officer .
yes 
bad thing do
( and did ) happen ,
but in general the person there are just like you and me .
they have moral ,
they are not killing machine ,
they do not all do drug .
atrocity were the exception in vietnam 
not the rule .
they happened far more infrequently
than the `` hype '' would lead you believe .
oliver stone has a knack
for making movie
that show the vietnam war as this utal bloodbath ,
but are based as much in reality as star war .
if you honestly believe
the stereotype of vietnam ,
do yourself a favour
and learn the truth .
fact :
the viet cong and nva did far worse thing to the south vietnamese than any soldier in the us armed force ever did .
fact :
the soldier in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldier in vietnam did ,
and they were welcomed
when they came home .
the fine american
who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect ;
though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint ,
no one could have asked for more from our soldier ,
and it is a great disservice
to assert
that this kind of `` mostly true '' fiction is the way
thing really were there .
