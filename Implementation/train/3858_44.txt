maybe you should not compare ,
but wild style and style war are original hip hop .
beat street does have a lot of the original artist of early hip hop ,
but they have been obviously made clear
that this could be their big eak ,
of course for some it was
and that is nice .
but if you view this as original hip hop culture
you are wrong .
it is overproduced
and has a hollywood sauce .
rather look for the first two movie i mentioned .
they have convey the grittiness
that comes with life in the ghetto .
yes 
the rating for this movie is low ,
but the review are mostly positive or even raving .
this is probably
because although the story 
the acting 
the dialogue and the direction all are dreadful ,
the music and dancing is what the person love about it .
me 
i do love the dancing
but at the time thought
that electro was the death of hip hop
( i was so glad
when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artist appeared 
like krs one 
public enemy 
ultramagnetic mc 's 
jungle brother 
bizmarkie to name a few ) ,
and i still do not like most of the beat in this movie
and that is why
it does not work for me .
i mean 
wild style has not much of a story
but the music there is great and authentic .
of course taste differ
and that is alright .
but as far as i am concerned ,
this movie is trash except for the eak dancing and some of the music
and so i can not rate it higher than a 4 out of ten .
