frailty
-- 8/10 --
it is non-sensical title and `` bill paxton direct '' headline aside ,
this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller .
in the end 
it may end up only being the ined southern gothic cousin of kuick 's `` the shining ''
-- -but hey 
that is a pretty damn entertaining notion .
it is also got a doozy of a plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message .
this is the kind of movie
that year from now person will catch late at night on basic cable
and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it .
too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to star ... oh well ... .still a devil of a good rent .
