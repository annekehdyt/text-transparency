well 
`` cube ''
( 1997 ) ,
vincenzo 's first movie 
was one of the most interesting and tricky idea
that i have ever seen
when talking about movie .
they had just one scenery 
a bunch of actor and a plot .
so 
what made it
so special were all the effective direction 
great dialog and a bizarre condition
that character had to deal like rat in a labyrinth .
his second movie 
`` cypher ''
( 2002 ) ,
was all about its story ,
but it was not so good as `` cube ''
but here are the character
being tested like rat again .
`` nothing '' is something very interesting
and gets vincenzo coming back to his 'cube day ' ,
locking the character once again in a very different space with no time
once more
playing with the character like
playing with rat in an experience room .
but instead of a thriller sci-fi
( even some of the promotional teaser and trailer erroneous seemed like that ) ,
`` nothing '' is a loose and light comedy
that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society
and also about the intolerant world we are living .
once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea
into a so small kind of thing .
2 actor and a blinding white scenario 
that is all
you got most part of time
and you do not need more than that .
while `` cube '' is a claustrophobic experience and `` cypher '' confusing ,
`` nothing '' is completely the opposite
but at the same time also desperate.this movie proves once again
that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget .
of course
that the movie fails sometimes ,
but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaw .
there is nothing more to be said about this movie
because everything is a illiant surprise and a totally different experience
that i had in movie since `` cube '' .
