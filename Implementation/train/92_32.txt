i love the doodlebop .
my son has been watching them for over a year .
we went to the doodlebop concert last year as well as one concert yesterday
( connecticut ) .
he loves them .
the doodlebop do not teach the alphabet or number
but who cares ?
are you being serious ?
the tv is not suppose to teach your child about number or the alphabet .
the parent should .
get over it .
the doodlebop actually can sing .
deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert
you can tell
all 3 of them have nice singing voice
and do not lip sing .
imagine 
they dance 
jump around and still sing .
they have talent ,
the kid love them i even enjoy watching the show .
this show is by far the best show on tv for kid .
and a rock band for child .
how amazing is that ?
why are person saying chad
( rooney )
is gay ?
where did you hear that from ?
whether he is or not ,
he is awesome !
leave him alone .
its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our child !
