i love this freekin movie !
walsh is a true master of the cinematic form ,
his film have been sometimes in my opinion 
overlooked .
but this film is a favourite of mine
because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\\all the wonderful character that existed 
the lifestyle 
the mode of dress 
the way
they spoke ,
ok they might be exaggerated ,
but it is good to know
that there were occasion
when two man tried to outdo each other with insane stunts.i
just felt
it was apiece of history
that should be wathced by many person and appreciated
because of that fact.can i get it somewhere on dvd ?
i have only seen it on tv .
but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie
about that period of time this is the perfect one .
