i am amazed
how many comment on this show are about how `` real '' it is .
maybe i am not part of the same universe
because
if veronica mar is anything ,
it is over the top in a big way.the acting
is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm
and the plot have hole
you could drive a truck through .
that is not what i call real.it is so earnest in its desire
to be `` relevant ''
that it only shows how cut-off from reality rob thomas and his staff are.overall ,
i found it to be at best a snooze-fest and at worst more than a little annoying .
kristen bell look like
she could be a good actress ,
but it is hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole show .
