i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s .
it was well presented
but i do remember
there was a message of hope oadcast from transmitter secreted in lampost in one of the last maniacal execution for impending liberation .
i am not sure
that squares with the facts.still the film is well done .
the german high command report wryly
without emotion `` the russian
are advancing down the fredrich strasse ''
as if all went according to plan.it was my impression
that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper 's account by a similar title last day of hitler .
i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper.i agree
the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic .
the american knock-off was a little flat.few figure
have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph .
yet i find it interesting that none of the many film and book
that have come out ever speak of hitler 's double alluded to in passing in john toland 's magnificent historical piece.was gibs ?
