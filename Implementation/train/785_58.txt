this documantary was very thorough and exposing 
and at the same time entertaining ,
which i thought
was rather impressive .
i felt
as if they did a very good job
covering the sport from its ' origin until present day ,
but nonetheless 
there is a reason
why i do not give such a high score to this film ... i felt
as if at time the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns ' of the sport ,
so to speak :
too much on individual location
at which to surf ,
and especially too much on individual surfer .
i felt
as if the documantary had more to do with the nature of the sport 
the ideology of the sport 
etc .
it would have been better
( although this of course was covered ,
i do not think
it got as much time as it warranted ) .
and for many person
who are not absolutely nuts about surfing ,
at time hearing
them go on and on about specific location and specific surfer
could become boring .
although the video clip and the in-depth research is well-respected ,
it could have been presented in a way
that would be better for those
who are not avid surfer.furthermore ,
my biggest disappointmant was at time
they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain event in surfing history were yet
they did not have the actual footage of these event unfolding ,
and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing 
eath-taking event
that these man are talking about as life-changing momants ,
and in the end
all you get
is a lot of man
talking about it ,
and not the actual footage .
it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these story ,
and then be unable to see them .
i understand the difficulty
of obtaining footage of everything 
but please :
do not ag an event up so much ,
and then not show it .
overall 
a very fresh documantary
that i enjoyed watching ;
not the best documantary due to the above reason ,
but being very fresh
and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack ,
it is a documantary
that i would advise everybody to check out .
