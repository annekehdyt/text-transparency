what a bad movie .
i am really surprised
that deniro and even snipe would be associated with something like this .
if you are going to make a movie
that involves baseball 
and shows scene of baseball 
at least make the action look somewhat realistic .
why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during game ?
***possible spoiler*** and the last scene in the movie ... .what was that ?
we are somehow led to believe
that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire 's uniform ,
and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour ... .one of the worst ever scene in a sport movie .
3 star out of 10 .
