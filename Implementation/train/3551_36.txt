this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film-making may not `` open '' you up ,
to borrow one of the film 's favorite verbs ,
but it might leave your jaw slack
and your belly sore from laughter or retching .
based on the best-selling book by jame redfield 
first
( self )
published in 1993 ,
this cornucopia of kitsch track the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher
( matthew settle )
who 
on traveling to deepest 
darkest 
phoniest peru and sniffing either the air
or something else more illegal .
namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombie
who may be nut or just heavily medicated ,
perhaps
because they are often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir .
although there is a lot of talk about `` energy 
''
that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast
whose number
include thomas kretschmann 
annabeth gish 
hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow ,
all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon .
for those
who care ,
the plot involves the military 
terrorist and the roman catholic church ;
armand mastroianni provided the inept direction
while mr. redfield 
barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script .
in short 
easily the worst film seen in 40+ year of viewing movie .
