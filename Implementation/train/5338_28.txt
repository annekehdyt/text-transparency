this movie is a fantastic movie .
everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing .
i know
mr. garfield was blacklisted in the 1950 's
but the majority of his other film are on video if not dvd .
that being the case ,
why is not this one ?
a friend recorded it off of tcm for me
but to have it on dvd
would be great .
for special feature they could have say
a marine historian talk about the battle
and if mr. schmid 's wife or son are still alive
they could be interviewed as well .
anyway this is a great movie
and i highly recommend it.if
it ever is put out hopefully
it will not be colorized .
colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film .
the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 ,
film would go .
mr. garfield did a superb job of portraying mr. schmid .
some actor might have been tempted to overact the part of mr.schmid 's disability
but i feel
he got it just right .
i sincerely hope
they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marine
who sacrificed so much for us in world war two .
