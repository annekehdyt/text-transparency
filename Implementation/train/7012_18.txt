i am a rather pedestrian person 
with somewhat lowow taste .
however 
i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness .
this movie was one of my attempt .
i was in awe throughout the entire movie .
i liked it so much
that i got my own tape
so i could see it again .
this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie .
i saw it as a huge question to the viewer :
what is the depth of sacrifice
to duty one can accept ,
can be asked to accept ,
should accept ?
as a military member 
this is of course an important question to me .
this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.recommended .
