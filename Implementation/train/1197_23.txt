i found this film to be the usual french slap in america 's face .
the camera 
all too often 
focuses on fat person 
on sloppy home and on tacky rural area .
while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folk
who are introduced to the viewer 
the cinematography exploit and demeans them .
there were 
undoubtedly 
thin person
to be seen in glencoe and neat 
organized home ,
but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen .
i can only hope
that some american filmmaker will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst element .
i can assure you 
as a frequent visitor to france ,
that all is not well there .
foreign immigrant are not readily assimilated ,
thus creating severe social inequity .
but american are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriot and their envy toward the u.s. ,
so we are not likely to see film on the subject .
