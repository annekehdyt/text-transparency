the special effect of this movie are 
especially for its time 
laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way
that you can not deny their terrible existance.the acting redefine the term `` terrible overacting '' at the hand of meg foster and richard joseph paul ,
where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine `` bad '' .
***spoilers***the charm in this movie can be found in two thing :
first is the excellent casting of carel `` lurch '' struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt ,
who can sense where
and when person will die
and is always there.the second are original find ,
the combination sf-western is obviously original 
if terrible ,
but other find are more original ,
like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the person
he shoots
( though his acting fall short here )
.overal ... do not see this movie ,
except if you love that ol ' hunk-o-utal carel struycken ,
as any self-respecting dutchman should .
