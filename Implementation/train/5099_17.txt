the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn
standing in her little french cut bikini panty
and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved woman
from removing her skimpy little cotton top
while she giggled and cooed .
ooooof !
her loin rival those of nina hartley .
this movie came out
when i was fourteen
and that shot nearly killed me .
i would forgotten
about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind
until seeing it the other day on tv ,
where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene 
good grief 
reminding me what a smokin ' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80 .
kurt russell must have had a fun life .
