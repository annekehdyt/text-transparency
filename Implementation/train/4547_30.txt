incredibly intriguing and captivating 
i found it impossible to turn away
once i
began to watch .
i am usually one of the harshest critic
but to me this film was just illiant ,
strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air
and feel the texture of the location .
from a cinematographic i thought
there was great use of light and texture .
from the orange glow of the summer light 
down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me.from a character
perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the glue
that connects the story
was quite inspired 
each of the other member of the family
having a more complete background
simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself.beyond
that ,
having known someone just like the grandmother
and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation ,
i can say
the situation felt particularly realistic .
the awkwardness 
the accent 
the cooking and even down to the comment made felt so authentic to me.i think
this film worked for me
because i began to watch it with no expectation
and found it completely immersing and ought back memory of teenage emotion ,
well worth a watch .
