if you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you ,
as fare as i am concerned
it does not work for me
and after watching 3 episode i just can not watch it anymore .
it is boring and slow and for a show
that the timeline is based around 100.000+ year ago
if you base it on battlestar galactica 's timeline for arriving on earth
they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old chevy van driving down the street and person
watching the 100.000 year old popular name and lcd t.v .
set .
it also goes the same with the rest of the set as well on the show ,
there is just to much of today 's stuff
involved in it to not overlook ,
i think
they could have done a lot better of a job
to get around these issue
and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issue but not nearly as bad .
as fare as the rest of the show
it is not nearly as good as bsg was
and it is a poor pre sequel to it .
