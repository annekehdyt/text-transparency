when i first heard about the title ,
i thought of 'the simpson ' ,
just like so many other reviewer ,
but
when i saw the cast ,
i was completely stunned ,
that so many great character-actor would actually be in this !
first of all 
we have christopher walken
( deer hunter 
pulp fiction ) ,
who plays the title character 
mcbain .
he is rescued from a vietnam pow-camp by some of his buddy 
one of which is santo
( chick vennera 
yank ) ,
who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain
( vietnam soldier are loaded with cash apparently ) ,
and tells him
that he can re-do the favor to him ,
if he ever gets into trouble.then 
18 year later 
santo and his sister christina
( maria conchita alonso 
the running man 
predator 2 )
join the rebel in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator 
el presidente
( victor argo 
taxi driver 
king of new york ) ,
and
when santo fails the mission ,
christina goes to mcbain for help.mcbain then asks his good ol ' vietnam buddy to help him .
first there is the token tough black guy 
eastland ,
played by `` american ninja '' 's steve jame ,
who was also in director jame glickenhaus ' previous movie ,
`` the exterminator '' ,
where the exterminator 's real name also was eastland 
coincidence ?
i think not .
there is also a lot of other reference to the exterminator 
among other thing 
the most notable one
being that mcbain himself wears a welders-mask
when christina sees him for the first time ,
when he is working on a welding-job on top of a idge !
the other guy in the vietnam-pack are :
the rich guy
who can afford all sort of equipment for the team 
frank bruce
( michael ironside 
total recall 
starship trooper ) ,
and then there is the doc 
dalton ,
( played by jay patterson ,
who does not look like the guy
the imdb is linking to ,
and i have not seen him in other movie 
so who knows ) 
and last but not least 
there is the cop 
gill ,
who has had enough of his unsatisfying job ,
he is played by thomas g. waite ,
who some of us might remember from the warrior and the thing.and in other big role ,
we find luis guzm\u00e1n
( boogie night 
carlito 's way ) ,
as a small-time drug-dealer
who can not get a decent job .
also 
there is dick boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin
who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain-gang ,
almost exactly in the same way
he got hung up over a meat-grinder by john eastland in the exterminator-movie !
now 
i have not seen glickenhaus ' `` shakedown/blue jean cop '' yet ,
but i am almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill
that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too !
well 
back to the plot of this movie.. they go off to colombia and saves the day 
yay !
but who cares about the plot anyway ,
the cast is great ,
and the action-scene are very well done ,
and you are never bored
while watching this movie !
highly recommended to all action-lover !
