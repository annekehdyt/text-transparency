there was not a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon
after i left the cinema ,
having seen this gem of a film in a sold-out house as part of this year 's hamburg film festival .
and the tear shed were all of laughter .
this film was hilarious ,
there is no other way
of saying this .
there was not one boring bit in it 
i laughed right through it and with me everyone
else of us three hundred lover of french cin\u00e9ma.alain chabat was absolutely terrific .
a great clown if need be and serious
if the situation calls for it .
the performance was of course completely over the top ,
but this was exactly what the story needed
and what made it work so well .
equally great was charlotte gainsbourg
who i love to see a lot ,
and the mother was also a very strong performance .
the sister could have been a bit more detailed in character script-wise ,
but apart from that there is nothing to moan about .
i had a great afternoon
seeing this film
while hamburg was drowning in rain outside ,
and i wish film
like this from france would get a regular release in germany .
but the distributor is this country do not seem to understand
that the french make good film .
i at least can not wait to find a dvd
which offers subtitle
( hello australia ?
please ? )
because that film i need at home to watch several more time !
