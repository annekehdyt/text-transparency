this movie has great star in their earlier year :
ingor stevens never looked prettier ;
yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte 
conflicted about his piracy and desiring
to keep neutrality with the united state .
charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson ,
but some moment were a bit stilted .
it is really a good flick for student
to learn that part of our history ,
and it shows
that all happy ending do not include the lover
getting together with each other
-- sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partner of similar background
who will understand them better in the long run .
i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 year now ;
and though it is not the best movie i have ever seen ,
i love it every time !
