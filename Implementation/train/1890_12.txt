higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us
that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background .
it is a subject most of us would like to ignore
but we can not afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way
we have to be able emace
and understand diversity.some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is 
ignorance reign supreme in the world and several continue
to help it dominate our society.everyone
involved in this film
has done a good deed in showing what step must continue to be done
in order to not have to make anymore film like higher learning.sure it sounds like a pipe dream
but we have to start somewhere and this helps .
