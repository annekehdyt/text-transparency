last weekend i bought this 'zombie movie ' from the bargain bin
and watched it with some friend
thinking
it was going to be a budget version of `` land of the dead '' .boy ,
was i wrong .
it seems
as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art ,
which is very misleading to fan of the zombie genre.we watched up to the point
where the zombie chicks come alive
and get in the car with some yuppie
who is out in the middle of nowhere
talking business on a cell-phone .
they actually speak to the guy before one of the girl kills him ;
but
once they started driving the car ,
i could not suspend my disbelief anymore.some person
actually consider this a `` so bad ,
it is good '' movie ,
they are liar .
i did not finish the movie ,
but one of the other review mention
that they actually somehow become police officer at the end of the movie ,
which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through.this is even worse than `` zombiez '' do not watch !
