poorly written conspiracy drama/mystery about the possibility
that aid was introduced to the public by the government .
wlaschiha plays a gay researcher
looking for answer
-- that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find .
despite the cinematography itself being commendable ,
the camera hunger for character of true depth instead of the shallow 
amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey .
grade :
d+
