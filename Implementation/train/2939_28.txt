this move was on tv last night .
i guess as a time filler ,
because it sucked bad !
the movie is just an excuse
to show some tit and ass at the start
and somewhere about half way .
( not bad tit and ass though ) .
but the story is too ridiculous for word .
the `` wolf '' ,
if that is what you can call it ,
is hardly shown fully save his tooth .
when it is fully in view ,
you can clearly see
they had some intern working on the cgi ,
because the wolf runs like he is running in a treadmill ,
and the cgi fur looks like it is been waxed 
all shiny : )
the movie is full of gore and blood ,
and you can easily spot
who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next .
even if you like these kind of splatter movie
you will be disappointed ,
they did not do a good job at it.do
not even get me started on the actor ... very corny line and the girl scream at everything about every 5 second .
but then again ,
if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few buck 
then hey ,
where do i sign up ? overall boring and laughable horror .
