the first half was ok ,
but the last half really 
really disappointed .
it is funny the producer even admitted
they did not have a clue for the ending ,
and it really showed .
what really sad is i have to write ten line of comment minimum
to be able to post this .
i really did not want to include spoiler to qualify my remark
since the show is not really worth that effort .
when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake ,
it did not happen that first season border
on being space porn .
they eventually cleaned it up a bit
and actually had some pretty fair drama ,
so i started watching again .
but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel ,
same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .
