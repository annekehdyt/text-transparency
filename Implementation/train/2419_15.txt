the costume and make-up were grand ,
there were some exceptionally funny line ,
and the role was made for jim carrey .
carrey did as good a job
as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing .
sure this was mostly a movie for kid ,
but if you are going to spend this much money
making a movie
you really ought to at least give the story enough body
to go beyond that of dr seuss .
i expected more from ron howard .
it is worth a see ,
but it lacks the necessary quality
to become a major classic 
by any measure .
