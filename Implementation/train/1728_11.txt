ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical 1950 's teen in turmoil movie .
it is not a horror or science fiction movie .
plot concern a group of teen
who are about to get kicked out of their `` hot rod '' club
because they can not meet the rent .
once kicked out ,
they decide to try an old haunted house .
the only saving grace for the film is that the `` ghost ''
( paul blaisdell in the she creature suit )
turns out to be an out of work movie monster
played by blaisdell .
