i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan
so
when the sci-fi channel ran this movie ,
i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she does not wear the right costume [
she must have refused to or had ordered major change ] and the plot runs like a poor man 's jame bond.there is none of the thing
that made the comic book heroine a success i.e .
the superhuman strength or determined will.it is just one long bad dream.i do not even think
cathy is all that attractive anyway.i would not waste your time on this .
