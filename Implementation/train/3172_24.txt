the film is almost laughable with debbie reynold and shelley winter teaming up as the mother of convicted murderer .
with the horrible notoriety after the trial 
the two woman team up and leave n.y. for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple-like girls.from the beginning ,
it becomes apparent
that reynold has made a mistake in taking winter with her to california .
winter plays a deeply religious woman
who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker .
to make matter worse 
the woman
who live together ,
are receiving menacing phone call .
reynold ,
who puts on a blond wig ,
is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her student ,
nicely
played by dennis weaver.agne moorehead 
in one of her last film ,
iefly is seen as sister alma ,
who winter is a faithful listener of.the film really belongs to shelley winter .
she is heavy here
and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better .
winter always did well in role testing her nerves.the ending is of the macae
and who can forget winter at the piano banging away
with that totally insane look ?
