this film is fantastic .
finally well-written character
you can love for all their good and bad .
pierce brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role .
i think
its the best thing he is ever done .
he is done other role
that exhibited shade of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work ,
but this role finally gave him the room
to run with it .
i almost died
when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boot .
and greg kinnear and hope davi are a couple
to aspire too ,
as well as actor to aspire too .
kinnear is so goofy likable
that his turn in the end is truly gratifying .
you give good actor good work
to play with and they give us something more back .
