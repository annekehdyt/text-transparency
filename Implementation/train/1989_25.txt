i just do not understand
why this movie is getting beat-up in here .
jeez .
it is mindless ,
it is not polished
and it is ( as i am reading )
wasted on some .
the cast of this movie plays their character to the 't '
( if you watched permanent midnight
and became a ben stiller fan then yes
you will be disappointed ) .
these are misunderstood 
well-intentioned misfit trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination .
the problem is they do not realize their limit until the big showdown
and that is the point !
this is 3 time the movie
that the spy
who shagged me
was yet gets panned by the same demographic group ,
likely the same person
who feel the first ap movie pale in comparison to the sequel .
i just do not get it .
the joke work on more then one level ;
if you did not get it i know
what level you are at .
