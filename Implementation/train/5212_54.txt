charle mcdougall 's resume includes directing episode on 'sex and the city ' 
'desperate housewife ' 
queer as folk ' 
'big love ' 
'the office ' 
etc .
so he comes with all the credential
to make the tv film version of meg wolitzer 's novel surrender 
dorothy a success .
and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner
in which the person in her life react afloat.sara
( alexa davalos )
a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friend - gay playwright adam
( tom everett scott ) ,
adam 's current squeeze shawn
( chris pine ) ,
and married couple maddy
( lauren german )
and peter
( josh hopkin )
with their infant son - to a house in the hampton for a summer vacation .
the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara )
result in an auto accident
which kills sara .
meanwhile sara 's mother natalie swedlow
( diane keaton )
who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting 'surrender 
dorothy ' ,
is playing it up elsewhere :
when she receives the phone call
that sara is dead
she immediately comes to the hampton
where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among sara 's friend .
slowly but surely natalie uncover secret about each of them 
thriving on talking about sara
as though doing so would ing her to life .
natalie 's thirst for truth at any cost
result in major change among the group
and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara
that
they all eventually come together.diane keaton is at her best in these role
that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together .
the screenplay has its moment for good line ,
but it also has a lot of filler
that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actor obviously uncomfortable with the line
they are given .
yes 
this story has been told many time
- the impact of sudden death on the life of those
whose privacy is altered by disclosure -
but the film move along with a cast pace
and has enough genuine entertainment
to make it worth watching .
