i loved the movie ,
but like everyone said ,
there were some bit
that were not developed enough .
i thought personally
that the girl were very vapid
before they landed in prison ;
sure 
they were supposed to be innocent american girl
but still ... i felt like they lacked
that bond that best friend are supposed to have .
for example 
in the montage where they are sight-seeing ,
the way
they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.then ,
there are some part
that were very ambiguous .
i think
it is pretty much understood
that dane ' character did not do it ,
but i can see how that could be confusing .
also 
why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression
after he put the bag in their taxi trunk ?
i thought
it was suggesting something ,
but it turned out to be nothing.apart from that ,
the movie was great .
i cried
when claire dane took the blame ;
she is a great actress.also ,
i wanted to see
that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked .
talk about lack of closure ...
