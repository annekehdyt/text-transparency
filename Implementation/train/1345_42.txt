i remember watching this on prime time
when i was about 7 year old .
i was a huge comic book reader at the time ,
and anything relating to superhero was anticipated heavily .
the end result 
however 
was underwhelming.i was aware of the `` emma peel '' diana prince story ,
as they had only recently come to an end
and diana was returned to her amazonian form .
however 
there was so little action
that i was bored throughout most of the movie .
the final costume was an interesting idea ,
but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero.i saw the movie again in my late teen year .
it had not improved much .
cathy lee crosby was more familiar 
thank to that is incredible ,
but her acting was no better .
the script had a few good idea 
like the rogue amazon 
and a decent villain in ricardo montalban ,
but it just did not come together
and was still boring.i think
they should have built the back story better ,
and built the show into a more epic climax .
it was too much like a bland spy film 
crossed with a superhero story
written by someone
who had never seen a comic book .
the amazon element were intriguing ,
but needed to be expanded.the film
did succeed
in forcing producer to go back to the drawing board
and come up with something more faithful 
if a bit too camp and low budget .
the budget was also pretty low here ,
and superhero do not come cheap.it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd 
if only as a comparison and historical document .
even superman 4 is available ,
and it has nothing over this film
( except chris reeve and gene hackman ) .
it is worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future version .
