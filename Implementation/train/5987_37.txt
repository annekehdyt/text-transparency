max had the v-8 
trace
( wheel of fire last and only hero )
has a jet engine on the back of his car
allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces
as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland .
be amazed as mad max 2
( aka the road warrior )
is dissected and spliced back together
as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actor and lousy stunt work.why is wof set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland ?
simple 
the road warrior was !
actually any question can be answered by :
it was that way in the road warrior !
except for the out of work mutant actor from the original 60 's the time machine film
that make a cameo appearance for sake
of giving the audience some non-vehicular action
to chew on for a few minutes.in typical 80 's fashion ,
all car
driven by bad guy
that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion .
inevitably all car chase will happen near convenient cliff side and car will unavoidably fall off of them .
along with this 80 's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film .
generally i waited for trace 's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flame
so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face
like he is supposed to be tough ,
which comes off more as him looking constipated .
badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting
makes this film a true sinker .
the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.rat :
night of terror by bruno mattei is superior .
and that in and of itself is saying a lot !
by this count 2020 texas gladiator is a cinematic masterpiece
compared to wheel of fire .
a poor road warrior knock off
that does not have near enough cheese factor
to make the film watchable .
