when `` good time '' premiered in 1974 ,
it was one the first black family sitcom .
it centered on the poor chicago-based evan family and their struggle
to make end .
most of the early episode focused on the parent 
jame and florida evan 
and their struggle
to provide for the family .
john amos and esther rolle were the best part of the show .
they were terrific actor
and had great chemistry as jame and florida evan .
they had three kid :
j.j. 
thelma 
and michael .
j.j. was the skirt-chasing but well-meaning teenage son
who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent .
thelma was an attractive 
ight girl
who was constantly trading insult with j.j. michael
was a near child prodigy
who was well-educated on social issue
and was destined to become a lawyer.in 1976 ,
the producer made a huge mistake by firing john amos ,
literally killing off his character .
this really changed the focus ,
and not for the good i might add .
the show began to focus more on j.j. and his buffoon-like behavior
which angered black viewer as well as series star esther rolle ,
who left after the next season .
instead of a show
that focused on key african-american issue
that existed in society at the time ,
viewer got show
that were overloaded with skirt chasing and fat jokes.once esther rolle left ,
the quality of the show suffered even more .
although it was still watchable ,
it was no longer the great ground-eaking show
that it once was.although esther rolle came back for the 1978 season ,
it became obvious
that the show was on its last legs .
all loose end were tied up during that season and the show quietly faded off the air.first three season :
