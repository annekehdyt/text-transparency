i looked at this movie with my child eye ,
and i was not disappointed .
the story is well-known ,
some abandoned orphan has to be ought to his parent by an improbable trio
( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal ) ...
and i do not want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut .
this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.briefly :
it works ,
it is funny
and it is a `` must-see '' with your child
( they will like it ) .
