the master blackmailer ,
based off of sir arthur conan doyle 's short story 
`` the adventure of charle augustus milverton 
''
is the first feature length sherlock holme story with jeremy brett
that i have seen .
the story is interesting and dark .
the film has a somewhat dreary ,
sad feel to it ,
but it is quite entertaining
( with some especially funny scene ) .
*spoilers* sherlock holme and dr. watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer
who has been ruining some of the most prominent family of england by publishing private letter
that will 
in one way or another 
destroy their life .
they eventually find out
that he is charle augustus milverton 
an `` art dealer 
'' after the few tragic consequence for victim
that could not pay up .
our hero must next help lady eva blackwell ,
who must pay a sum
that is beyond her mean or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off .
the scene
in which holme and watson burglarize milverton 's house are intense .
although the film has an essentially happy ending ,
the tone is sad and regretful.outstanding performance by jeremy brett and edward hardwicke
( as usual ) ,
and robert hardy as the notorious villain
( most audience probably recognize him today as cornelius fudge in harry potter ) ,
serena gordon as lady eva blackwell 
norma west as lady swinstead and sophie thomson as agatha
( the scene
involving her and holme
are a riot ) .
i give it a ***1/2 out ***** .
my only complaint is that there was not enough inspector lestrade .
( i wish
they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story
where he gives the description of the two burglar ,
one of which match watson . )
