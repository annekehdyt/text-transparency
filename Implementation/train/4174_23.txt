a below average
looking video game
is turned into some sort of conspiracy
to have the next terrorist
discovered in the usa backyard .
welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movie .
its full of no-name actor and actress with little valuable plot.anyway 
this strange game goes on and our `` hero '' bet real money
and does good at it .
it is sort of like gambling ,
except the gambling part is gone
and it sucks .
instead its an online game with little real value
and you get authority on your tail
if you do good.what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer program battle it out somehow
and all is saved in the end .
i will leave the viewer
to see
how it all comes to fruition.overall ,
not even worth a $ 1 rental .
borrow it 
please .
