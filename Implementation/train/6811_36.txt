uggh !
i really was not that impressed by this film ,
though i must admit
that it is technically well made .
it does get a 7 for very high production value ,
but as for entertainment value ,
it is rather poor .
in fact 
i consider this one of the most overrated film of the 50s .
it won the oscar for best picture ,
but the film is just boring at time with so much dancing and dancing and dancing .
that is because unlike some musical
that have a reasonable number of song
along with a strong story and acting
( such as meet me in st. louis ) ,
this movie is almost all
singing and dancing .
in fact 
this film has about the longest song and dance number in history
and if you are not into this ,
the film will quickly bore you .
give me more story !
as a result 
with overblown production number and a weak story 
this film is like a steady diet of meringue
-- it just does not satisfy in the long run .
to think ... this is the film
that beat out `` a streetcar named desire ''
and `` a place in the sun '' for best picture !
and ,
to make matter worse ,
`` the african queen '' and `` ace in the hole '' were not even nominated in this category !
even more amazing to me is that `` ace in the hole '' lost for best writing 
screenplay to this film
-- even though `` an american in paris '' had hardly any story to speak of
and was mostly driven by dance and song .
