who would have thought
that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching ?
i am really impressed .
it is a shame
that more person have not seen it .
i loved 
as always 
hans zimmer 's score .
and what a directorial debut by bernard rose !
yet i wonder
if i should call this a horror film .
it could easily be argued
that it is a fantasy or a drama as well .
well 
regardless 
i love the interpretive potential
it has .
everything and everyone in anna 's
( played by charlotte burke )
dreams represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself 
the tree 
mark 
the lighthouse 
etc .
it is the many detail such as these
that make the film so good for repeated viewing .
i hope i come across another little movie
as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning
as this one some time soon .
