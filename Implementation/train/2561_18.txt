this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana
( 1995 )
and agnisakshi
( 1996 )
agnisakshi was the only one
which worked
and was a better filmdaraar
is directed by abbas mustan
who sadly failed in their attempt herethe story was good
but the handling was not that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointingdirection is bad music is goodrishi reprises his role of yaarana
( strangely
which also was a remake of swte )
and looks too fat for the lead
and is okay juhi is decent
while arbaaz try too hard in his debut
and does manage in many scene
to chill the audience
but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
