i am completely appalled to see
that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 for what affects me ,
it is definitely one of the worst movie i
have ever seen
and i still keep wondering
why i watched it until the end .
first of all 
the plot is totally hopeless ,
and the acting truly awful .
i think
that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci ;
concerning mr. kamar del 's reye ,
i think
it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his `` valley of the doll '' .
to sum up ,
it is total waste of time
( and i am trying to stay polite ... )
to avoid at any cost .
my rating is 1 and i still think
it is well paid ,
but since we can not give a o ... .
