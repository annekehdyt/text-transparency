i rarely write a negative review for this site ,
but this time felt complied to .
night listener is
without doubt one of the dullest film i have ever seen.there was nothing happening in this film
what so ever - i did not care for any of the character ,
did not buy in to the whole mystery type plot ,
did not care
how it ended ... .nothing.there is no comedy 
no action 
no thrill 
no suspense 
nothing .
the highlight include
( no spoiler -
there is nothing to spoil ) :
a man
climbing through a window ,
a dog barking outside a hotel room 
a car
going over some rough ground and a truck beeping
it is horn.i
really enjoyed `` one hour photo ''
and hoped for a similar eerie role from william ,
but ala was sorely let down .
what is more disappointing is that i am sure
there is a good film in there
somewhere -
the idea was interesting
and i should have felt sympathy for the character ,
but it just did not work for me.i might even have given it 1/10
but that score is reserved for the remake of the producer
