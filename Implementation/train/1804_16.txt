for those
who commented on the patriot
as being accurate ,
( which basically satanised the english ) ,
it was interesting to see this film .
by all account this was the bloodiest war
that american have ever been involved in ,
and they were the only nationality present .
it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic
that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours .
all in all
though what this film did ing home was the true horror of any conflict ,
and how how whatever act are committed in war only eed worse act 
often culminating in the suffering of the innocent .
this was not a film
where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all .
