i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie ,
however this was an unique case .
this movie was so bad
that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying
it would have one minute of good movie time
to justify the hour and a half
that was wasted .
needless to say
i was utally disappointed .
set at a beach house
where a group of college friend are celeating vacation ,
this movie suffers from numerous problem
making it not worth seeing .
first 
there are gaping plot hole .
second 
very few of the c-list
( i do not even dare call them b )
actor can act worth a damn 
so any scene
that have potential fail miserably .
third 
the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time
making suspense building very difficult ,
leading to very few surprise for the audience .
fourth and most importantly 
the ending is completely anti-climatic partially
because of how it ends
( setting/who the killer turns out to be )
and partially because the dialog is just atrocious .
to the film credit 
it is the only movie
that i will ever say
is the worst movie i have ever scene ,
and i have seen a lot.so 
just like a bad joke
you would have been all the happier never hearing ,
the next time someone asks you
if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no ,
you really do not as you run in the opposite direction .
