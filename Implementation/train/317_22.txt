i rarely comment on film
but i have read the other comment
and i can not believe
that there are person applauding this celluloid rubbish .
i know
there are certain person
who have their own agenda
but let take it on merit ;
poorly acted ,
badly shot and the story felt
as the director was making it up
as he was going along .
i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film
involving little kid
as the maker of the film obviously knew
what they wanted
and what their audience would want .
all i can say
is it is a terrible film ,
the content is poor and offensive ,
the production is amateurish and i am glad
they could not make a film like this legally today
