a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre
involving seductive woman
whose wile
and means entice susceptible man not only into their arm
but also into dire circumstance
that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victim 
along with incertitude
as to whether or not temptress will be forced to take their medicine ,
and here susan lucci perform as a siren ,
although her acting chop from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate
to make her performance a credible one .
isabelle
( lucci ) ,
inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collin
( john o'hurley ) ,
begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis
( philip casnoff ) ,
simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard ,
apparently mesmerized by his lover
while she takes advantage of his ardour
by engaging him in a risky plot
that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent .
when davis becomes convinced
that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband ,
he desperately attempts to free her
from what he feels is a marital trap in order
that he may wed her himself ,
coming to believe
that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimantary essay at hiring a professional assassin
who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart .
in the wake of the hit-man 's assault upon collin 
a pair of police detective ,
performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott ,
become increasingly curious concerning isabelle 's possible involvemant in the crime ,
while at the same time reality dawn upon enraptured richard
who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata 's maneuvering .
lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirator ,
each
giving a reading
that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebird ,
but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turn in a film
that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elemants .
released upon a fremantle dvd ,
this largely lustreless affair
depicting a man
'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality ,
and
although no extra feature are provided ,
the above-average production quality enhances able effort from cinematographer robert prime and composer stephen edward .
