just after the end of wwii powell and pressburger were asked to come up with something
to try to heal the rift developing between the uk and the usa .
at the time there was a lot of `` overpaid 
over sexed and over here '' type of comment .
somehow they came up with this masterpiece.my favourite movie of all time .
it is got everything .
romance 
poetry 
emotion 
religion 
drama and very quirky.i can never explain exactly why ,
but it hits all the right button
and although i have seen it hundreds of time
( yes 
really )
i am still guaranteed to be in tear at many point throughout.was
it the magnificent acting 
the wonderful set 
the inspired script ?
who knows .
but *do* watch it and you will see what i mean .
