this is the second film i have seen of ida lupino as a director after 53 's the hitch-hiker .
i think
this one was a better film
then that one .
this one has a girl
who is about to get married
and she is then sexually assaulted
and does not like everyone looking
and talking about her so she runs away
and and is taken in by a family .
i think
leonard maltin 's review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 star .
