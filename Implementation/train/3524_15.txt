jammin ' the blue is an oscar-nominated short from 1944
that is basically 10 minute of improvisational jazz played in one long jam .
marie bryant sing `` the sunny side of the street '' at one point for the film 's highlight
then jitterbugs with archie savage to ing this most entertaining `` jam session '' to its exciting end .
the director gojn mili was a photographer
and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shot of some of the musician
that makes this one of the most innovative angle of the '40s .
according to some note i read one of the musician was white
and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitude of the time .
what a shame .
still 
this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube
so
if you love jazz ,
i suggest you seek it out there .
