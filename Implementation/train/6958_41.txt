{ rant start } i did not want to believe them at first ,
but i guess this is what person are talking about when they say
south korean cinema has peaked
and may even be going downhill .
after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie `` gwoemul ''
( aka `` the host '' )
of 2006
-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b-movie genre --
successive korean blockbuster have become more and more generic ,
even though their budget
( mainly spent on special effect )
have become more and more fantastic .
do south korean movie-maker really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill ,
which their industry has built up since the 1999 eak-out film `` shiri/swiri '' ,
by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movie like mainland china did ?
{ rant end } the only `` reason '' i can fathom
for making this movie is to dupe the investor
into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean/ east asian-styled dragon i have seen to date 
for the final scene .
now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning
and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 `` dragonheart '' ,
the movie might have had a few more redeeming quality other
than having lot of digitally animated dragon .
remember `` dungeon and dragon '' in 2000 ?
has not anyone learnt
that the trick is not how much special effect you use ,
but how well you use it ?
i hope
there are more
( and better )
korean legends they can use ,
because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way
they filmed this one.in short 
i agree with all the negative review gone
before and wonder how korean felt about having their folk anthem `` arirang ''
being played at the very end .
as a creature feature 
i would have given it at least 5 star out of 10
if the special effect or action sequence had been worth it ,
but i have seen many video game with better camera work and scripting
( just less dragon ) .
