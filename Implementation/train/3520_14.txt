not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease
in which the two psycho are able to kidnap a pregnant woman
without eaking a sweat
but it was a terrible rip-off of 'misery ' .
however 
the main reason i gave this film such a low rating
was
because it absolutely disgusted me.i
am not someone easily shocked by what film-maker dish out
and have always had a love for horror flick
but this film went too far purely in term of violence and torture just for the sake of getting point in the shock factor.i
think most person ,
when watching just the first ten minute of 'hide and seek ' ,
will find themselves reaching for the remote .
