unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife 's transformation
( the fiend !
ruining it for us ) .
anycase ,
if this movie was not made-for-tv ,
it should have been ,
it is so remarkably low-budget 
underscripted 
underacted ,
and hit every 70 's cliche except disco .
nobody is likeable ,
and you could careless what happens to anyone in this one .
eminently forgetable except for the bad 
bad performance .
