i notice
that most of the person
who think
this film speaks
the truth were either not born before the moon landing
( 1969-1972 ) ,
or not old enough
to appreciate them .
i think
it is much easier to question an historic event
if
you did not live through it.i
was a youngster at the time of apollo ,
but i was old enough
to understand what was going on .
the entire world followed the moon landing .
our family gathered around the tv
to watch the launch .
newspaper headline screamed the latest goings-on each day 
from launch to landing 
from moonwalk to moon liftoff 
all the way to splashdown 
in a multitude of language .
in school 
some class were cancelled
so we could watch the main event on tv .
during apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective eath as the man limped home to an uncertain fate .
you could not go anywhere
without someone asking what the latest was .
the world was truly one community .
now with a buffer of 30-odd year after the fact ,
it is easy to claim fraud
because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down .
we are left with our history book ,
and anybody can claim
that history is wrong and attempt to `` prove '' it with a bunch of ly and made-up fact
while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence
showing otherwise
-- not to mantion the proof
that dwells in the soul and memory of those
who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic day .
