steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy 
first on 'the daily show ' ,
and then in various supporting role .
in virgin 
carell has found a clever and hilarious script
that perfectly capitalizes on his strength .
carell plays andy stitzer 
a middle aged man
living a quiet 
lonely life .
andy is a little odd ,
but in an awkward nice guy sort of way .
one night ,
while socializing with his co-worker for the first time ,
andy accidentally reveals
that he is a virgin .
his co-worker 
david
( paul rudd ) ,
jay
( romany malco ) ,
and cal
( seth rogen )
initially tease andy about his situation .
but it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human
being that andy is ,
and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity .
and so begins andy 's quest into adulthood .
andy is the quintessential innocent ,
and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivet\u00e9 to the situation
he finds
himself in throughout the film .
some of the humor is crude gross out stuff ,
but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy .
in addition 
i found some part of the film actually pretty touching
as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationship and friendship perhaps for the first time in his life .
i am not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama ;
it is a rolling in your seat comedy .
still 
every good comedy i have ever
seen contain enough heart for you to care about the character .
a good comparison would be 'the wedding crasher ' from earlier this summer .
virgin has a similar humor ,
but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its joke .
i particularly loved the ending of the film ,
which
i thought was a perfect way
to end the flick .
without giving anything away ,
it reminded me of 'something about mary ' .
very light and fun ; it leaves you laughing and smiling ,
which is exactly how you should feel
when you finish a comedy .
i would highly recommend .
