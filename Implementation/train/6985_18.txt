yike 
it was definitely one of those sleepless night
where i surfed the channel and bumped into this stinker of a movie .
for some of the name in the cast ,
i would expect a much better movie .
i am almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f. murray aaham being reduced to such a horrible part .
i hope
the money was worth it .
and the student 
they talked about fencing
like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster .
i mean ,
i have fenced ,
it is a fun sport ,
but i have never been that intense .
the only reason i
even watched this entire movie
was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back .
