marlon brando and frank sinatra hated each other
while doing this film and in the year
following it.brando asked sinatra for some singing lesson 
but sinatra
( who was already upset over the fact
that he was cast as nathan detroit ,
when he wanted the part of skye masterson )
wanted to be the star singer in the production
and did not want any one to be better
than he was.he told brando to get lost ,
so to get back at him marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep eating 
eating and eating.in the later year ,
sinatra gave brando the nickname `` mumble '' or `` mr.mumble ''
because of the way
he talks .
