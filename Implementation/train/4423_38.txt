anyone notice
that tommy only has 3 facial expressions.1 .
the angry eye look he gives every enemy .
2. the holding of the hand to face 
mouth agape and frightened eye .
3. the smiling tommy turnbull.i have to say
that i pretty much hate this show ,
i do not watch it
but it is like code lyoko ,
we have all watched at least one ,
i must say that this show is borderline racist 
uninteresting and pointless.every episode ends with robotboy winning 
except for one exception
when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack.the joke
are pretty crude too ,
i think
it is mostly person saying the word `` suck '' or farting 
i think
the bully of the show are quite shocking too.is not there one
that hides a bowling ball under his hate ,
and the other uses a chain 
for god sake 
what kind of school is he going to .
not to mention his older other ,
who is borderline psychopathic
and has no other character qualities.the whole show i feel
is ripping off megas xlr and foster .
like you could say
the trio of coop 
jamie and kiva 
as well as robotboy being similar to megas
where he beats everyone no matter what the odd
and he is free spirited
despite
being a robot.there
is simply no appeal to this show ,
i am surprised
that it is still running .
