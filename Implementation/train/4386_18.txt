i watched mask in the 80 's
and it is currently showing on fox kid in the uk
( very late at night ) .
i remember thinking
that it was kinda cool back in the day
and had a couple of the toy too
but watching it now bores me to tear .
i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was .
it is just plain awful !
it is no where near in the same league as the transformer 
he-man or thundercat and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone
once it stopped being made .
i only watch it on fox kid
because ulyss 31 comes on straight after it
( that is if mask does not put me to sleep first ) .
one of the lesser 80 's cartoon
that i hope to completely forget about again
once it finishes airing on fox kid !
