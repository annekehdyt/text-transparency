if it was not for some immature gullible idiot i know
insisting
that i watch this `` documentary '' i would never have seen this comedy !
this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moment .
one in particular is where the afghan police / soldier arrest don larson for filming in the street
while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away ,
still filming 
presumably to his plush hotel .
then there is the scene
where a car crash into another car
which has been turned upside down
and parked nicely on the side of the road
without any evidence
of it being in a crash or explosion.i am
surprised
this has currently got the rating
it has
( 5.8 / 10 ) .
i thought
imdb user had more sense .
