at the beginning of the movie 
the beautiful photography and the scene of the fox were amazing .
however 
the story was so very slow and boring .
and then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox ,
which leads to tragic event .
we live in the forest ,
and frequently see fox .
one thing
anyone should know
is that you leave wild animal
to be wild ,
and enjoy them from afar .
this movie sets a terrible example to the child
who will be watching it ,
in trying to make a wild creature into a pet .
i do not know
what the point of the story was supposed to be .
even after the terrible event with the main fox ,
the little girl was still wanting to play with the kit .
does she never learn her lesson ?
and there are other scene featuring predator animal to the fox ,
which only adds to the trauma inflicted on child watching this movie .
what a disappointment this movie was .
and what a horrible story it tells .
the final narrated dialog was so stupid ,
by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv !
i absolutely hated this movie ,
and would never recommend it to anyone !
