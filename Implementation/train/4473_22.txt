this is one of my favorite film of all time .
i read the book and liked it ,
but this movie expands on everything the book made famous .
the acting is fantastic 
especially from jon voight ,
who plays mr. sir ,
a very evil character .
this film has a certain way of storytelling
that keeps you hooked throughout ,
until the end
where everything is pulled together for a great ending .
i also love the way
this is directed ,
by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanley 's ancestor ' story .
the story was written by louis sachar 
yes ,
but it seems
that this story is made for film ,
and andrew davis does a great job
directing it .
i definitely recommend this to anyone
who enjoys good movie .
