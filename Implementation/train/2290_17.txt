there is no doubt
that this film has an impressive cast
but unfortunately this does not help with the major downside to the movie .
i never understand
why director ask actors/actress to use accent not their own
when it is obvious to everyone
they can not convince .
fienne just can not do irish and fitzgerald is not much better at russian .
when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing .
as the for the major problem ... .the plot ... .was there one ?
i guess
there was some sort of storyline involved
but it was so full of hole
that i just could not wait for the film to end ...
it was ridiculous .
save 90 minute of your life
and do not watch this movie !
