i voted 8 for this movie
because of some minor childish flaw .
other than that 
this movie is one of my favorite !
it is entertaining to say the least .
the shooting scene are ridiculous though ,
and i think gackt
( who wrote the book )
takes a little bit too much of his `` matrix obsession '' into it .
it seems like their enemy just stands there ... waiting
to get shot at .
however 
this movie is touching
and it always makes me cry .
it has a lot of great humor
in it so it makes me laugh as well .
gackt is a superb actor i must say..he show so much emotion .
this was hyde 's first time acting
and he did okay .
the role fits him .
wang lee hom is absolutely great .
the whole cast is what i would say 
perfect for this movie .
do not miss it !
you will regret it !
