if deborah messing were not already cast as `` grace '' ,
this might be a tolerable film .
however 
it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issue ,
who hires a paid escort
( dermot mulroney )
she reads about in a time magazine article
to travel
to london for her sister 's london wedding .
how new is this plot ?
neither funny 
nor remotely romantic 
the wedding date slide over the storyline of deceptive sex by ide and best man ,
and paid for escort to pass off the film as four wedding
without hugh ,
and definitely 
a dead end deal for the naive groom
who is ignorant to the sexual history of his ide
( amy adams ) .
while messing has perfected the repressed princess ,
30- something woman with a failed relationship history ,
her neurotic and drunken move on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her tv series .
if this woman is an actress ,
get a role
that does not rehash what is already on prime time.lot of drunken female bonding 
cricket visual joke 
and mulroney in a towel
( nice !
) ,
but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending .
expected messing sequel :
divorce date .
