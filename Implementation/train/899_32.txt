sundown - featuring the weakest 
dorkiest vampire ever seen ,
accompanied by one of the most unfitting 
pretentious score
ever written - and with shane the vampire ,
who 's every move
and spoken word was so ridiculous
that i burst out laughing half the time
and rolled my eye the rest.the vampire do not seem to have any special power at all - except for strength
( sometime ) 
being able to switch off a lamp with their mind
( one time )
and ... that is it 
really .
ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause
he ran out of bullet ?
neither did i. practically
any other movie-dracula would eat this one for eakfast ,
skin his follower and use their bone
as toothpicks.the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - dracula 's vs. some old geezer 's .
it could have been some good old b-flick fun ,
but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone
who took this movie a bit too seriously ,
and ends up
ruining the remaining part of the movie
not already ruined by clay bat 
mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.in the end
it is just too silly to be funny .
sure 
it has some amusing moment ,
but they are few 
and far apart .
