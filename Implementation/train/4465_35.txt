best-selling horror novelist cheryl
( a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely virginia bryant ) ,
her husband tom
( the likable paolo serra ) ,
and their son bobby
( nicely played by patrizio vinci )
go to a remote castle
located in the countryside for summer vacation .
local legend claim
that the area is cursed .
cheryl discovers a creepy 
hairy 
nasty ogre
( hulking david flosi in a strikingly hideous costume )
living in the basement .
cheryl has to surmount her deep-seated childhood fear of the beast
so she can defeat the foul find .
director/co-writer lamberto bava does an expert job
of creating and sustaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood .
moreover 
bava eschews the standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in favor of crafting a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale-like fable on how the best way
to overcome
that
which frightens us is to face
said source head on .
sturdy supporting turn by saina ferilli as friendly school teacher anna 
stefania montorsi as hottie babysitter maria 
and alex serra as batty painter dario .
gianfranco transunto 's glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shot and plenty of great atmospheric lighting .
faizio sforza 's gnarly make-up f/x 
simon boswell 's splendidly spirited spooky'n'shuddery score 
and the dank 
dark 
cobweb-covered cellar set all hit the skin-crawling spot .
well worth watching .
