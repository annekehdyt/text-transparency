this movie is bad news
and i am really surprised at the level of big name talent
who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this .
i imagine
there were a few strangled agent sprawled across hollywood blvd .
as a result of this fiasco .
what really gets you is that it could have been good .
the director star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sale ,
but this is a flop .
the multiple story line all go from bad to silly by the picture end ,
and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze
looking for a piece of cheese
that turns out to be rotten .
what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italian
who may have beat him up
when he was a kid or insulted him ,
as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotype .
as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork .
he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche
and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scene .
but the question remains ... can you endure the other 2 hour of head scratching and clock
watching as you wonder and wait for the ending
that has to be there somewhere .
