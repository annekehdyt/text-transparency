just cause is one of those film
that at first makes you wonder
quite why it was so heavily slated
when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris .
then you hit the last third and everything start to get increasingly silly
until you have got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery 's wife
( a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw )
and kid
( a very young scarlet johannsen )
in an alligator skinner 's shack .
the kind of movie
that is probably best
seen on a plane ,
and even then only once .
