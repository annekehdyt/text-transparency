not your typical vamp story ,
not am stoker or anne rice here .
a truly original vampyre story .
these vampyre are genetic mutant
who the sunlight do not bother .
they are pure evil to .
the film is not perfect .
many of the actor are clearly amateur .
the two lead
who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick
are pretty good though .
the film is intensely violent
which may disturb some person .
also it is loaded with scientific detail
that many will find hard to understand
and may get bored with .
i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performance .
no telling how successful this film could be
if they had a bigger budget
and it got mass distribution
