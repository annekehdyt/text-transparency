the early to mid 90s were a high point 
in my opinion 
for the historical drama .
last of the mohican 
braveheart 
rob roy -
all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods.rob roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time
and place rarely represented by film .
it really has everything - interesting story 
great acting 
remarkable dialog 
and eathtaking scenery .
i was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog .
i can imagine this is how early 18th century person spoke and behaved.something else
that surprised me was the vulgarity
expressed by the character .
i found it to be more repulsive and shocking ,
albeit often more subtle ,
than most found in film set in modern time .
the movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge
to it
that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era.the pace was very tight 
with hardly a dull moment .
there was much intrigue and political subplot
that complicated thing a bit ,
but yet did not detract from the main storyline.the action was also very well done and gripping .
something
that i will forever find remarkable
is that during the highlight action piece in the film 
there is no soundtrack whatsoever .
it makes for a very tense 
exciting sequence ,
since we have no musical cue
as to the direction and resolution of the scene.rob roy will always remain high on my list of favorite film .
i would recommend it to all .
