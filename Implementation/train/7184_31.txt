upon the first viewing ,
i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tale .
after many more ,
i think
it is one of the best .
some of the song are pretty bad 
especially the love song ,
but two thing stand out
that make the movie 
even the singing 
worthwhile .
one is the art direction .
like the other cannon movie tale 
this is a beautifully decorated period piece ;
every piece of cloth and jewel
( both of which have major part in this movie 's plot )
look fresh and new ,
and contrast with the plain clothe of the peasant .
even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess 
wonderfully done .
the other thing is the comic timing .
a lot of the movie is cheesy 
but the emperor 's vanity
( and his making fun of himself in the end ) ,
the suspicious guard 
the guard chasing nichola 
and the stupid prince 
were all quite funny
and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose .
and the sequence during the song weave-o makes up for the song
that were not so good .
