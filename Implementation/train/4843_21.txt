rural family drama
-- with perhaps a nod to `` ordinary person '' --
concerns a young boy
who withdraws into himself
after fatally wounding his older other in a shooting mishap .
despite downbeat subject matter
( given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain ) ,
there are some dynamic in this sad story worth exploring .
unfortunately 
the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult character
to take charge of the situation render
the film a stultifying experience .
what with robert duvall 
glenn close 
and wilford brimley in the cast 
the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of `` the natural '' .
too bad this project did not get the necessary talent
behind the camera
to really eke out a gripping 
memorable picture .
