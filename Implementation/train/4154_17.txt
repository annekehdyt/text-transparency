in the early 1970s 
many of us
who had emaced hippy/acid/alternative culture wholeheartedly ,
had realised
that mainstream society was not going to change in the way
we thought
it would .
for me this film defined the tension of `` now what ? ''
that many of the person i knew felt at that time .
do we head for the commune
and create our own vision of utopia
or do we radicalize
and push for change ? from the futile gesture to police 
the radical rhetoric 
the music of pink floyd 
to the love-making and the explosive image in the desert - so much is in there .
it captures well a significan not moment in time .
