well 
i just discovered
that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than `` little britain '' and i like it !
`` the league of gentleman '' is a sick british comedy
that is about the most awful 
insane and disgusting small town in all the uk .
this place makes dibley and craggy island
( from `` the vicar of dibley '' and `` father ted '' )
seem pretty normal ! !
the format of the show is a lot like little britain
except that all of it centers around the townsperson of this one hellish town .
both show feature the same skit again and again every episode and some obviously inspired `` little britain ''
( particularly the job seeking class skit ) .
but the show differ
because although it is crude like `` little britain ''
( hence not a show for kid ) ,
the show has a sick and sadistic quality
that sets it apart from all these show .
in particular 
animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring theme throughout the show.now
if you have not guessed ,
this is not a show for kid 
the easily offended or normal person
and that is probably why i liked it .
however 
you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful
to enjoy this to the max .
funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief
-- you have to see it to believe it .
