okay ,
if you have seen the ring ,
you have basically seen the grudge .
it is trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sound ,
but it fails miserably .
the plot ,
if you can call it that ,
is weak
and rather full of hole 
for instance ,
how would the care center have known
that yoko did not show up for work
when the person
who lived in the house
were not there ?
and it is not really clear what bill pullman 's character had to do with anything .
he just kind of came out of nowhere
to advance the plot .
it did not make a lot of sense what happened to the original family .
who was hanging in the room 
the little boy or the dad ?
and was yoko alive or dead
when the care center guy found her ?
there were too many unanswered question
and i was too bored to think about it more .
