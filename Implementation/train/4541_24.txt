a failure .
the movie was just not good .
it has humor that 5 year old that will not even giggle at .
i mean 
sure 
some part were amusing ,
but most of it is not .
lindsey lohan is a great actress
( and a bad singer 
)
and she should be working on better movie .
the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie ,
that is free.the only thing
that was well done about this movie was the music .
nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to ighten up your day .
these song are so good .
especially alyson and amanda 's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter 's 
beach boy song 
fun fun fun.4/10 .
if i gave it a ten ,
9 of that would be the music
and 1 will be the movie .
not worth your money ,
but the soundtrack is .
