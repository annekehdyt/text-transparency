this is not bela lagosi 's best movie ,
but it is got a good old style approach
for some 40 's horror entertainment.bride are dropping dead at the altar like fly .
i think
i would postpone the wedding
until after the fiend is caught ,
but it is a horror movie ,
so i guess
person ignore the danger for some reason .
anyway 
lagosi is a mad doctor ,
who needs young female blood
to keep his aging 
sickly wife healthy and happy .
he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the body in a hearse
( who would think
of looking for a corpse in a hearse ?
) ,
and the ide just keep
on getting zapped.no movie
like this would be complete
without a lois lane type female reporter
who wants to catch the criminal on her own .
good at solving crime 
bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong time ,
guess
who lagosi pick for his next intended victim .
i love the `` haunted house '' bit
where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosi 's sinister mansion .
hidden passageway 
a vampire-like wife 
an evil dwarf igor assistant 
and so on .
good stuff.fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving ,
and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner .
if you like old horror movie ,
this one is worth a watch .
