i have to admit
that i went into fever pitch with low expectation .
it is no huge revelation for me to say
that jimmy fallon 's last movie
( taxi )
was catwomanly bad ,
and the trailer for fever pitch were all right
but did not mesmerize me .
i was already preparing some cheesy baseball pun for my review ... '' i like jimmy fallon ,
but taxi was strike one in his movie career .
well 
now we have got steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo !
one more strike ,
and it is back to snl ! ''
or `` buy yourself some peanut and cracker jack ,
but do not buy ticket to fever pitch .
you will walk out of the theater
and never go back ! ''
then the movie had to go
and be way more entertaining than i was expecting .
but hey 
i could not let my pun go to waste 
right ?
another reason i thought
i would not care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox .
my whole family hates 'em .
the mere mention of pedro martinez ' name sends me running to the bathroom .
oh man 
hold on ... ... all right ,
i am back .
anyway 
my mom ,
who is a st. louis cardinal fan ,
still believes
the world series was rigged last year .
she refuses to believe
the sox won it legitimately .
but i am man enough
to admit
that fever pitch caused me to sympathize ,
albeit only slightly 
with the plight of red sox fan.anybody
who has a passion for sport
will be able to relate to this movie on some level .
unless you have a favorite sport team
you can not fully understand the extreme high and lows
that a fan such as fallon 's ben can go through .
there is nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season
and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate .
well 
figuratively speaking .
it is the joy of being a sport fan .
`` wait 'til next year 
''
becomes your mantra 
your motto 
your prayer - and fever pitch effectively captures
that essence.i love the fact
that the movie takes a fictional story
and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the red sox ' improbable world series run last year .
i do not love it so much
that i want to marry it ,
but you know what i mean .
i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner ,
and
while some of the humor is a little silly ,
it is actually pretty realistic.you see ,
ben 's uncle took him to his first red sox game
when he was 7 year old ,
and
when he died
he left ben his two season ticket .
ben has not missed a game in 23 year .
at the beginning of each season he has a draft day
where he and his friend get together to figure out
who gets to go to which game with him .
he makes everybody dance for the yankee game
and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with ticket for the game with the royal
( sorry mr. shade )
and the devil rays .
it is a very good scene ,
and it works so well
because i actually know of person
who do the `` ticket draft day . ''
i also must admit
that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parent .
the red sox are playing a road game ,
but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it .
one of the most dangerous thing in life is taping a game
and then being in public
and trying to avoid hearing the result .
been there .
it is a very tense and scary situation .
weeeeeell 
ben enter the danger zone
when a guy shows up at the restaurant
and mention watching the game .
ben immediately covers his ears
and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome .
lindsey is embarrassed ,
and her parent do not know what to think .
yeah 
sport fan can be weird ,
i do not deny it .
but it is real.now
if you are expecting the crude 
edgy stuff
that the farrelly other are known for then you could be disappointed .
they do have their moment though ,
like when ben says
he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth `` like an adorable stroke victim 
''
but overall this is definitely a softer 
more romantic side
that the os are putting on display.that
is not to say
that the movie ever gets way too sappy .
thankfully ,
when the sap starts to ooze a bit ,
the farrellys know
when to pull away .
a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field
and running over to ben
to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying ,
`` you have got ta tell me about the outfield .
is it spongy ? ''
jimmy fallon proves
that with the right material
he can handle himself well on the big screen ,
and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm .
fever pitch is just good 
solid entertainment
that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre .
it is a movie
that guy and gal can both relate to .
particularly the guy
who practice sport fanaticism at some point during the year and the lady
who must deal with 'em.now
if the red sox fan could please shut up about the `` curse of the bambino '' i
would appreciate it .
my memphis tiger have never won the ncaa basketball championship ,
so i officially declare my plight greater than yours.the gist fan of jimmy fallon ,
drew barrymore 
romantic comedy 
the red sox 
baseball 
or sport fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look .
i would not go out of my way to rush
and see it at the first available time ,
but it will make a great matin\u00e9e.rating :
3.25
( out of 5 )
