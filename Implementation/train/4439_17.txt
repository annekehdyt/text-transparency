two sniper travel deep in the jungle in search for their target ;
a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general.moderately successful at building a ooding atmosphere 
sniper is by most account a very solid thriller ,
taking it is time ,
establishing it is character and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequence .
director llosa is not always successful
at maintaining the some mood
and could have tightened the story somewhat ;
some detour here do not add up to much .
but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist.billy zane 
usually incredibly tiresome ,
does surprisingly well
as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger .
as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture .
he can do these kind of role in his sleep
and he is very convincing here ,
reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequel .
