this is the worst documentary
to come out of canada ever ! ! ! !
i am glad to see the guy have not made another movie .
all they want to do is get a movie made
and it does not have to be the one they wrote .
they keep changing the script to suite the person
they are pitching .
i could not get out of the theatre fast enough
when i saw it at that year 's toronto film festival .
please never see this film .
