i saw the movie
and really could not stop my tear .
its tragedy
that india has no such leader after freedom ,
who dare to do justice with their own child ,
when they do not behave properly.. in current generation 
politician ing their child 's into politic
without measuring their caliber and skills.. i remember the dialogue from gandhi 'what kind of society
we want to create/make with such person
( about harilal ) ? '
no wonder that it will be a dream
that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. einstein was right
when he said about gandhi
that 'after 50 year one would hardly believe
that such person with body 
soul and mind
( mahatma gandhi )
had ever lived on this earth . '
i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor 
feroze khan and all film actors/actress for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son .
all father and son should watch this movie once
and take some lesson for both role .
