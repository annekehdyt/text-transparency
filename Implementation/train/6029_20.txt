i saw this film back at the 2005 palm spring international film festival and of the 14 film i saw
there i would rank this as my # 3 film .
i had an initial interest
in seeing this being of swedish descent
myself with many of my ancestor coming from the norrland region of sweden
where this was filmed .
also i grew up in an area of rural north wood america
where many small town were much like the setting of this film .
it is nice to see more film
using rural location
as their setting like s\u00e5 som i himmelen .
this was a very good film
and i am sure a very hard film
to pull together with it is large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing .
helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut
as an actress was fantastic
and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen .
i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast .
i would highly recommend this film
and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10 .
