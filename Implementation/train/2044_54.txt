lee hosted the 100 year of horror for ted newsom
and was talking about filmic werewolf .
he said something to the effect
that his only ush with lycan nothropy was the howling ii ,
then he quipped ,
`` the less said
about that the better . ''
indeed he was right
as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performance .
the first howling by joe dante was a groundeaking werewolf film with its incredible special effect and its campy sense of style and subject matter .
it was a film
to be taken seriously .
like other good original film 
filmmaker for some strange reason thought
that even more campy sequel were needed rather than what worked the first time
( see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point ) .
this film is mile and mile away from the first on every front .
there is absolutely nothing scary about it .
it look cheap
and is pitch black through most of the major scene .
lee is the only actor in the film worth
mentioning
( okay 
i will cede ferdy mayne too ) .
lee look embarrassed
as he says
inane dialog and does ridiculous thing
( check out
that ending with him and stirba ) .
lee look incredibly tired
and knows
what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two lead
who leave america
to go to romania .
the story is not really worth examining here ,
and you can bet
there is very little story worth
mentioning
when you have to have stephen parson
and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise .
sybil danning is here and 
yes ,
she disrobes once
and then we get
that scene showed again and again
and again - one reviewer said
17 time
( i counted ten -
but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point ) .
i gave the film three star ,
but it really deserves a zero -
the three i gave
it are 1 for lee and two for ms. danning 's contribution .
yuck !
