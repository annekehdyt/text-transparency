most italian horror lover seem to hate this movie
since because it has no connection to the first two demon film .
and with the `` demon iii '' in the title 
one would assume
it would .
the problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the demon series .
the distributor only a `` demon iii '' above its original title `` the ogre '' to cash in on the other film popularity .
the new american dvd release of this picture has the title `` demon iii :
the ogre '' on the box art
but the film itself only says `` the ogre '' .
i do not know
if past release had the title `` demon iii '' on the actual film itself ,
but this new release just seems to be a little white lie .
if you can get past the `` demon iii '' in the title ,
you might some enjoyment in `` the ogre '' .
it starts out with a creep intro ,
and stays pretty creep throughout .
there is no gore and the film movie slowly ,
but i still dug it .
just do not expect it to be like the other demon film .
i give `` the ogre '' 7/10 .
italian fan should try it out .
