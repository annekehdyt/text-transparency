i wish i could give this movie a zero 
or even lower ,
because sadly
that is what it deserves .
i honestly never walk out of a movie ,
but this one was so dreadfully awful
that i could not stand another minute of it .
please 
please 
please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie .
if you want a hot lesbian movie
that you can really delve into ,
this is not it.it has unattractive 
unappealing lead 
choppy structure 
ridiculous dialog ,
and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way .
on an absolutely basic level ,
it fails to entertain .
everything about `` mango kiss '' is so stagey ,
it is worse than any student film i have seen.as
if that were not enough ,
the entire movie rely on constant
( and i mean constant )
voice over narration .
the script writer may as well have written a novel ,
because they insisted on telling everything ,
instead of showing it .
we are just supposed to assume
that lou and sassafra are the best of friend
and have a special connection ,
even though there is no character development
to illustrate this .
also 
this film continues to introduce to new character after the first five minute ,
and not in a natural way ,
but in a freeze-frame of the character with their name written over the screen .
there is no introduction 
no development of any of the character .
we do not really get to know
any of them.this is the most amateur movie i have ever seen.i am a gay woman ,
who watched this film with my roommate
( another gay woman )
and we both found this movie
to be a depressing representation of queer cinema .
i am beginning to think
that lesbian and gay movie are a lot like christian rock -
it does not matter how atrocious it is ,
person will still flock to it ,
and champion it 
no matter how poor the quality is .
please do not rent this ! !
instead 
let 's encourage the production of quality gay and lesbian movie by renting
`` but i am a cheerleader '' or `` fire '' or `` heavenly creature '' ,
instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe
they aim at the gay community
( i.e .
queer as folk ) .
