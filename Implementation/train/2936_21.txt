this horrendously bad piece of trash manage to be racist 
sexist and homophobic all at once ,
while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated .
atrocious performance 
a cliche ridden screenplay 
and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of .
two scene were especially offensive - the one
in which schaech scrubs his tongue
after being kissed by another man
( could it really have been that gross ) ,
and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech 's best friend ,
who is pretending to be russian .
after he leaves the room
she exclaims `` f**king foreigner '' !
so much for her being a cultured artist
who dreams of living in paris ! ?
! jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen ,
and is astonishingly good-looking .
it is a shame
he did not learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film ,
and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotype and a mire of homophobia .
