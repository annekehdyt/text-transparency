do you still love woody allen 's humor and sense of the absurd ?
do you wait patiently for movie
that get the plot going in the first five minute
instead
of making you wait around ?
if so 
you will adore this comedic murder mystery .
it has all the element of a good mystery :
sharp plot 
a handsome suspect 
romance 
and intrigue 
mixed together with enough laugh and wink at fate
to keep even the most jaded of movie goer happy.with beautiful person and gorgeous home
and landscape to ogle ,
this frothy movie is just the thing
to take your mind off your trouble .
as woody might say ,
what is not to like ?
