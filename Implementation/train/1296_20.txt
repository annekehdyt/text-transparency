if you want to know the real story of the wendigo ,
i suggest
you pick up a copy of algernon blackwell 's original story .
this movie was not only bad
but had nothing to do with the book.i loved the book
when i read it as a kid
( in `` campfire chiller '' by e.m. freeman )
and was so excited to see a movie
based
on it come out .
i was so disappointed
when i finally saw it .
another thing is that there were too many pc
( politically correct )
undertone throughout the movie
that had no place in the film .
when the book was written pc
did not even exist.my suggestion is do not waste your time or money ! !
if you see it on the video store shelf leave
it there .
