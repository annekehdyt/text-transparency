this is a terrible production of bartleby 
though not ,
as the other reviewer put it
because it is `` unfilmable 
''
but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book .
it tells the story 
almost painfully so .
watching it ,
i could turn the page in my book
and follow along ,
which is not as much fun
when dealing with an adaptation .
rather 
see the 2001 version of bartleby featuring crispin glover .
that version ,
while humorous 
ings new detail to the film
while maintaining the spirit of the novel .
what is important is the spirit ,
not the minutiae of thing
like setting 
character name 
and costume .
the difference between these film version is like night and day 
tedious and hilarious .
this version is a lesson
as to what can go wrong
if an adaptation is handled poorly 
painful 
mind-numbing schlock .
