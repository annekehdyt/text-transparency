tom had a wish
to make film for a long time
and he did .
it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little idea
he has been filling up
and carrying around for 10 year .
no grant character transformation 
no hollywood ingredient just life and a little bit of magic .
the balance 
in speed 
in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed .
this film takes you on a journey
that is over
before you realize
how nice it was .
the music is great
and your eye will be equally satisfied .
the fact
that this film is about nothing ,
merely a sequence of sketch of person
that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the character ,
makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining ,
it is illiant
because it is empty .
in between the line it is happening .
to see or not to see ,
that is the ?
