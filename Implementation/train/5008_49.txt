sure 
this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich\u00e9s ,
but it is entertaining ,
and that is what i watch movie for .
to be entertained .
natasha henstridge is stunning 
even with the short hair .
her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised .
as for michael vartan 
i am sure the woman love him .
the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film .
i do not understand the comment
that there was no chemistry between them .
i guess
we see what we want to see.olivia d'abo and michael rigoli
were fun to watch ,
even if d'abo 's british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech .
to tell you
the truth i had not really noticed it until i read these comment ,
but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me ,
but she was ideal for her role with that one exception .
it is a story of two nice person
who are getting married to significan not other ,
but who find their soul mate in one another .
it may be an unlikely story ,
but
who says
movie are all supposed to play like documentary ?
it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas
that are screened every hour on the tube .
that is why we watch them ,
to escape from the humdrum of daily
living for a short time
and enter the world of the character on the screen .
i thought
these actor did a good job of it 
but hey 
i am a sentimental guy
who tears up easily .
do not get me wrong though ,
it has to be a sentimental scene ,
and this movie had plenty of those.i give it 9/10
only because i am saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie
that i know will come along some day .
if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movie 
or whatever ,
make a note to watch it .
i think
you will like it .
