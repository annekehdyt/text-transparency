i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie
displayed in the `` horror '' section in an oxford street store
and also advertised as a `` classic thriller '' .
in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur askey 
one of the most popular name in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades.perhap his incessantly cheerful ,
exuberant and essentially good-natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much british comedy of the past twenty five year .
however there are still those
who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos .
askey was an idol of the great tommy cooper
who frequently borrowed the `` self-strangulation '' gag
that arthur attempt to entertain the stranded passenger with.there
is a striking 
rare appearance by the under-rated linden traver ,
who makes an impact as the mysterious julie .
