i have read all the comment on this film .
i am a great admirerof the dalai lama .
as such 
i read the book upon
which thisfilm was based .
the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth .
i do not criticize
it foraltering small detail or event for dramatic purpose ;
it isnot a documentary .
but the script change the impact 
reaction 
reality ,
and change in every main character .
it vastly altersthe real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama .
from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman
( which demeansthe culture of tibet )
to harra 's music box gift 
to harrar'schange of heart ,
everything about this movie is false - exceptfor the amazing photography .
i understand
that the shot of thepotala
( the palace )
were smuggled out of tibet .
however ,
changing a real story about the relationship between two person 
one of them very important to this world ,
in order to build up amovie star
is sad
