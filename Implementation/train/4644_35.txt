simply the best estonian film
that i have ever seen ,
although it is made by a finnish director ilkka j\u00e4rvi-laturi .
tallin pimeduse is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangster
who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold 
a national treasure
that belongs to the republic of estonia .
but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the condition of many eastern european country at that time .
in the early 90s soviet union fell into piece and many country 
such as estonia 
became independent .
now the condition may be better in most of those country .
but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nation had to fight against corruption and organized crime
that the soviet era had left them as inheritance .
( and many of them still do ... at least on some level ... )
tallinn pimeduse is a very realistic film of that era with believable character and with a well-written script .
the actor are also very good 
especially j\u00fcri j\u00e4rvet
( perhaps the best
known estonian actor ,
plays snaut in tarkovski 's solaris ) ,
playing and old gangster
who 's slowly becoming tired of his way of life .
but the most astonishing performance comes from monika m\u00e4ger 
a child-actor playing terje 
a boyish girl in her early teen ,
whose presence in the plot is quite essential .
( and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb-credit list ! ! !
) wthere are not many film in the world
that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time .
but tallinn pimeduse does that .
unfortenately j\u00e4rvi-laturi 's other film are far from this kind of achievement .
his first one 
kotia p\u00e4in was too artificial and his latest ,
history is made at night was just a weird mess .
