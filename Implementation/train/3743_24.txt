wow this is the worst movie ever .
the only reason i
signed up for imdb
was so i
could complain about this movie .
i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a dvd
but i almost stopped this one
( and i should have ) .
but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending .
wow
if this is all
that wes craven can produce his time
is long up .
i have never seen the first one
and will never
after watching this .
its terrible acting with a terrible plot .
hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us
lets go check it out .
and the sad part is that
when this movie came to dvd
it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever .
so i feel bad for all the person
that saw this junk .
