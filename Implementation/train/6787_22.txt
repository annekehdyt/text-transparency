i really liked this movie ,
and went back
to see it two time more within a week.ms .
detmer nailed the performance -
she was like a hungry cat on the prowl 
toying with her prey .
she lashes out in rage and lust ,
taking a `` too young '' lover ,
and crashing hundred of her terrorist fianc\u00e9 's mother 's piece of fine china to the floor .
the film was full of beautiful touch .
the maserati 
the wonderful wardrobe 
the flower box along the rooftop .
i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class
and the recitation of 'antigone'.it had a feeling of 'story of o ' -
that is ,
where person of mean indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure .
as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff ,
she is at ease -
and why not ,
what is to restrain a `` devil in the flesh '' ?
the whole movie is a real treat !
