bo is jane parker ,
whose long-lost anthropologist father
( richard harris 
in the worst role of a very inconsistent career )
is in africa
studying something or another .
she tracks him down
( how ? )
and he tells her of the native ' story of a giant monster
whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle .
turns out to be the ape man himself
( mile o'keeffe ,
who has the film 's best dialogue ) ,
who rescues her from bad guy and fall in love with her ,
leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hour to romp naked
while a horny monkey looks on and cheer .
normally i am very open-minded to varying opinion about any film ,
but this is the sole exception .
this is the worst film
ever made .
if you do not agree ,
you have not seen it .
( note :
newsday called it `` unendurable 
''
which is the best one-word summary i
can think of .
the maltin movie guide comment
that they almost had to think of a rating lower than bomb . )
