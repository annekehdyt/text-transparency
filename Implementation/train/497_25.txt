this movie is a should-be classic .
it is not perfect 
certainly .
the pacing ,
while perfect for the stage ,
is in movie form slow as a tortoise with arthritic knee .
jean seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle .
she fully shows enough acting talent 
skill ,
and craft to convincingly play the clever 
passionate ,
and confident joan 
but 
unfortunately 
the director missed the point of the character .
george bernard shaw is my favorite playwright .
in no other play has his dialog been more sharp 
nor the line more musical .
however 
processing this film requires
that you look at it as a lawyer .
this movie is a case ,
and the viewer is the judge .
that is how this picture is to be enjoyed .
7/10 .
