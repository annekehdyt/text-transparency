russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928
( william powell )
is casting his epic about the russian revolution 
and hires an old ex-general from the czarist regime
( emil janning )
to play the general of the film ,
and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman
they shared
( evelyn brent ) ,
of 11 year before.try as i might ,
i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command ' for all its virtue .
'the dock of new york ' was indubitably a great film ,
and 'underworld ' is a film i have always been craving to see ,
but 'the last command ' is rather heavy-going .
the premise is fascinating ,
but the treatment does really make the script come to life ,
except in the sequence set in hollywood ,
depicting the eadline of employable extra and the machination of a big movie production with state-of-the-art technology.emil janning
is 
predictably 
a marvelous russian general 
distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general 
transfixed in his misery 
and the vigorous 
hearty officer of yore.the ending is great
and worth the wait ,
but in order to get there
you must prepared to be slightly bored at time .
