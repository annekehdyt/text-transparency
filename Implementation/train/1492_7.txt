the movie is a bit `` thin ''
after reading the book ,
but it is still one of the greatest movie ever made .
sheryl lee is beautiful
and nick nolte is really `` vonneguty '' .
he makes great job expressing the feeling from the book to the film .
not many film engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does .
