this movie makes no sense at all ,
there are plot hole big enough
to drive enormous nypd vehicle through .
the character do not act in any plausible way whatsoever .
i will put my comment in the chat board ,
but save your time and money ,
this is stupid .
i can not stand
when hollywood spends million of dollar on flash bang equipment
and uses fancy editing and cool music ,
and does not bother to have a plot
that hangs together at even the most basic level .
but it is nice to see denzel w. prevail over the man ,
who comes in 3 flavor 
jodi foster 
mayor bloomberg and capt .
von trapp .
there is even a sweet little kid with a video game
who is nice .
