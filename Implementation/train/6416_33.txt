i am trying to decide
if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck .
it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of film .
with jedi 
menace 
clown and sith we have the death of lucas ' career .
he wants us to swallow the annakin is vader nonsense ?
i never believed
it was true .
this film vindicates those feeling .
the story has not worked since phantom moron ,
and each new film just piled the crap on until all
that was left was a toy parade .
i have to go .
i know
where some new rock to throw are .
you want spoiler ?
here they come .
luke and leia are not related .
vader is not their father .
duke countoo should have switched side
while he still could .
yoda has less verbal skill than yogi berra .
his advice has never been any good to anybody .
obi wan lied to luke for the first two film .
annakin did not build c3p0 .
he found him in the desert and lied to his mom about putting him together from scratch .
chewbacca has fleas .
this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h amma-lamma-ding-dong .
if she had any ain
she would not have come within a light year of annie ,
but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her .
what a dope !
