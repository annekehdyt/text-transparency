watching smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minute of my life .
there was not a laugh to be had ;
in fact 
i do not remember ever cracking a smile .
diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder 
the textbook overbearing mother character 
a relentlessly irritating woman
who clearly suffer from some kind of personality disorder .
she is manipulative 
conniving 
melodramatic 
childish 
narcissistic 
and worst of all 
boring.i suppose i should iefly mention the other character ,
but why bother ?
it was just a long string of movie clich\u00e9s
-- the dippy 
socially inept distant relative
who 's just trying to eak into `` the industry '' 
the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father 
the mild- mannered wife
who just can not take it anymore
( but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home ) ,
the herd of unhouseoken dog
who like to chew throw pillow
while everyone
is away 
etc.god 
what a snore .
i have never been a diane keaton fan and smother only reminded me why .
overacting is overacting ,
no matter how many picture you did in your prime .
her attempt at physical comedy were especially humiliating .
what was the director thinking ?
while i like dax shepard and can even sometime tolerate liv tyler ,
their performance were so lackluster and dull
that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie .
that was okay ,
because neither did i. keaton 's endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at time shepard 's dislike for her seemed genuine .
by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself.awful .
