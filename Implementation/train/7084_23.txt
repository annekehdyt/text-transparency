this film is a true and historical film .
it is very useful to those researching the ld church ,
because it is 100 % true .
it is an excellent film
and i recommend it.it is very factual 
exciting 
and motivational .
there are some
who think
it is not factual ,
but it is.it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saint 
and about the prophet 
joseph smith ,
who restored it .
it has such event in his life as the disease
that he had
when he was a small boy 
his courting emma smith 
emma 
his wife 
giving birth 
and so on .
but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church .
