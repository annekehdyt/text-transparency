what an incomprehensible mess of a movie .
something about a cop
who extracts bullet from himself
after he gets shot
and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom
( and from the size of the jar he is been shot about fifty time by now )
and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldier
who for some reason drive it into mexico .
whether they were sent there
intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear .
and you will never hear another screenplay feature the word `` butthorn '' either .
gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from `` lethal weapon ''
and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity .
william smith does another turn as a russian soldier 
the same character
he played in `` red dawn '' a few year earlier .
after playing biker heavy for most of the 70s
it was sort of nice
to see him expand his range
playing communist heavy .
sadly he will probably always be remembered best as the guy
who clint eastwood whupped in `` every
which way
you can . ''
