it is funny .
i have seen a bunch of fassbinder film
and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting ,
while other are repellent and self-indulgent mess
-- like this film .
for me 
it ranges from great to crap
-- without much in the middle .
i know
he has a lot of fan among the `` sophisticated '' ,
but i can not help but think
that a lot of his appeal is pure hype .
from my point of view
( and i know
i will get a lot of negative rating for this ) ,
he made too many movie too quickly
and was too self-indulgent .
his gay or gender-bending film
( like this one )
tend to be really bad
-- sloppily done 
sometimes quite boring
( such as querelle and the bitter tear of petra von kant )
and sometimes just gross
( like this film ) .
could not his message about acceptance of a person 's gender-confusion be handled better
than showing him get slapped around or watching cow
being gruesomely slaughtered ?
show some sensitivity for the subject matter
and make your character more human and sympathetic
-- then 
maybe 
i would care about the film .
i am honestly at the point
after watching this film
that i might not bother with any more fassbinder film
-- the bad seems to be out-weighing the good .
