i liked this movie a lot.i rented this expecting something not too bad
to spend an evening.it
turned out a particularly satisfying experience .
some scene were hilarious
and managed to be so in a movie
not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy
but with some meaning and moral values.it manage on both counts.the lead are all good but especially the guy
who stars ,
also wrote
and produced the movie.i have never seen any of these actor before ,
but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end
which is saying
a lot.the script is clever
and involving and has a refreshing feel to it .
i think
you wont be disappointed to watch this .
