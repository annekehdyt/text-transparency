this is really a new low in entertainment .
even though there are a lot worse movie
out.in the gangster / drug scene genre
it is hard to have a convincing storyline
( this movie does not ,
i mean sebastian motive for example could not be more far fetched and worn out clich\u00e9 . )
then you would also need a setting of character relationship
that is believable
( this movie does not . )
sure tristan is drawn away from his family
but why was that again ?
what is the deal with his father again
that he has to ask permission to go out at his age ?
interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kid in upper class family .
but this movie does not go in this direction .
even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflash .
was not he already down and out ,
why does he do it again ?
so there are some interesting question ought up here for a solid socially critic drama
( but then again ,
this movie is just not ,
because of focusing on `` cool '' production technique and special effect an not giving the character a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path
where they want it to be
and not paying attention
to let the story eath and naturally evolve . )
it wants to be a drama
to not glorify abuse of substance and violence
( would be political incorrect these day ,
would not it ? )
but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie
( like there are so so many out there )
with an average set of actor and a vinnie jone
who is managing to not totally ruin
what is left of his reputation
by doing what he always does.so all in all i ..
just ... can not recommend it.1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing .
