many person have commented
that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first .
well 
maybe it is not - to you .
however 
how does your child react to it ?
well 
mine loved it
more than the first.disney movie of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kid .
( for example - bambi 's mother getting shot . )
this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl
who likes humor and happy endings.if
you want to be snobby about what should be disney 's standard
based on the past - skip this movie .
if you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy
you really want to please ,
buy this movie
and treat your small child .
this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dream instead of nightmare .
i am happy with a movie
that pleases my kid and does not need to impress the parent all the time .
