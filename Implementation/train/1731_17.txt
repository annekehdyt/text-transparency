even 20+ year later 
ninja mission stands out
as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through .
scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene ,
fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine gun with wild abandon ,
and then silently leave .
wow 
how will we find those silent invisible assassin ?
just follow the shell casing and smoke ! painfully bad dialog
( or was it illiant and just poorly translated ?
) 
not an asian in sight in the cast 
and a whopping total of 3 asian among the stunt crew .
the plot is ridiculous ,
the acting pretty much non-existent - then again 
ninja can not act !
save yourself - avoid watching at all cost !
