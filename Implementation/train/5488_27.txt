this is an excellent movie .
it is about many thing :
the hunt for a serial killer 
the bureacracy of soviet russia 
the drive of one man 
and the relationship between this man
( the lead detective )
and his superior.the thing
that sticks with me the most
is the relationship between durokov
( rea )
and fetisov
( sutherland )
( excuse bad spelling 
please ! ) .
for some reason 
it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense
turning into respect and cameraderie and working together .
one line in the movie sum it up for me :
`` he would say something witty ,
but he is overcome with emotion .
`` excellent acting by all of the cast ,
even the smallest part were done with believability.this is not a fast-paced action thriller ;
in fact 
it moves at time like a slow drama ,
but it is worth it .
very satisfying and not exploitative about the crime at all .
