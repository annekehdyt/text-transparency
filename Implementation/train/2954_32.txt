it takes a very special kind of person
to make a movie
that is so wretched 
beguiling 
disgusting and repulsive ,
but make it in a way
that also makes it illiant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation .
crispin glover 
in all of his `` out there '' antic and predisposition 
truly made something
that is unique .
in a world
that has become starkly partisan ,
this film seems to evade the standard line of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone .
right off the bat ,
the film takes on a rather distant paradigm
( if there really is a model at all )
and initially shapes it with the like of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked woman pleasuring a man with cereal palsy .
it is rather shocking stuff ,
but
if you had the opportunity for the qanda session after the screening ,
it clearly opens up a bag of worm
that leaves you wondering
whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator .
in either guise 
you sense the tremor
that this film will ultimately cause .
it will never be accepted 
not even by the supposed auteurs of the world
who boringly speak about the human condition .
you may not like it ,
but it is certainly something worth watching .
