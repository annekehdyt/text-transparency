that is right ,
you heard me .
i am a huge fan of jame patterson .
i own 10 of his book 
and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer .
in my opinion 
the screenwriter should be shot .
what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction
and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre ?
if i ever thought
that harry potter was butchered ,
then michael o'hara has proved me wrong .
i can only pray
that the next screenwriter
who tackles this fabulous book
will do it a great deal more justice .
to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy :
do not quit your day job .
