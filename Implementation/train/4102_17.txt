if the australiumn post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment
then this is it.this is one of those movie
who 's heart is in the right place
and you can watch again and again .
miranda 's performance is touching
as it shows an aspect of australium unimagined by many european ,
in that it can be cold 
wet and bleak ,
just like anywhere else
and just like anywhere else what is important is the person
that surrounds you .
the character in the movie are warm and welcoming
and make the prospect of a career move into a 'dead letter office ' a thought
to be considered .
miranda has gone on to do bigger movie ,
but i hope
she always keeps a thought inside for this one ? .
