*spoiler included*with a title like `` bleed '' ,
you know
the creative juice were not running on high
when this puppy was conceived .
the movie is your basic run-of-the-mill low-budget slasher movie .
oh sure 
it tries to be creative with the premise of the `` murder club '' ,
but we learn
that was just a joke anyway .
okay 
for those
who really care about these thing ,
the basic plot is that new girl in town start dating her co-worker .
he invites her into his circle of friend 
and at a party ,
they tell her
how they have a `` murder club ''
and they murder person 
blah blah blah .
well 
we learn
that it was all a joke ,
but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage .
now 
the `` member '' of the murder club are being killed one by one .
oh 
and the bad guy win
and the movie ends on a downer .
by that time 
you will not really care though.in retrospect 
the first 10 or so minute of this movie make no sense .
the motivation for the killing in the beginning of the movie is never explained .
i would say
that it was a way for the director to pad out the film ,
but on the dvd there are deleted scene !
i am not sure
why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of `` bleed '' ,
but apparently the person behind the dvd thought
the viewer would be clamoring for more .
on the box ,
it says
there are easter egg ,
but why the hell i would want to waste my time
looking for extra on this movie
is beyond me .
i was expecting a bad movie ,
and `` bleed '' delivered on that front .
it was not a fun bad movie though .
everyone looks good in the movie ,
and there is plenty of nudity ,
but the acting is just awful .
my least favorite character is the guy
who ends up being the killer ... i
think
he is supposed to be funny and amusing ,
but he just ends up coming off as a tool .
i think
the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage 
in a hilariously unconvincing death .
heroine shoves the woman into the parking garage cement pole ,
and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing ,
and she spits out a mouthful of blood 
and `` dy '' .
for those
who think
that movie making is an intricate ,
creative process
done by professional ,
check out `` bleed '' .
it will change your mind ,
and you will realize
any hack get can a movie made .
otherwise 
do not waste your time or money on this .
