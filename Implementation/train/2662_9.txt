lensman is a rather lesser-known anime gem from toho and mk studios.it is loosely based on the novel ,
but it reminds me more of the game `` metroid '' .if you want to see this ,
see it in japanese with subtitle or just plain japanese.the english dubbed version was almost cropped
and edited to death.there is not much new ,
despite the fact
that it is the 1st animated feature
to combine cg-graphic with hand-drawn animation ,
but it is fun to watch 
nevertheless .
