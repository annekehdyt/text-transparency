dragon fighter is the first sci-fi channel
( although i guess
it is now called syfy ? )
original movie i have ever seen .
but i have seen one or two other since ,
and i can tell you
that they were stupid ,
but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel .
the cgi is done poorly ,
the acting is bad ,
the script is ridiculous ,
and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place
( if you have seen dragon fighter ,
you probably know what i mean ;
i did not want to put a spoiler in my review ) .
plus 
there was this one musical tune
that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence .
that was really stupid ;
they just played it over and over .
and it is definitely not original ;
i know i have heard that somewhere
before ( i just can not remember where ) .
this is one to avoid .
