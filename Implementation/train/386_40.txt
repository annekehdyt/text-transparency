i am a huge michael madsen fan 
so needless to say ,
i bought this movie
without even renting it or anything ... this movie was so horrible ,
i did not even take it back to the store ,
i would not want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison ,
i just threw it in the trash ,
never mind the money ,
it was worth the price
to be able to throw it away .
the acting was not that bad ,
it was not good or anything .
the story was horrible ,
and the ending was something i despise .
he was a oken man 
alcoholic .
his life was a bunch of junk .
i thought
his horse 
peanut 
was an awful device
to show his childhood innocence ,
a dog would have been much much better .
i also hate religion 
so this ending
without a doubt angered me .
jesus heal all ... i hate
that i know person just like this
that are huge christian and catholic ,
and time will show
that god does not heal all 
or anything .
it was a horrible movie ,
if u have the option
to see it 
pass ,
or better yet buy it ,
or rent it ,
and throw it in the garbage ,
and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
