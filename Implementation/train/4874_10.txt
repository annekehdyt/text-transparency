the sun should set on this movie ,
forever.it goes on forever
( which is not usually a bad thing
- the english patient 
schindler 's list )
but is so tedious .
the aging of the actor is unbelievable
and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line
which really seems to go nowhere.in short 
a waste of talent and film .
