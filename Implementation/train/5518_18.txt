this film is about a family
trying to come to term with the death of the mother/wife by moving to genova 
italy.the plot of `` genova '' sounds promising ,
but unfortunately it is empty and without focus .
the film only consists of a collection of scene
depicting the daily life of the family 
such as swimming ,
taking piano lesson or cooking egg .
most of such scene are redundant and tiresome ,
completely failing to engage viewer emotionally .
the ending is very disappointing
as it is not spectacular 
moving or emotional .
i can safely say
that i am disappointed
and bored by `` genova '' the only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of genova .
`` genova '' can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city ,
but not as a film to be enjoyed .
