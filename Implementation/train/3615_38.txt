the word `` swedish '' and `` action movie '' do not mix .
that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt
made in the genre .
this is yet another failed attempt.lasse brunell
( shanti roney )
works at a military air base with top secret computer system .
one day foreign criminal threaten to hurt his family
if he does not do what they tell him .
they want the secret equipment
and will do anything to get it.this movie
has it is ups and down .
and usually in swedish action movie there are no `` ups '' 
just `` down '' .
so i guess something in this movie showed some quality .
to begin with the positive remark i can mention
that the movie is technically well made .
the footage of plane and helicopter flying are well shot
and look very nice .
the acting is of very varying quality .
shanti roney makes a decent performance
while marium bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual
( i wonder
how long swedish director are going to keep using her
even though she has the acting skill of a wooden plank ? ) .
stefan sauk is laughable as the `` cool '' special force man
who comes to the base to investigate.and what about the action scene ?
well as i said
above the scene of plane and helicopter flying are nice .
but aside from that there is not much action to talk about .
and that is a common problem with swedish action film .
there is just not enough action going on .
maybe it is a budget problem ,
maybe it is film-making culture .
i do not know ,
but it negatively affects the experience .
because quite frankly 
the story and acting is not good enough for this movie
to rely just on that.i rate this 4/10 for effort .
