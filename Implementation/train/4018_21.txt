i saw this movie with a bunch of friend
and although only two of us walked out of the cinema
thinking
how cool it was ,
the other just laughed and commented on how stupid it was .
well
that was because it is not supposed to be taken so seriously ,
basically it is a a movie
that mocks horror flick and does a damn good job.. there seems to be another movie coming out like that too 
umm ... scary movie ? ?
well this is aussie ,
and original ! ! !
jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kant has a definate ight future in acting !
i hope to see more of them .
molly ringwald was a good move ,
and kylie was an even better move .
the impossible princess was queen of the screen ! !
i recommend seeing this flick ,
as you will be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy 
hilary and the movie
that never got finished 20 year ago .
