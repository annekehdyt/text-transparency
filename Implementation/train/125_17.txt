horrible film with bit of the ramone strewn about .
your worse than average 1970's/80 's comedy format of the cool kid
taking over the school with some whimsical plan .
this movie is terrible .
the plot consists of a girl
who enjoys the ramone and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration .
forget this movie
and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf
if you want an entertaining b movie .
terrible acting ,
terrible writing ,
terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramone
who probably needed some money quick
so they said
yes to this movie .
that is the only logical thing i can think
of because this movie blows .
