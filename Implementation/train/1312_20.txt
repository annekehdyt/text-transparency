it was life-changing ,
it really was ! !
! the man in the moon is a eathtaking experience to watch.the acting was fabulous 
the story line was great ,
and this was a perfect start for reese witherspoon 's career.i do not see
how anyone could not love this film.sure ,
it is not the best movie ever ,
even though it was close to it ,
but it was highly amusing to watch 
and i even had a big laugh at one of the joke 
and a lot of other little laughs.of course 
there was some cry your heart out moment too ,
but this movie was enlightening ,
and it ightens up your day ,
although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now
and then.i can not believe
this movie did not win at least one award ,
and i also can not believe
that it is been seen by so little person on this site.see this movie
if you have not for it is definitely touching .
