i watched this hoping to find out something i didn`t
know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking
that history has been rewritten in hitler :
the rise of evil .
hitler was so obsessed with his niece
that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot .
hitler turned up with a gun in his hand
to arrest ernst rohm .
forgive me
for asking but haven`t the writer confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface ?
that`s bad enough
but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunk of historical context missing in this mini series .
germany lost the first world war
and the allied power made germany pay a heavy price
for doing so .
it was this economic environment
that led the german person to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why
they turned to nazism .
the german humiliation of the 1920s
caused by the allied power
seems to be entirely missing
therefore there is no way that hitler :
the rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document 
and i haven`t even mentioned
that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence
there is one positive point about the mini series and that`s robert carlyle in the title role .
okay some of his mannerism are wrong
and his voice is a little too loud
( archive recording show
that hitler had a soft seductive voice )
but carlyle is a charismatic actor
and he does manage to communicate hitler` own charisma on screen .
comment in the british press
that carlyle resembles the synth player from spark more than adolph hitler
are unfounded
and he gives one of the better interpretation of hitler.i liked the performance by robert carlyle
but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place .
there`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fan
