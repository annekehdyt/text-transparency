the only reason
i give
it a 2
is that filmography is so stylized these day such
that it has at least something
to comment on.this film is asinine .
it is like so many other 21st century grind house fodder .
the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting .
i did not care about any of the character ,
but i did care
that some cretin bothered to pen this crap :
i would complain about the money i spent 
but my date and i wisely left after 40 minute
and went to an adjoining theater
to watch the adventurous and entertaining `` live free or die hard 
''
which probably got a much higher rating from me
simply
because i endured the utter poop of `` captivity '' for 40 minute .
