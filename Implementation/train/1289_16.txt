go immediately and rent this movie .
it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store
and will be covered in dust .
no one will have touched it in year .
it may even be a $ .50 special !
it is worth ten buck 
i swear !
buy it !
there are not very many film
than can compare with this - the celluloid version of that goo
that form at the bottom of a trash can after a few year .
yes 
i gave it a '1 
'
but it really deserves much lower .
1-10 scale were not designed with stuff like this in mind .
