this movie is very cool .
if you are a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy film ,
you should love this .
this film is the asian lord of the ring :
a high fantasy story ,
based in actual chinese mythology .
( i realize
many critic have called this film plot-less ,
i think
they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology . )
if you liked stormrider or warrior of heaven and earth ,
this one should be right up your alley .
this film is still very difficult to find in the u.s. ,
even though it was purchased for u.s. distribution along with crouching tiger 
hidden dragon and iron monkey .
well worth the search ! ! !
this dvd is also worthy of owning .
