when i saw this movie ,
i could not believe my eye .
where these hilarious creature 
dustbin muppet with big pointy teeth 
really meant to be scary ?
or where they designed to have a good laugh
( i sincerely hope so ) .
if you watch carefully you can even see the string operating them
( better ;
dragging them across the screen ) .
the whole was rather funny than scary
and i had a good time
watching the movie
because i was amazed by its overall incapacity
to have only one good part .
it is one big joke from beginning to end
and i believe
this movie belongs into a new category :
so unbelievable crappy
you will be laughing from beginning to end .
( i am not even gon na try to comment on the acting or all the other thing )
