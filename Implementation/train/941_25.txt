this is a great movie .
i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink 
and the skeleton chase him ,
but luckily he dodged them ,
opened the window ,
and did not even notice them .
xiao qian is very pretty too .
and when he stuck the needle up ma wu 's butt 
its hysterical .
and when he is saying
love is the greatest thing on earth
while standing between two sword is great too .
then also the part where he eats his buns
while watching thew guy kill many person .
then you see him chanting poem
as he ran to escape the wolf .
the love scene are romantic ,
xiao qian and ning look cute together .
add the comic timing ,
the giant tongue 
and u have horror 
romance 
comedy 
all at once .
not to mention superb special effect for the 90s .
