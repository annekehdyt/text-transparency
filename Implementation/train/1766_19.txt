this film is horribly acted 
written 
directed and produced .
but it is so campy it is actually semi-watchable .
that is semi watchable.the storyline
( what little there is )
makes virtually no sense whatsoever .
the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie
and that gets tired after about 30 second .
many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials.. none of them went on to anything else
that i am aware of .
and of course sly stallone 's even less talented other well ... .. =\\trivia :
it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont 
ont .
( about 20 mile n.east of toronto )
i recognized many local landmarks/intersections/building .
i think
the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished `` oshawa drive-in ''
just before it was torn down .
