the only explanation i can muster
as to why this film is not widely distributed is
because it hits too close to home for some .
this movie was a genuine happy surprise ,
the satire is genius .
this film turns the light on in the dark
that is organized religion and big medium ,
and the roach scurry for cover .
rent the dvd and watch it for yourself
if you have not yet ,
this film succeeds
where many have failed
( dogma comes to mind )
to poke it is nose under the tent ,
both by using humor and very clever analogy coupled with telling backdrop and location .
can not comment in depth
without revealing some significan not spoiler ,
there are some surprise in this film
which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by .
