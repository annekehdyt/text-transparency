i am so confused .
i have been a huge seagal fan for 25 year .
i have seen all of his film 
and many of those dozen of time .
i can only describe this film as `` bizarre . ''
steven seagal share screenplay writing
and producing credit on this film ,
but i have a really tough time
believing
he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his line 
with a thin 
whiny imposter 's voice no less .
what i also do not get is ,
if they had to dub some of his line ,
why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ?
i expect seagal to age like the rest of us .
but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger 
confidence 
avado 
charm 
and sex-appeal
he so easily showed us in all of his previous movie .
what i found myself
missing most of all was his cocky 
self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer
that so easily shifts into that adorable grin .
where is that in-your-face attitude and charm
that made him such a huge star ? ? ?
i hope
that this film is not an indication
of what seagal has left
to offer us - if so ,
his lifelong fan will have to concede
that the seagal we all knew
and loved is gone .
