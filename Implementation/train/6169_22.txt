this is only the second time i stopped a video/dvd part way
through.i was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first ,
even though it managed to be both shallow 
clich\u00e9d and stupid.. and joyless 
plodding and pretentious.it was like an after school special
directed by that weird grade nine kid
who thinks
nobody understands him ... creepy and sad 
with voice-over narration
that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry ...
and some singing 
and ... no 
really 
the poor child 's suffering ... enough 
already ,
especially when it morphed into a azen 
clumsy 
and insulting clockwork orange ripoff .
and did i mention the singing ?
this is not the worst film i have ever seen ,
but certainly the one i have felt least compelled to sit through .
i do not recommend it to anyone .
