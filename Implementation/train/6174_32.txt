if you are a fan of zorro 
indiana jone ,
or action in general this is a must-see .
directed by republic 's ace team of william witney and john english ,
and starring reed hadley as don diego/zorro 
this serial deliver !
i will not bore you with the plot
( who cares ?
less talking 
more fighting ) ;
what really matter here is hadley 's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt .
***stunt spoiler follow ***you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg
-- zorro gets caught in the original version of the star war trash compactor in one chapter ,
trapped on a rope idge a'la temple of doom in another ,
does a raider horse-to-coach transfer
and even flee through a tunnel
while the baddy knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him ,
exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom .
in addition to all this 
the whip action is great as zorro disarm villain 
swing to safety 
etc .
with his trusty lash .
most of the sword work is fair to lame 
except for chapter one ,
which features a terrific sword awl in a can notina choreographed by sword/stunt legend ralph faulkner ,
who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez .
this was the first serial i ever saw 
on matin\u00e9e at the bijou
when i was a kid and i
have been hooked on them ever since .
zorro 's fighting legion deliver `` z '' good !
