i watched this movie for its two hour
and have absolutely no idea
what it is about .
somebody got murdered or maybe
they did not and maybe somebody did it or maybe
they did not .
this ought back memory of the good old day
( bad old day ? )
when all cbc canadian movie were stinker .
lately stinker have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism ,
mind reeling flash back and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time .
i have never found margaret atwood 's book easy to read .
this movie continues that fine canadian tradition .
it is not easy to watch .
maybe the trendy folk at the chi chi toronto cocktail party will pretend
they liked it .
us folk in the boony are a little less pretentious .
