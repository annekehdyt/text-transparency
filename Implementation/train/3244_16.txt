the film version of alice walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel
( written largely as letter from the central character celie to god )
was a massive oscar success ,
and rightly so.in the role of the abused and awakened celie ,
whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by mile .
not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia 
the fiery woman tamed by fate .
other in the cast fleshed out the character walker had introduced so clearly on the page - danny glover as albert 
celie 's abusive husband ; margaret avery as shug 
a force of change for the good ; willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak ; susan beaubian as corrine 
the preacher 's wife ; and the much-missed carl anderson
( otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar )
as preacher samuel.beautifully paced and sensitively written 
'the color purple ' does justice to its source
while opening out the story
to involve viewer of a feature-length drama .
