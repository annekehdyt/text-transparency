i only watched the first 30 minute of this
and what i saw was a total piece of crap .
the scene i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie .
no 
it was a hundred time worse .
ed wood has the reputation
of being the worst director
ever
but that is not true ;
the idiot
who directed this junk
is the worst director ever.the american cop
has a german accent !
the `` police station '' was a desk in a warehouse with a sign `` police station ''
hanging on the wall .
there is a fist fight
where the punch clearly miss by about ten feet.this cop pull woman over 
cuffs them
and leads them to a warehouse .
he tells his cop partner to wait in the car .
then he comes out of the warehouse
carrying a duffel bag .
the cop partner thinks
maybe something is not right ,
that his partner might be a bad cop
who is murdering these woman ,
but he is not sure
if that is what is happening
because - he is a moron !
the dialog is totally stupid ,
the acting is awful ,
and the character act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen .
it is totally obvious to the cop 's partner
that he is illegally abducting these woman
and he is slapping them
and taking them into a warehouse
and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it ,
and yet 
the partner ,
who is there all along ,
does not know what is happening !
the director of this film is a total hack .
i stopped the movie at 30 minute
because i could not take it anymore .
it has to be one of the worst movie i
have ever started to watch
and i will not waste anymore time
on it writing this review .
absolutely worthless .
