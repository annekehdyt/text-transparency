this one stood out
for it is originality .
i am seriously tired of seeing hindi movie
that are a hotch-potch of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movie .
some flaw were inevitable 
nonetheless ,
this movie is a must-see .
surya 's portrayal of the clean-cut 
conscientious cop
( as opposed to the pot-bellied ,
money-hungry one
that we normally see )
was awesome .
he is come a long way from his work in nerukku ner .
i liked the movie so much
that i had to own it .
i am not usually into the mindless violence type of movie ,
somehow i actually felt for each character
and therefore can not really ing myself to call it 'mindless ' violence .
i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scene
that go hand in hand with most hindi and tamil movie .
i absolutely loved this movie
for it is lack of the same .
acp anbuselvan 's reaction to loosing his wife 
is not overdone 
is heart-wrenching
and makes me want to bawl my eye out .
there are certain time
when i am watching a movie
when i want to hit the ff button .
plenty of time i have wanted to do that at a cinema hall .
never wanted to do so
when watching this movie .
i am really hoping that ghajini release soon .
