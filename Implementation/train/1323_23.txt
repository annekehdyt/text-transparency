well 
what can i say about this movie .
i am speechless .
i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing
that really pi*sed me off
was the music .
and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it .
to them all i have to say
is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial art movie of all time fistsof fury
starring bruce lee .
if he was still alive
and ever came across this movie
he had be horrified .
the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape .
i say
tape
because a movie like that could not possibly have been shot on film.i now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minute of my life
watching it .
the only reason
why i even saw
it
was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity .
what is this world coming to .
