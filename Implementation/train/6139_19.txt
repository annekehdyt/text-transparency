who framed him for murder.jack 's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that does not end until everyone is dead.through out the game jack uses weapon from m4 carbine to his dog shadow to kill endless stream of person in 15 levels.the game play is basically `` kill 30 person 
find switch to open door.kill 50 person 
find switch to open door '' over and over until the level is done.there are fun mini game too like
playing as a stripper to distract bouncer at a night club
so jack can get to another area in the club 
or bomb disarming.dead to right is also a hard game.you will be put in an area swarming with bad guy armed with sub machine gun
while you only have a pistol.near the end of the game skill turns to dust
and you have to rely on luck.dead to right is as gory
as it is hard.if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the wall 
ceiling and floor.and
since there are several guy in each area
the wall will be painted in blood.family fun for everyone .
