how low can someone sink
while trying to recapture an old glory ?
st :
hf will be glad to show you.if you are used
to seeing what made for a good star trek show ,
do not watch this.the writing
is hodge-podge 
the actor ' portrayal of their character weak 
and most of all 
the design work is downright doggy.like watching strong captain ,
do not look here !
like the strong federation attitude ?
forget about it here !
starfleet is mocked by ensign
wearing spike in their hair.while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffle
about and within two minute of the opening show 's credit 
ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer .
it just degrades from there .
no 
not even uniform match 
for goodness sake .
they are too small or too big ,
collars down to their chest 
and tng season one and two uniform mixed in with season three and ds9 uniform .
the strict discipline and tradition of any of the original in lacking in this production down to the tread !
the only good thing about this show is its graphic ,
which seem to improve a bit with each season .
ok 
i take that back .
who uses cg that inexpertly ?
the designer of this show.do not bother with it ,
it will offend your star trek sense ,
as it did mine .
not even the throw backs to previous show can save this catastrophe.i wept openly
when i watched this ,
probably because my eye were bleeding and my head almost ruptured .
that bad .
