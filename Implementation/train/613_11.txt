overall 
i agree wholly with ebert 's review .
in a sense 
i feel
that i should not even be commenting
since it is so much a vet 's movie and i am not a vet
( i was a resister ) .
the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped
and does not act consistently .
my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself
and spent too little planning time on her character .
