it is one of the best movie i have seen in the last 2 year
( i have seen the premier in tel-aviv 
israel in the summer of 2006 ,
exactly when the last war has began ... )
this problem in communication between the person ,
that causes war ,
is interesting me for a long time ,
and it does not matter who- boy and girl 
straight and gay 
jew and arab ... i have seen the bubble already 3 time ,
and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many person i know ,
and the difference between them 
like between tel aviv and jerusalem ... the last time i saw it- was with my friend ,
who is a christian arab ,
and it was on the independence day of israel
( the most symbolic i could !
how ironic )
and ... he cried in the end ! ! !
-
if he is been touched
and was not embarrassed- everyone would be touched by the bubble !
