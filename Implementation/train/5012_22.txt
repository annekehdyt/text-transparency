the film starts to slowly
when we got to the cinema
we thought
it looked quite good
but after about 5 min we were all bored out of our mind
and wondering what kind of film we had come to see ,
i do not like this film
and would not recommend it to anyone 
the best part of the night was
when the alarm and light came back on because the project oke down
because we thought
we could all go home .
this has to be one of the worst film i
have ever seen
we were all bored out of or mind
and most of the person in the cinema actually ran out of the door at the end
because it was so rubbish .
i am surprised
that no one walked out earlier than that .
if you go and see
it make sure you something to keep you busy ,
better still do not go and see it at all .
