i make a point out of watching bad movie frequently ,
and the sci-fi channel original movie tend to be one of the best source for these movie
you can find .
as such 
i am sure you can imagine my disappointment
when i saw sand of oblivion .
the acting was uncharacteristically sub-par ,
as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us .
there are a few cameos
made by person
you would most likely recognize ,
although you may not know their name by heart .
the cgi special effect are minimal ,
and as such 
one of the largest source of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking .
sure 
there are some funny moment
like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer ,
or when the main character leaves his friend to die
in order to save a girl
he is known for a couple of day ,
but overall ,
it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter ,
and i consider
that a major disappointment.if i was rating
it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for tv movie ,
i would probably give it a 4 
maybe even a 5. a real shame
that i may have to wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie
to get a good laugh ,
and i really hope
that this movie is not part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original movie .
