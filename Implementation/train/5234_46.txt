eleven different film maker from different part of the world are assembled in this film
to present their view
and idea about the wtc attack .
this is one of the best effort
you will see in any film .
film like this are rarely made and appreciated .
this film tries to touch every possible core of wtc .
here are some of the most important story from the film
that makes this film so unique.there is the story from samira makhmalbaf
( iran )
where somewhere in iran person are preparing for the attack from america .
there a teacher is trying to educate her student by informing them about innocent person
being killed in wtc massacre .
then comes a story from youssef chahine
( egypt )
where a film maker comes across face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier in the wtc attack and a dead hard core terrorist
who was involved in wtc attack .
then we see a story from idrissa ouedraogo
( burkina faso )
where a group of five innocent child 's see osama bin laden and plan to kidnap him
and win the reward money from america .
then we see the story from alejandro gozalez inarritu
( mexico )
where you see a black screen
and slowly you see the real footage of wtc building coming down .
and the person
who are stuck in the building
are jumping out of it to save their life .
the other most important story is from mira nair
( india )
where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son
whose name is falsely trapped in wtc massacre !
after september 11 attack 
our heart beat automatically starts pumping
if we hear two name anywhere in the world.. first is world trade centre
and the second is osama !
this film totally changes our perception
and makes a strong point
by claiming
something more to it.i will definitely recommend this movie
to everyone
who loves to have such kind of home dvd collection .
definitely worth every penny you spend .
but please do not expect anything more apart from film in this dvd .
there is of course filmography of the film maker
but no extra feature .
