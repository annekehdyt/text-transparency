the first film was a nice one ,
but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic
which i found more poignant and endearing .
this sequel is inferior ,
but not bad at all .
sure
the slapstick is too much ,
the script has its weak spot
and the plot is a tad uninspired .
but the dog are very cute here ,
and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw .
the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costume
( especially cruella 's ) ,
and the music is pleasant .
the acting is mostly very good ,
ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu
while he has given better performance has fun as cruella 's accomplice .
but the best asset ,
as it was with the first film ,
is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as cruella 
even more evil
than she was previously .
overall 
nice .
