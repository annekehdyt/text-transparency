i have to say
this is an awful movie ,
for the mere fact
that
when you see this movie on the guide ,
it is listed as a documentary .
as i watched it ,
i started laughing ,
thinking to myself ,
does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real ?
so i had to look it up ,
and now see
that it is a movie ,
but now since it is not a documentary ,
it is now a movie with bad acting .
so 
either way ,
it is pretty bad .
i actually did not make it to the end .
i had to shut it off .
i am a nyc police officer ,
and felt
that someone was trying to mislead person
into thinking this is a documentary 
with the intention of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworker .
so 
i took it a little personal .
maybe i was blinded by that ,
and it is not as bad
as i personally think
it is .
everyone has their own opinion .
