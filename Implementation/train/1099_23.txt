this has got to be the cheesiest 
stupidest 
most retarded monster film of all time .
it is a complete joke
that this even surfaced into theater .
this is sort of like
watching the loch ness monster in rural america .
this movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten .
john carradine 
shame on you .
the person
involved in this moronic pile of trash
need to be lobotomized .
wait !
maybe i am
giving them too much credit .
i am sure
they were lobotomized before the filming .
how else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity
that this bucket of crap contain .
do not waste a minute of your life watching this .
do not even waste your time
sending a review .
