i think
i should start this in saying
that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in part .
the true test is whether it is good from start to finish ,
which is the reason
i gave the analogical title for this review .
most of us would agree
-- even those like me ,
who enjoy reading many blog --
that blog can not compare with good novel writing for a number of reason .
likewise 
fem can not compare with good film
making for a number of reason ,
and i actually believe
it is a poor example of independent filmography .
from start to finish ,
fem feel like a pieced together vlog .
( heck ,
even myspace gets some pimping . )
if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15
-- i do not --
i would go watch it .
fem ,
while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned medium ,
is so personal
that it is without an interesting story .
it is like watching the mundaneness of life ,
which
i think
most would agree is very naturally boring .
and yet the creator of fem want us to applaud it ,
their very postmodern film about making a film .
cue my yawn.ultimately 
i come away not caring the least bit about any of it .
i am shocked
that i am actually interested in taking time out
to write this review 
even .
it is not that fem is downright bad ,
because it is not ;
it has a few moment
where i crack a smile or think
that maybe
-- just maybe --
something of interest is about to happen .
it is rather that it is just downright ... mediocre .
i feel so indifferent about it
that it is almost fitting of an oxymoron :
passionate indifference.i hope
the creator/ '' actor '' in the film get out of debt from their effort .
they will probably need it for when one of them move out and move on with life.see this movie
if you have got time to waste
and nothing much you want to do ;
otherwise ,
pass it by ,
and do not worry
that you have missed some great 
undiscovered talent .
you really have not .
