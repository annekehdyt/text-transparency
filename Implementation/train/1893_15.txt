i had nowhere to go .
i was on a flight to vancouver .
i would probably have missed this film
if i had not chosen air canada .
watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front ,
i found this captivating and mesmerising .
i did drift in a couple of place
and had to skip back
but i had to watch to it is end .
now i am looking forward to the dvd release in europe
though whether i will be quite as transfixed
when i can walk out the door ,
is yet to be discovered !
the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out ' the story the photographs tell.recommended
( if you have time on your hand ) .
