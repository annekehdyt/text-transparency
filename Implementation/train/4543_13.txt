`` hak hap '' 
or `` black mask ''
( in english )
was a disappointment .
i was told
that it was a sort of `` japanese version of the matrix '' .
imagine my disappointment .
the film was either badly
dubbed or the soundtrack did not time well with the film .
another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad .
there was very little thought put into the english version of this film
and it appeal only to the `` senseless action '' genre .
not a film i would want to see again .
