here is another film
that does not really need much of a recommendation .
it is a classic comedy 
very funny and entertaining and which 
of course 
ultimately inspired a successful television series
which many would say
was even better
( i enjoy both 
personally ) .
for some 
it is hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison
when they were were weaned on the tv show
starring tony randall and jack klugman
( or perhaps vice versa ) .
but what we have got there in both case are four good actor
who in real life seemed so much like their film counterpart
that they managed to make these characterization their own .
it is neil simon 's humorous material
that is key ,
and where the laugh really originate from.for those
who have somehow never heard of the odd couple ,
it is the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak
( lemmon )
who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife
and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy
( matthau ) .
pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four wall makes for some hugely funny predicament .
