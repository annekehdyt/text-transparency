i love dracula
but this movie was a complete disappointment !
i remember lee from other dracula film
from when i was younger ,
and i thought
he was great ,
but this movie was really bad .
i do not know
if it was my youth
that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula 
with style 
looks 
attraction and the evil underneath that .
or maybe it was just this film
that disappointed me .
but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language
to go along with it ?
do you like
when a plot contains unrealistic choice by the character
and is boring and lacks any kind of tension.. ?
then this is a movie for you !
otherwise - do not see it !
i only gave it a 2
because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.sorry
but
if you liked this movie
then you must
have been sleep deprived
and home alone in a dark room with lot of unwatched space behind you .
maybe alone in your parent house or in a stranger home .
cause not even the character in this flick seemed afraid ,
and i think
that sums up the whole thing !
or maybe you like this film
because of it is place in dracula cinema history ,
perhaps being fascinated
by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today .
cause as movie
it is not that appealing ,
it does not pull you in to the suggestive mystery
that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating .
and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70y feel about it .
the scenery looks like cheap theatre .
and i do not say
that rejecting everything made in the 70y .
cause i can love old film as well as new .
