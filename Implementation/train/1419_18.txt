this ranks as one of the worst movie i have seen in year .
besides cuba and angie 
the acting is actually embarrassing .
was not archer once a decent actress ?
what happened to her ?
the action is decent but completely implausible .
the make up is so bad
it is worth mentioning .
i mean ,
who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film .
someone should tell the make up artist ,
and the dop
that you are not supposed to actually see it .
the ending is a massive disappointment - along the line of `` and then
they realized
it was all a dream ''
do not waste your time or your money .
you are better off just staring into space for 2 hour .
