- i had planned to write something
explaining what i did not like about this movie ,
but this is going to be more difficult than i thought .
honestly 
i can not remember much about it .
i watched it just three day ago
and it is made almost no impression on me .
that is usually the sign of a real stinker .
about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it .
the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look-a-like
as the detective wore off real quick .
it would be different
if he could act ,
but he is a one-note entertainer .
the kill scene were amateurishly handled
and there was no suspense leading up to them .
if you can not spot the killer five minute into the movie ,
you need to see more euro horror .
the casting is a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
