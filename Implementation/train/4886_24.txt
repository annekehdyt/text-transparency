this is one of the funniest movie i
have ever seen .
i rented it as a joke ,
expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scene ,
and let me just say
i have never laughed so hard in my life .
the first scene
where ninjas randomly pop out of the air
and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moment of my life .
this is not a dinosaur movie ,
but more a movie
that makes fun
( and does not mean to at all )
of the action genre .
i did not see the first two ,
but judging by the complexity of the plot ,
i do not think
there is to much i missed .
if you wan na see a movie
that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy ,
than i insist you rent this movie
and sit back
and watch a 100 year of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash
and get shat on by carnosour
