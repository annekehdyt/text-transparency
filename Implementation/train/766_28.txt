this has to be one of the worst movie of all time .
the graphic were horrendous ,
the acting was b-movie
and the effect were just plain nintendo 64 qualified .
you would think
that they would put a little more effort into it .
of course 
it is a scifi channel movie
so you have to expect it to be low rate ,
but this one takes the cake .
hell 
i am still laughing .
so 
as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie 
this one does well .
although it appears to have some 'known ' actor and actress in this ,
it is difficult for me to believe
that they did not realize
that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort .
the graphic might have been good in the '60 's or even early '70 's
but come on 
this is 2009 !
i wont give spoiler out ,
let 's just say
that
if you have played `` jurassic park '' on the nintendo 64
you will be very familiar with what you see in this filmit is definitely not worth the 2 hour
it took to sit through the thing
