artimisia was on late last night .
at first i did not think
i would like it ,
but seeing i did not feel like sleeping yet
and nothing else being on ,
i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia 
a virgin 
pure and passionate .
her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feeling .
even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality ,
i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama 's .
great play 
great camerashot 
great music and texts .
i loved it
and i want more of it !
