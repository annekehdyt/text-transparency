now my friend 
film like `` la b\u00eate ''
( aka `` the beast '' or `` o monstro '' )
only can be done in the old continent : ) ,
in this film we see all :
horse dirty sex 
nymphomaniac kind off gorilla 
non sense dialog 
etc 
etc 
etc ... in the serious term now 
its an allegory 
that man sometimes could be bestial 
visceral and utal 
walerian borowczyk
( the director )
shows us the loss of innocence 
sexual violence 
rape and utality .
its a astonishing cinematic experience 
bizarre and full of grotesque scene .
for all fan of european shocking exploitation 
i recommand this film.if you like this one i recommand :
`` orloff against the invisible man '' and `` alterated state '' .
