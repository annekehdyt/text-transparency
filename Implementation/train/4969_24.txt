i saw it in a posh movie theater
where the audience is usually white 
educated 
and urban .
the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african-american ,
and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two group a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relation in this country .
basically 
the white folk were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bit
-- and there are many !
-- because they had be `` laughting at black '' ,
while the black also stayed pretty silent
because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the white .
i 
on the other hand 
being asian
( and thus belonging to neither group ) ,
had a great time
viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophy .
the cast is talented
and does at great job becoming the character portrayed .
the song are too funny
to be believed.this film is one of the best pseudo-documentary
to come along ,
including `` a mighty wind ''
