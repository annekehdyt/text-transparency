this film deserves another bad review .
consider one reviewer extolling the film 's virtue
that include 'no sex 
violence or gore . '
uh 
excuse me .
the very set-up of the film has us watching as cody 's young comrade 
with love of life
and who has everything to live for is blown to bit leaving cody holding his lifeless 
bloody body .
and 
given the nature of war we know
that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis .
so much for those
viewing this film with such rose glass
that the violence
which defines cody 's persona
is erased from viewer memory.san any family of his own cody 
like john rambo 
roams the country on his bike
making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place
called nevada city .
no mention 
no realization of the clear fact
that cody is damaged good .
we know
this since his co practically declares him so
as he order cody to 'get some rest ' away from the death and destruction of war .
this explains ,
as none seem to notice or care 
cody 's obvious 'flat ' effect .
it is not bad acting .
it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder .
not guessing here 
remember his co ordered him off the battle field.how about that 'accidental ' kiss
as noted by another review .
the fall was an accident ,
the kiss was not .
how exactly was cody 'respecting ' faith
by hitting on her knowing full well
she was spoken for ?
now that was a non-family value moment .
a moment
which is then announced to the immediate universe
as if posted on youtube .
of course faith 's lapse of fidelity as well as cody 's 'coming on ' to a woman
who plan to marry another
is received in the spirit of the xmas season ,
all cheering their cheaten ' heart and lips.we know little about faith 's fianc\u00e9
except
that she professes her love for him ,
she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal
( could have waited
if any second thought ) ,
he is generous ,
he loves her to death ,
the family has nothing really against him ,
he believes
marriage is based on compromise
and the two have never discussed post marriage plan .
no evil doer here.asner is a fine actor
given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son ... .
' 'you are part of our family ' literally day
after they have met a stranger
named cody .
and the 'band of other ' speech
where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual stranger off the battle field.bottom line :
this film is cotton candy xmas fluff
that betrays itself in major way .
most grossly
when it applauds cody 's disrespect for faith
by physically hitting on her knowing full well
she is spoken for .
by re-defining family
as we know it to wit :
accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family
because we all 'love you . '
how many of you have done that
or know anyone
who has done that .
not .
