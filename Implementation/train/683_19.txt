mr. blanding builds his dream house may be the best frank capra/preston sturge movie
neither man ever made !
if you love bringing up baby ,
the philadelpia story 
the thin man 
i was a male war bride
or it is a wonderful life - movie
made with wit 
taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek ,
check this one out .
post wwii life is simply and idyllically portrayed.grant is at the absolute top of his form
playing the city mouse
venturing into the life of a country squire .
loy is adorable as his pre-now wife .
the cast of supporting character compares to you can not take it with you
and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker .
art direction and editing are way
above par.the movie never stoops to the low-rent 
by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit .
