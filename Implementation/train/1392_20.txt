i rented this dvd for two reason .
a cast of great actor 
and the director 
even though robert altman can be hit or miss .
in this case 
it was a big miss .
altman 's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester .
after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like `` dead again '' ,
i did not think
he could possibly contribute to such a turkey ,
and i hope
it did not ruin his reputation .
robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time oscar winner .
on a downward spiral
that includes acting in eating-money film such as this one .
duvall was once a great actor in excellent film ,
even though his best performance was not `` tender mercy '' ,
but `` the great santini '' .
this movie was truly a big waste of time .
i give it a 2/10 .
