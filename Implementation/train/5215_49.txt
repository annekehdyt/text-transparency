from a modern sensibility 
it is sometime hard to watch older film .
it is annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower liarian
have to take off her glass
and become pretty and stupid to win a man .
especially such a shallow and inconstant man .
he is obviously a player
( i would not trust him to stay true to her )
who does not want to settle down ,
who only looks at dumb attractive woman
and always calls them `` baby ''
( ick ! ) .
even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him ,
he only goes to her after
he is ( supposedly )
rejected by another woman and learns
that connie spent all her money
renovating a boat for him .
i wanted her to stand up to him 
not pathetically chase after him !
his sudden conversion within a few minute was totally unrealistic
and did not work for me.apart from that subplot 
i did like the movie .
how can you not like sailor dancing with each other ? !
( you can tell
they were from san francisco ... . ;
d )
the `` rehearsal '' dance was great ,
watching ginger roger purposefully fall in and out of the `` correct step '' was great .
the last dance scene `` face the music '' with the beautiful costume
and the art deco set was beautiful .
and i really enjoyed `` we saw the sea ''
( though they did use it a few too many time ,
as if
they realized
it was their best song ) .
anyway 
the plot was a bit weak 
like most musical
( imo )
- and the song were ok ,
but the dancing was worth watching the film for .
i wish
they could have showed some shot of san francisco
since
that was were the film
was supposedly set.it is also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge
of what hitler was already doing at that time .
i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land .
