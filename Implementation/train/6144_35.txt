perhaps disney was hoping for another mary poppin
but this is a very different story
and while angela is delightful
she was a very different performer to the great julie andrew .
having said
that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance .
there is something deliciously dotty about her character
and she is given wonderful support by david tomlinson .
tomilinson can carry a tune
but he is certainly not much chop as a singer .
it does not matter
he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice .
there are some great cameos from much loved star of another time like roddy mcdowel
who gives a winning performance and the much loved tessie oshea
who does very little but its nice
to see the old gal again .
its also lovely to see sam jaffe and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small role .
the score has a couple of beautiful song especially the iny sea and the age of not believing .
the big number portabello road is stretched to the limit
but it has plenty of theatricality .
the effect look a bit clich\u00e9 today
but the scene with the german invader
being attacked by the wildest army in film
is pretty impressive .
the kid are not as annoying as other movie
but one does struggle
to understand
what the youngest boy is saying .
i loved the marching song of the home army .
the home guard were very important to britain
and this is a warm tribute .
the animation is delightful 
much better than pixar
which i find grotesque .
a warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage .
