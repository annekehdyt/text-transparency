what happened to peter bogdanovich ?
once a illiant director 
a trail blazer ... is now scraping the very bottom ... is this the same man
who directed `` the last picture show '' ?
here 
he takes a somewhat interesting
( albeit farfetched )
premise ,
and turns it into bubble gum
that loses flavor the moment
you take the first bite ... dunst
is not bad ,
but izzard is miscast as chaplin ,
and all the other actor seem to have been cast for their `` look '' ,
and not because they were right for the part .
too bad .
i will go rent `` paper moon '' again .
