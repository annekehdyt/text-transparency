well 
one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was .
gutsy would be the right term .
not only did he use a total cast of five person
( no extras at all ) ,
but he also decided to use sub-par special effect with a confusing and boring plot ,
he also ,
and i am not kidding 
put a warning at the beginning of the movie
that you might die of fright ! ! !
however 
they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn .
to have a creepy limping gardener
is always a good move .
yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn ... .if you watch mystery science theater 3000 ,
you might 've seen this .
they like to showcase horrible movie ,
just to let you know.a good gift for someone you hate .
