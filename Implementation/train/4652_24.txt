do not even waste your time ,
let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck !
how it got made is beyond me .
( i do not know
why there is a minimum of 10 line ... i have already summarized this trashy movie 
but 
oh well ... )
the acting was awful ,
like they all needed lesson .
the plot was weak ,
the ending ... feh !
i think
the cinematography was the only thing
that did not totally suck ... well ,
maybe the sound was minimalistically ok. the one good thing is ,
if they could make this movie ,
even make some money with it ,
there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea .
so 
you-all take heart !
i guess the same holds true of actor ...
if these person actually got paid ,
then you can ,
too !
