i have watched this movie twice ,
and i plan to see it again .
it is the movie
that puts you in the director 's place ,
regarding his romantic relation and the political situation in israel .
it also makes me cry
because of remembering the wonderful time it was ,
and the horrible murder described there .
it is really worth watching .
