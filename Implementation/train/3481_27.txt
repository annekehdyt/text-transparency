has the maturity and fortitude
to sustain the family in the face of adversity .
the kid grow up ,
one all be it 
in the hard way ,
to realize
that no matter how old they or a parent is ,
the parent still loves their child
and are willing to provide them a cushion
when they fall .
all the actor portraying their character did outstanding performance .
