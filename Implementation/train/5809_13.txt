it is like what the title of this thread say .
only impression i got from that movie is that marlee matlin 's character was always angry 
so cynical 
and so pathetic .
her character 's first date with william hurt 's character
where they were dancing
were dumb .
all in all 
i have tried to finish watching the movie four time ,
and of all four time i fell asleep .
i would keep watching that movie with one intention ... to beat my problem with insomnia ,
because all it do is to put me to sleep .
sweet dream .
