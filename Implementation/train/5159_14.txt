i will never forget
the night i saw this movie .
we were on a submarine on patrol in the north atlantic
and this was the scheduled movie of the evening .
we all gave up after the second reel .
they did not even try to show it at the mid-night showing .
opting for a rerun instead ... ... this is all i really have to say
but they have this stupid rule
that my comment must contain ten line .
i am not supposed to pad the comment with random word
so i will just continue to ramble until i get my ten line of bs .
i could not find george goble listed in the credit
but i remember him in the movie .
the sining was terrible and the song even worse .
