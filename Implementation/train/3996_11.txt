this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget .
dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid ,
chase scene are uniformly boring ,
and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crash and explosion in a parking lot during the film 's last five minute
( a iefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film 's chief villain
-- no prop is here
without a purpose ) .
the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those
that occasionally came out of rodger corman 's studio
when he had give a first time director a few buck and a camera
-- but without the discipline corman would impose .
