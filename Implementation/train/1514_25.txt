i remember this movie .
quite intense for an 11 year old .
good editing 
i felt terrible for the st. bernard .
i would watch it again
if it were reoadcast ,
but the signal is passing pluto as i write this .
robert culp .
a highlight of his career .
i am
just glad i did not live in that neighborhood .
oh those 70 's .
what a decade .
if they remade it i bet
it would be very violent and bloody .
so what are they waiting for ?
an excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boy .
it was very intense .
i think
it was filmed in los angele .
certainly not made in lodi nj .
the shot with the st bernard was the best
and obviously the most haunting image from the film ...
and then they left the carcass on the stoop .
rotten kid .
