there is not more i can say
that saying
this film was awful .
the whole chineseness is awakened in your
being because of the ancestor was a hard sell .
but telling the audience that every chinese know chinese history
without even studying it just laughable .
that is like saying every american know american history
without studying or every filipino 
etc 
etc .
it just is not believable.the story is flat out hideous .
it talked about shin being from a monastery in china -
later identifying it from bejing .
however 
the early sequence of the film show the map
focusing in on mongolia .
i know
the current chinese regime wants to claim area like mongolia for its own 
granted .
but its a distinct nation and it even labels `` mongolia '' on the map .
did disney studio fail 5th grade geography ?
the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best ,
and yet she somehow feel connected to him .
her training is just cheesy as well .
and 
lets cut to the chase :
everything about this film is bad .
its bad enough to laugh at and cry over .
the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.the evil eye thing was cheesy .
however 
the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it .
they should have left the evil eye ending in it .
but instead somehow evil is defeated .
yey !
overall 
not worth the time of the dog in the film .
brenda song should get on with another studio .
