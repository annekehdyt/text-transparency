i do not know anything of the writer 's or the director 's earlier work
so i had not ought any prejudice to the film .
based on the ief description of the plot in tv guide i thought
it might be interesting.but implausibility was piled upon implausibility .
each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse
to drag in more bloodshed 
gruesome makeup 
or special effects.the score was professional
and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress
but the rest was more than disappointing .
it was positively repulsive.i will not go through the vagary of the narrative
but i will give an example of what i think
of as an excess of explicit gore.chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house
and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim
( wendt )
out of the deep freeze .
mckenna had killed wendt
by biting a chunk out of his neck .
now he feels
he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt 's demise .
( what are the cop going to do ,
measure his bite radius ? )
mckenna unwraps wendt 's head and neck from the freezer bag
it is in ,
takes an ax ,
and begins to chop off wendt 's head .
whack .
whack .
whack .
the bit of the ax keep chipping away at wendt 's neck .
the air is filled with nugget of flying frozen flesh ,
one of which drop on mckenna 's head .
( he ushes it off
when he is done . )
mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire
he is built .
he sits the head on the ground 
squat next to it ,
takes out some photo of a woman
he is just killed ,
and shows them to wendt 's head .
`` remember her ?
we could have really made it
if it had not been for you guys 
''
he tells the head .
`` duke 
you have always liked bonfire ,
have not you ? ''
he asks .
then he places the head on the fire .
we only get a glimpse of it burning
but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.i do not want this sort of garbage
to be censored .
i am only wondering
who enjoys seeing this stuff.there is no reason to go on with the rest of the movie .
well 
i will mention one example of an `` implausibility 
''
since i ought the idea up .
mckenna has been kidnapped
and locked in a dark bare shack .
he knows
he is going to be clobbered half to death in the following day .
( he is literally invited the heavy to do it . )
what would you do in this poe-like situation ?
here is what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life .
he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbate
( successfully ) .
give
that man the medal of freedom !
a monster
who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashback .
the camera is often hand held and wobbly .
the dialog has line like ,
`` life is a piece of s*** .
or else
it is the best of all possible world .
it depends on your point of view . ''
use is made of a wide angle lens
that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle mask .
a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end
while the hero 
mckenna 
walk towards us in the foreground.some hero he is 
too .
he first kills a man for $ 13,000 by bashing him over the head several time with a heavy statue 
then a potted plant ,
before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body .
( this bothers him a little ,
but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment . )
then 
i hope
i have the order straight ,
he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck .
then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident
and blames the heavy for it ,
although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it .
next he burns the head honcho
( baldwin )
alive .
then ,
having disabled the two lesser heavy ,
he deliberately blows them up ,
though one of them is not entirely unsympathetic .
and we are supposed to be rooting for mckenna.these are not cartoon death like those in the dirty harry movie
either
-- bang bang and you are dead .
these are slow and painful .
the first one
-- the murder for $ 13,000 --
is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life .
it is not really easy to kill another human being ,
as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain .
but that scene leads to no place of any importance.some person
might enjoy this 
especially those young enough
to think
that pain and death are thing
that happen only in movie .
some meretricious stuff on screen here .
