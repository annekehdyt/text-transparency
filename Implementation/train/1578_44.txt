prom night is about a girl named donna
( brittany snow )
who is being chased by a psycho killer trying
to kill her at her prom night .
and by doing so killing her family 
friend 
and her enemy .
now before i begin let me say
have you been tired of pg-13 horror movie
that have not been scary lately .
are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'oh my god '
and talking about girlish thing .
and are you really tired of girl in relationship and then crying .
and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian 
japanese 
and chinese film .
that pretty much sum up prom night
but i am still not done with the review.the only reason to see 'prom night '
is to crack a laugh at the kill .
if not 
do not see prom night .
you never see the kill an only hear screaming
and you see some blood on the wall .
and by the way the death are repeating like 24/7 .
so not only are not they scary but it is obnoxious .
by the time i met the cast i think
i was ready to hurl .
too much girl talk ,
too much guy talk 
and lot of 'oh my gosh .
it is our prom ' .
i understand
it is fun
but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate .
if i were to put prom night on the list of worst film of 2008
without seeing the other film i would be the first one too .
i am not going to be surprised
if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick .
seriously do not spend your money or the time for dull acting 
cheap scare 
and a 'night to die for '
when watching the film.1 star out of 10 .
( p.s .
if i could give the film zero star i would ) .
