typical troma-trash 
this smutty 80 's flick is considered one of the `` highlight '' of lloyd kaufman 's notorious production studio ,
alongside `` the toxic avenger '' released one year earlier .
`` the toxic avenger '' is far superior
if you ask me ,
but this demented splatter-flick is nevertheless endurable as well ;
just make sure
you leave your full ain capacity at the door .
the event take place in tromaville 
a little town
that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world ,
and they certainly are not lying .
the safety precaution in the local nuclear power plant are substandard ,
to say
the least
( even homer simpson never was this nonchalant )
and toxic waste seep through to the nearby high school .
the first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd ,
who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavity ,
but his death is believed to be an accident
because he had no less than two microwave oven in his house !
oh 
the humanity !
shortly after 
however 
the nuclear leak also affect the school 's weed plantation
and thing really start to get messy .
after smoking a joint at a party ,
the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster
that settles in the basement and feed on teenage scum .
`` class of nuke 'em high '' is bottom-of-the-barrel horror film-making 
with dialog
so dumb they hurt your ears and make-up effect
that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless .
if you enjoy watching faces melting away ,
getting crushed or splitting in half ,
this is definitely a must-see !
unlike the aforementioned `` the toxic avenger '' 
this film suffer from a couple of really dull and overlong moment
where nothing really significan not happens ,
like for example when chrissy and warren try to figure out what is wrong with their hormone .
the crude humor is not as effective as in `` toxic avenger ''
and the acting performance are unforgivably amateurish .
proceed only if you are an avid troma-fanatic .
