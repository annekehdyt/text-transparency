when i first heard about this movie i
thought
it would be like the duchess
( 2008 ) ,
but
when i saw the first 30 minute of the young victoria i knew
this
would not just be a solid movie .
almost everything in this movie is great ,
the costume are really amazing
and the setting are also beautifully shot.the only thing
that really let me down are the performance .
emily blunt
( the devil wears prada )
is the star of the film 
inging victoria to life and with this movie
she shows
that she is a great actress
and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance .
rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert
but he has great chemistry with emily blunt .
paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne
although i expected more of him .
jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting role
but are forgettable.to me the film feel like unfinished .
maybe
that the screenwriter changed too many thing in the script ,
i do not know
but that is how i feel about the movie.but overall
it is a great movie about the early year of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt .
