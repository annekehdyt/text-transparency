what can one say about a film
that has one of the blackest 
most nihilistic ,
and occasionally most weirdly -i wont say
'sympathetic'..i will say 'charismatic ' villain in the history of the cinema 
and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbank were in their heyday ?
this is an epic about a stubborn 
sometimes foolish 
incredibly courageous and honest man fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny .
i loved it .
john hurt and tim roth were great villain .
jessica lange was very moving 
tender 
and sensual .
