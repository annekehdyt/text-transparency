keep in mind i am a fan of the genre
but have only recently seen this film for the first time .
how i have overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me .
to me this is a better film then the much lauded `` high noon '' .
it is a great western with excellent acting and a great story .
the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography .
if you like western or jame stewart this film is not to be missed .
