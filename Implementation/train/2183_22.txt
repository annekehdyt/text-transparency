this is an amazing film 
both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing 
and from the unique way
that the filmmaker interweave the story of the stage production with the life of the character
preparing for it .
spellbinding is the only word i can use
to describe the experience .
this is not 'bizet 's carman ' by any usual standard .
this is not a usual film by any standard .
every nuanced glance 
every stomp of the foot 
every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly
that you can not take your eye off the screen .
you do not need to love opera or flamenco
( i do not )
to be captured 
enraptured 
enthralled by this film .
subtle and direct ; loud and still ; one of 
if not the best ,
movie of it is kind ,
because there are so few like it .
