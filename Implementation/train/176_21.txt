david mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director .
his first movie 'house of game ' was the one i liked best ,
and it set a series of film with character
whose perspective of life change
as they get into complicated situation ,
and so does the perspective of the viewer.so is 'homicide '
which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama .
the principal character are two cop 
one jewish and one irish
who deal with a racially
charged area .
the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war triggers the jewish identity in the mind
and heart of the jewish detective.this is were the flaw of the film are the more obvious .
the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe ,
the group of jewish militant is operatic ,
and the way
the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation
is pathetic .
the end of the film itself is mamet-like smart ,
but disappoint from a human emotional perspective.joe mantegna and william macy give strong performance ,
but the flaw of the story are too evident to be easily compensated .
