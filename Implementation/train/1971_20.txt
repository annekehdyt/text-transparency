i was dragged to this movie about four year ago by a french actress friend of mine.for
the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood 
hating this film ,
hating myself
and even hating the french actress .
and then ... i do not know
what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way
that i had not been in year .
and this was despite the fact
that one of the projector oke and they had to do each changeover by hand .
i was in the theater for close to four hour ,
but it was worth it .
i believe
that great movie pull you inside a world ,
make you a part of it
and then drop you off to talk
about with your friend over coffee or a drink .
this film did that .
it was one of the best filmgoing experience
i have ever had .
