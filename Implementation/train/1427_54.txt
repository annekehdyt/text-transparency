highly implausible 
unbelievable 
and incoherent spanish production about ... well 
let me see
just how close i can get to it .
the film opens with a woman
having one of her cat 's killed by a young girl .
she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation .
he calls work and demand
that he loses his vacation time
and she says
he will pay for this .
what relevance this plays out to is anybody 's guess at the film 's end ,
because the guy 
a swarthy photographer 
spies a beautiful patty shepard 
queen of spanish horror film
it seems ,
taking her bikini top off momentarily
so he can snap a picture ,
ask her out to lunch ,
and then to his assignment to witch mountain - for reason again we are never privy to .
before they go ,
patty must stop by the house and loud 
`` eerie '' chanting echo in our hero 's ears .
again 
this is never explained .
the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn ,
going on to the mountain ,
and finally realizing why
the mountain is called witch mountain .
you know ,
there are several aspect to this film
which make it better than a bad film .
it has some atmosphere ,
some of the character actor are really quite good
( especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman ) ,
the lead are at least adequate ,
and the climax -
though it makes absolutely no sense at all -
is well-choreographed
( literally )
with the witch in white assiere and long black hair .
it just does not make any sense though ,
and that is a huge detractor to me .
i could watch the film another ten time
and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing .
that is a major problem .
the witch mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap 
atmospheric european horror film
that blanketed that decade .
if you can get more out of it than me 
better power
to you .
