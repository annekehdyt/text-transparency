let 's be honest .
as a film school project 
made
without budget and `` real '' actor ,
this is a passably interesting film .
as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer ,
it is a very poorly produced product .
if i would be idly changing channel
and happened to catch this film accidentally ,
it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while .
as a person
who bought this dvd under the impression
that i would be getting a proper cinematic product 
i.e .
a film 
i feel deeply disappointed .
it is a videotaped tv play ,
something along the line of old sixty serial ,
but without that certain charm .
aside from the leading man mr redfield
( who also is the director ) ,
the other actor seem to be either chap from the campus
( a bit too old for that actually ) 
or member of the director 's household ,
who appear before the camera
without any help from not only the acting couch ,
but also the make-up artist or hairdresser
( a bonnet over outgrown permanent bang or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s ) .
it is all shot
using a motionless mounted camera in a small 
bare studio ,
sometimes using blue screen for outdoor background .
synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame `` period '' inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewer ears on more than one occasion .
the film attempt
to be `` dreamlike '' ,
wherea in fact it is merely conceptionless collage of those shot
that made it to the editing
( and believe me ,
the standard were not too high
to start with ) .
there are interesting dialog every now and then ,
but overall it is pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flash of genius from either the director or any member of the crew .
that is how `` artsy '' film attempted to look in the 80s .
mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director .
