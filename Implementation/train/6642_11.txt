`` houseboat horror '' is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made
and described as a typical slasher film ,
which carried the promotion 'see the movie
that can not get an academy award'.an underground disco band member begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac
as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback.badly acted
and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.it certainly delivers the gore :
head are split in half with a machete ,
throat are cut
and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.if you like cheesy slasher movie
you can give this one a try ,
but you have been warned.at least it is better than swedish `` the bleeder '' .4/10 .
