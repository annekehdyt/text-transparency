hobgoblin ... what a concept .
rick sloan was a master with this film .
he had the illiance
to produce a film with actor
that could not act .
on top of that 
he chose to write a script
based on some sort of bad acid trip
gone serriously wrong .
put it together ,
you end up with a film
that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cup and vaccum cleaner .
this movie was very painful .
the pain
it caused
is about equal to the pain
caused
by having your genital carved out with a spoon ,
and then having the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid .
