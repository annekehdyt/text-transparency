an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track 
`` soul survivor '' is the latest entry in the `` who 's dead
and who 's alive '' genre of horror film .
two teenaged couple 
sean and cassie and matt and annabel 
prepare to go off to different college ,
but
before they part until thanksgiving break ,
they attend one last fling at a rave-type party in some burnt-out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel
( eliza dushku 
a.k.a .
faith 
the other vampire slayer ) .
motiveless creepy guy start paying far too much attention to cassie
( the generic melissa sagemiller )
for reason
that are never explained ,
and before long 
the quartet leave the party .
driving away in their suv ,
they are pursued
and then passed by the motiveless creepy guy ,
who promptly
and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway ,
causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river .
sean is killed
( or is he ?
) 
and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt
( she was driving )
when she is not being haunted by sean 's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guy .
much unexplained incoherence follows as cassie 's mental state degenerate further ,
until we reach the predictable conclusion .
so ,
who is dead
and who is alive ?
after ninety minute of this purgatory ,
who actually cares ?
