i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie .
i am still not sure
if i regret it or not .
i felt
like i was watching the film
made by that group of film school student
that did not quite make the cut .
it plays up every hollywood clich\u00e9 imaginable ,
all the while flogging us with the 'corporation are the ultimate evil ' message .
subtlety this movie does not know .
as far as that goes ,
it even manages to provide
it is own spoilers.the story appears to be a computer nerd 's fantasy world come true .
the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend ,
yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker
( i think ) ,
among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true element
that you will have to see for yourself.as well ,
i should have known
it would be a z-movie
when i saw ned bellamy ...
he tends to be a good tip-off.can not recommend this one ,
i am afraid .
