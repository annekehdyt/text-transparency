to be honest ,
i did not like that much this movie
when i saw it for the first time .
but i guess
the trouble is that i have not seen it in a theater .
big mistake !
because the # 1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the setting
and # 2 is the cinematography .
try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system .
the music is good
and puts the movie to a higher level
( and a commercial potential ) .
the more i see it ,
the more i like it.it is definitely one of renny harlin 's best movie .
this guy knows about action .
die hard 2 
the long kiss good bye 
etc .
and it is particularly good in this movie .
the special effect are great and spectacular .
stallone really needed
that movie get back with success .
still good to see him !
