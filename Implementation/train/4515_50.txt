as hard
as it is for me to believe ,
with all of the awful reality show out there over the past few year ,
this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet .
i am still wondering
if this was actually just a spoof done by the sctv gang .
if andy kaufmann were still alive
i would be sure
he was behind this .
can a rock band stoop any lower
than has inxs to do such a shameful thing as this ?
the premise is simple and moronic .
audition a bunch of karaoke reject to become the new lead singer of inxs ,
to take the place of michael hutchence
( who committed suicide in 1997 ) .
eight year
and no hit later ,
the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabe
to be the new lead singer of a band
that is 20 year past its prime .
so they trot all of these awful singer
( i thought
american idol had its share of doozy )
who do atrocious rendition of just about every classic ( and predictable )
rock song imaginable .
and then they cut to the inxs band member
who are seriously discussing the merit of each of these candidate .
you could see better
( and more original )
rock performer at just about any night club in any city in the world.it has all the usual uncreative element of every other reality show .
lame reality participant 
lame interview 
lame host/emcee 
lame `` judging '' of performance 
and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show .
can these show get any more predictable ?
it is clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band ;
a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom
before they are finally buried into oblivion .
michael hutchence ,
if he had any shred of dignity
when alive 
has to be rolling over in his grave .
not that inxs were ever a great band ,
but i had no idea
they were this pathetic .
if inxs are at all representative of what rock and roll has become ,
this show would be the final proof
that rock and roll is once and for all 
dead .
