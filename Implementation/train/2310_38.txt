no 
this is not no alice fairy tale my friend !
this `wonderland ' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody wonderland murder
that occurred back in 80 's california .
at the center of this bloodbath was no other than `johnny wad ' himself .
yes 
john holme !
daddy ding-dong used other shotgun than his infamous 13-inch milk machine .
besides being a legendary adult film actor ,
holme was as also a hardcore drug addict
who befriended various hollywood junkie .
val kilmer was occasionally majestic as holme ,
but for once this holme character did not milk it through completely .
the film possesses a `who 's who ' of supporting player :
josh lucas and dylan mcdermott as hollywood riffraff 
kate bosworth and lisa kudrow as the woman in holme life 
and eric bogosian as a menacing tinsletown entrepreneur .
these character do play integral part 
directly or indirectly 
in the `wonderland ' murder .
out of this support group 
it was josh lucas
who was the most fierce and impressive as the ardent ron launius .
lucas is gradually escalating into a major hollywood player with such charismatic turn in `a beautiful mind ' and `sweet home alabama ' .
director jame cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker
by displaying a vast amount of overextended scene 
just like holme ' famous organ .
holme was eventually acquitted of the `wonderland ' murder .
he died of complication from the aid virus .
`wonderland ' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night ,
and if holme really laid out his weapon .
oop !
wrong holme movie !
ok !
that is enough
before i get `penislized ' i mean penalized .
bye holmy !
