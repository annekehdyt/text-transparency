rea 
sutherland 
demunn 
and von sydow
( in a small role )
are all illiant in their performance .
sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role ,
where he must portray a character whose morality is 
at first 
uncertain to the audience .
as is so often the case with sutherland 's character ,
we must ask `` is he a villian [ in this case 
a minor one ] 
or a hero ?
`` this is a disturbing story ,
intelligently told 
about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union
that impeded the effort of extremely competent person .
as sutherland 's character wryly note ,
`` the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability
not to make special exception '' .
the `` committee meeting ''
( between rea and sutherland 's character )
after perestroika is enforced ,
with its revelation 
has enormous emotional impact .
you can feel the suffering of the dedicated person
who labored in that system.the handful of dramatic scene portraying victim ' family member adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story .
this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter ,
but effectively reminds us
that the victim had life ,
and were loved.this is a sad ,
but very important film ,
which deserved its showcase on canada 's history television .
