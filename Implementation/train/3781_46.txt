not a bad word
to say about this film really .
i was not initially impressed by it
but it grew on me quickly .
i like it a lot and i think
its a shame
that many person can not see past the fact
that it was banned in some territory ,
mine being one of them .
the film deliver in the shock 
gore and atmosphere department .
the score is a beautiful piece of suspense
delivering apparatus .
it only seems fair
that chris young went on to be one of the best composer in the business .
the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard 
if a little wooden in some spot ,
and the effect are very real and gritty .
all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book .
i have noted in some review
that the film has gotten serious flack
having the famous killer 's p.o.v shot .
and i ask :
what is wrong with that ? ? ?
it is a classic shot
that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre
and is a great
to keep the killer 's identity a secret .
the only thing
that stops this film
getting top mark in my book
is that the surprise twist
( killer revealed )
is not handled with more care ,
i mean it just happens kind of quickly ,
though the great performance make it just about credible .
aside from that prank is a great movie
( though i prefer the original title )
and its a shame
that so many person knock it off
as just a cheap piece of crap .
its more than that 
but only few know
that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher .
what a shame ... . its a really good movie person !
believe me !
