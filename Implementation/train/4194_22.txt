a dog
found in a local kennel
is mated with satan
and has a litter of puppy ,
one of which is given to a family
who has just lost their previous dog to a hit and run .
the puppy wants no time
in making like donald trump
and firing the mexican housekeeper 
how festive .
only the father suspects
that this canine is more then he appears ,
the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch .
so it is up to dad
to say
the day.this late 70 's made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia .
when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail-biter ,
but revisiting it as an adult i now realize
that it is merely lame 
boring ,
and not really well-acted in the least bit.my grade :
d
