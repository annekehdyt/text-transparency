this is probably one of the worst movie ever made .
bad acting 
bad special effect 
bad plot ,
bad everything .
in the last 15 minute a cat suited-cyborg is introduced
which muddles everything .
malcom macdowell must have needed
to make a house payment
because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd
to pay the bill .
i just don '' t know
how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap
and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning .
i could have done better special effect in my bathtub .
there is no continuity .
the editor must have been asleep or on drug its so bad .
acting .
do they have to smoke to be bad . ?
the gun
either shoots blue flame or bullet ,
make up your mind .
the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike
that it is confusing .
whay is it called 2013 seadly wake .
it has nothing to do with the movie
