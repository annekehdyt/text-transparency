one does not get to enjoy this gem 
the 1936 invisible ray 
often .
but no can forget it .
the story is elegant .
karloff 
austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat 
is janos rukh 
genius science
who reads ancient beam of light to ascertain event in the great geological past particularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa .
joining him is the ever-elegant lugosi
( as a rare hero ) ,
who study `` astro-chemistry . ''
france drake is the lovely 
underused young wife ;
frank lawton the romantic temptation ;
and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh ,
in a performance worthy of marium ospenskya.the story move swiftly in bold episode 
with special effect
that are still handsome .
it also contains some wonderful line .
one rukh restores his mother 's sight ,
he asks ,
`` mother 
can you see ,
can you see ? ''
`` yes 
i can see more clearly than ever .
and what i see frighten me . ''
even better when mother rukh says ,
`` he oke the first law of science . ''
i am not alone among my acquaintance
in having puzzled for many many year
exactly what this first law of science is.this movie is definitely desert island material .
