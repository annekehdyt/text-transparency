saw this as previous viewer by accident ,
i have watched it twice now .
i thoroughly enjoyed it ,
no silly thought
provoking message just plain good fun entertainment 
good song 
good character and a just a feel good film
highly recommended to those of us
that just like to enjoy film
and not dissect them great fun for all the family here .
i did not realise rosie alvarez is played by vanessa william ,
she is excellent and very sultry .
the song like one boy and one last kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your foot to jason alexander is the complete contrast to his character in pretty woman ans is very good .
tyne daley still sticks in my mind from cagney and lacey and her voice and accent
still had that rememance in it .
overall i just loved it
and will be looking to purchase it
if it is available
