this is a really bad film ,
with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though ! .
all the character are just annoying
( except lamas ) ,
and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for ! ,
plus the action is very boring .
the film gives us 3 villain
who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing
when in fact there boring 
laughable and just a bunch of moron
that i wanted to shut up ! ,
plus
it looks very cheap and amateurish ! .
lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma
but he can not save this piece of crap ,
and believe
it or not the opening was really cool ,
as was the ending ,
however the middle is incredibly boring ,
and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button ! ,
plus the dialog is especially laughable ! .there is a cool bar scene
that i really liked ,
but once lamas head to the dock
it all falls apart ,
plus the scene
where the villain torture jennifer 's family ,
and kill them were supposed to find it disturbing
when it in fact is laughable ! .
this is a really bad film ,
with bad acting and a very boring pace ,
lorenzo lamas is really cool though ! ,
however it is not enough ,
not recommended .
the direction is very bad .
george erschbamer does a very bad job here 
with mediocre camera work 
bland location ,
and keeping the film at a boring pace .
the acting is pretty bad
( except for lamas ) .
lorenzo lamas is awesome here ,
and
while he is not required to act ,
he is quite fun to watch ,
and has a really cool character ,
and had a lot of charisma ,
however even he can not save this one ,
and he had no chemistry with the cast either !
( lamas rule ! ) .
josie bell is terrible here ,
and
while she is decent looking ,
she is not very convincing
and had no chemistry with lamas .
cheryl jean is hot ,
but does not have much to do but scream and scared ,
she did okay at that.robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain ,
and was not menacing at all ,
he was laughable
as were the other 2. rest of the cast are bad .
overall avoid !
avoid ! ,
even if you do like lamas
( like me ) .
