one of the many merrie melody cartoon
that entertained american moviegoer during wwii 
bob clampett 's `` an itch in time '' portrays a hobo flea settling on elmer fudd 's dog .
the little guy turns into a real sadist
while making a home on the dog 's back ,
but elmer warns the dog :
`` one more scwatch and i will give you a bath ! ''
meanwhile 
the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog !
* and that is not the end !
i noticed
that in one scene 
elmer is reading a comic book featuring bug bunny and porky pig .
obviously 
elmer and bug frequently co-starred
but elmer never co-starred with porky
( unless you count the very short `` any bond today ? `` ) .
but to me 
the thought of elmer reading about these other famous character from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world ,
as though he knew of their existence within his universe
even though they do not appear in this cartoon.of course ,
i am probably going too far in my analysis .
i am sure
that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment ,
and it certainly entertains .
as for the `` i might get to like this '' line ,
it sounds as though that was something
that the censor would not have allowed
but somehow missed ;
i 
for one 
do not actually know
what it was supposed to sound like .
was it something sexual ?
as for the end 
had i thought
that i would seen everything ,
i would have been tempted to look for more ,
rather than do what the cat did
( although it was a neat trick ) .
*the guy behind these cartoon
sure had a thing for tnt ,
did not they ?
