this is the final episode we deserved .
at the end of the last season 
thing were left in a 'life goes on ' mood ,
which was hardly the wrap-up
that this realistic series deserved .
while not a happy show ,
this series was always one
that made you think
( a rare thing on television ) ,
and this is no exception .
'is death justified by reasoning ? '
'are moral reflective of society 
or is society shaped by the moral
that are selected by the few in power ? '
'what is a just death ,
and can it exist ? '
all of these question 
and more 
are posed by the writer of this show every week ,
and this is their final thesis .
fine acting 
great writing 
wonderful camera-work 
illiant editing 
clean direction .
if you have seen the series and you missed this
when it first ran ,
then get a hold on a copy somehow .
if you never watched the series
when it ran ,
then this will stand up on its own ,
but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the character
are and what they are alluding to in their varied past .
for those of us
who were avid viewer of the series in the last two season ,
this is very satisfying viewing .
