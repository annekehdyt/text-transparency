i watched the dvd
( called black widow in the u.s.a. )
and felt afterward
that it was 
indeed 
a truly awful movie .
but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film 
or i missed a lot .
the sex scene had very little vulgarity and no nudity
( not even a east ) ,
but i have read several other comment on imdb.com
mentioning the vulgarity
and something about a tampon .
i did not see anything like that 
just a bad 
boring film with unlikable character and a trite 
sophomoric plot .
giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gill ,
and nary an expression touches her face .
and her name makes me think of super-sizing a beverage at taco bell :
`` i will have the cola grande ! ''
it was actually kind of fun
it was so bad ,
i got to play like i
was in my own mystery science theater 3000 ,
noting thing like the fact
that dafoe 's skin is too big for his face .
it is really like silly putty !
