kudos to the patience of paul muni ,
who spent hour and hour in the makeup room each day
to look the part of zola .
muni was the one of the biggest star in the 1930s and i wonder
how many person today -other than classic movie buffs -
know anything about it .
he was a giant in the business for at least a decade .
he could have won the academy award for this performance ,
which would have given him two in a row ,
as he won it for playing louis pasteur the year before .
my own opinion is that
while he tended to overact a bit ,
i still think
he was one of the great actor of the `` golden age . ''
whatever part he played ;
you were riveted to the screen
watching him.unlike the pasteur role ,
i thought this story smacked of a little too much
of what we have seen in the last 60 year :
going overboard to make a liberal hero .
even in 1937 
hollywood could not suppress its disdain for police or for the military ,
here making it a point
to tell us how `` corrupt '' those organization are .
filmmaker just love it
when authority is challenged and defeated .
in that regard 
this film is way ahead of its day
since we have seen this big-time since the 1960s.however ,
it must be noted the fact support this story .
it also does not in any way diminish zola 's accomplishment as a social reformer ,
getting rid of certain evil .
good for him !
i wish
they had spent more time
showing that ,
than concentrating on one trial .
