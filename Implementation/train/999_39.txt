if anybody really wants to understand hitler ,
read wwi history not wwii history .
find out what happened during that war 
how soldier had to live around dead corpse all the time .
how so many soldier went insane ,
from what they saw during wwi ,
at the time
they called it `` shellshocked '' now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder .
if you learn the true horror of wwi ,
you will begin to understand hitler .
you will understand
how a human being can become desensitized to death ,
not because their evil but simply
because it was the only way for them too cope with the horror around them.this movie unfortunately misses
that ,
as so many other do .
read some book on the subject
and you should watch the movie `` path of glory '' ,
the only good wwi movie ever made .
you will see the frustration of the soldier in that movie 
the sense of helplessness 
and a utter devaluation of human life ,
as nothing more than bullet catchers.thats what this movie misses ,
its really the key point to understanding germany .
a lost war ,
where million and million of german lost their life ,
for no real reason .
then comes an utter economic collapse ,
following the war .
those are the factor
that create extremism.the loss of family member and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism .
unfortunately this movie ignored these factor ,
and has just become another throw away piece of crap
to throw on the pile .
with really no real value 
there are fictional movie 's based upon fictional character
that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does .
they just threw hitler name on this so
it would sell more .
