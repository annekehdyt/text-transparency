every so often a movie comes along
that knocks me down a notch and reminds me
that my taste in film i seek out to watch is not always impeccable .
i normally would stay away from stuff like this ,
but i was duped by some glowing review
and the rohmer pedigree.there is an initial and intriguing novelty to the production
where rohmer essentially superimposes the actor onto painted
( digital )
back-drops of revolution era france .
this quickly wane
and becomes about as interesting
as watching the paint dry on a paint by number scene .
what we are left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrat in 18th century france .
none of the character are appealing or sympathetic .
the pace is so languid 
the dialogue so arduous ,
and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer ,
that i ended up not caring
whose head rolled ,
who was harboring who ,
or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about .
the movie would 've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score
( there is some fine classical music
used at the very end ) .
despite being so `` talky '' ,
the film plays much like a silent film 
and the worst kind of film at that 
a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subject .
only the most astute french historian will find anything to take from this film ,
as it dose seem to paint well known event from a new angle
( the lady is english and a royalist ) .
otherwise 
avoid this yawner at all cost
unless you are suffering from insomnia
( i dozed off twice ) .
