sammy horn
( michael de barre )
is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in california .
he has a lovely wife 
grace horn
( rosanna arquette ) ,
who is pregnant ,
and a beautiful son of about five year old .
sammy indeed loves his family 
but like dr. jeckyll and mr. hyde ,
he has a double life ,
having sex with many different woman .
dr. jane bordeaux
( nastassja kinski )
is trying to help him .
ok 
it is my fault :
i read the summary of the other imdb user comment ,
i saw the imdb user rating ,
but i really did not believe
that rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski could participate in such a bad movie .
i decided to check it ,
and actually some comment are very complacent .
the storyline 
the screenplay and the dialog are so silly and laughable
that even in some x-rated movie we can find more intelligent story .
the photography is so amateurish and naive
that in some part it seems to be taken through a vhs camcorder .
michael de barre does not have sense of ridiculous :
being an old man 
bald ,
would be acceptable in an advertisement of viagra or grandfather of the small boy .
but as an attractive man
who gets
and has sex with any woman ,
it is scary .
in wood allen 's comedy 
maybe he got a chance ,
but in a `serious ' movie 
it is funny .
i am trying to figure out why or how rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski accepted to participate in such awful 
amateurish and trash movie .
do they need money ?
lack of chance in better movie due to their age ?
are they friend of the `director '
( sorry for using this word )
and decided to help and promote him ?
i do not know
whether the intention of rosanna arquette was to show her east full of silicone ,
but it is unacceptable
that such a great actress accept such a script .
the same is applicable to the gorgeous nastassja kinki .
she is presented fat ,
without make-up ,
without any glamour .
a total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history .
a fact is really intriguing me :
how can a reader ,
without any personal interest ,
promote this trash ,
giving higher rating or writing favorable comment about this movie ?
are they friend of the `director '
( again ,
i am using this word ... )
or the cast ?
it sounds very strange to me
that a normal imdb reader can like such a film .
my vote is two.title
( brazil ) :
`viciado em sexo '
( `addicted in sex ' )
