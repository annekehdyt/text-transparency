i would really ,
really wanted to see this movie ,
and waited for month to get it through our blockbuster total access account .
when it showed up in our mailbox ,
i threw it straight into the dvd player.i
was very sadly disappointed ,
which in turn made me mad .
i will give any movie a chance ,
even if i want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop ' .
i watched it all the way through ,
but did not get anything from it
but frustration.the acting was very 
very good ,
but that was about it .
nothing is explained ;
while we understand
that mathieu become depressed and land in a psych ward of some kind ,
we are never given insight to his 'downfall ' .
while we understand
that he and cedric eak up 
again 
we do not see it happen
or why it happened .
during an interview with mathieu 's doctor 
cedric reveal
that he had cheated on him once ,
but it was no big deal .
i expected to see this in flashback 
but no
-- nothing .
we also gets the hint
that cedric was the one to ing mat to the hospital
-- but again 
we do not see it.i know
some movie are a 'take it
as it is ' basis ,
but this movie honestly ticked me off .
when pierre 
cedric 's ex shows up in the club
and starts trouble ,
we do not see hide nor hair of him until near the end ,
and it took me a good chunk of time
to figure out
that pierre was the ex .
his personality at the club
and when mat finds him are entirely different .
i might even be wrong saying this ,
it was that confusing.the film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed 
out-of-place and confusing pace .
i can keep up with film like 'pi ' 
'citizen kane ' and other film
that have flashback/flash-forwards left and right ,
but cu did not capture
and hold onto the style .
at the end of 'citizen kane ' 
you know
what is going on and discover the answer to the main mystery .
cu just leaves you hanging .
it has an air of pretension in its 'we are not gon na tell you a damned thing ,
figure it out for yourself ' presentation .
it is like reading a book with the chapter switched around and page missing.good acting ,
like i said .
i liked the character ,
but the whole story was just too disappointing .
