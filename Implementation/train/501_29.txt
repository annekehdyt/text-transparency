this is a really strange film
-- and that is not a bad thing .
it is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale .
i am sure
that some may find this movie a bit too strange ,
but i loved it .
once again 
this director ings together a wonderful cast of everyday person
( not actor )
and gets a great ensemble-type performance .
although not nearly as sad as umberto d ,
both movie have a very similar point to make
-- this one just does it in a very absurdist way .
ignore the cheesy special effect
-- after all 
it was made in the early 1950s and special effect are not terribly important anyway
( or at least they should not be in film ) .
instead 
just sit back
and enjoy the very strange and silly ride .
unless you are a total curmudgeon ,
you will have a ball.by the way ,
since i first reviewed this film ,
i have seen another desica directed film
that is an absolute must-see
and that is the child
are watching us .
while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan 
a great film nevertheless .
