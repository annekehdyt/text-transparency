two film are useful for scaring person to god 
this and 'event horizon ' .
one has a significan not and poignant message ,
the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get .
too bad paul anderson went on to the accursed resident evil movie ,
he really had something
going.thief in the night is hampered by many obvious independent film attribute
( acting 
storytelling 
dialog 
and persuasion )
and it is obvious what the film 's intention are from the start .
the christian film industry has not learned from the failure of this ,
so we are stuck with the omega code 
left behind 
and the other tribulation movie .
their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message :
`` get saved 
folk ! ''
that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible.overall ,
i can not believe
i am even writing this much about a movie this ineffective .
skip it entirely and go back to sam neil gouging out his eyeball .
1 out of 5 .
