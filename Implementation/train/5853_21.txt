i would like to comment the series as a great effort .
the story line
although requiring a few improvement
was pretty well ,
especially in season 1. season 2 however became more of a freak show ,
and lost da 's original charm .
season one story line was more interesting 
a light side to the life at jam pony
while a focused serious plot with manticore
chasing down the x-series .
i was looking forward to new season ,
in fact i still am .
i hope
the fox guy and da production crew realize
that a lot of ppl still wait for da
to make a comeback .
even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled ,
da can make it big
if worked on properly ,
and i think
a name like jame cameron should take on this challenge .
