this was a nice attempt at something
but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above
it is low budget trapping .
the use of virtual set almost work but at some point it fails miserably .
they made good use of the small budget i guess .
i just wish the story
and most of the acting was better .
there are a lot of part where
you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if
they actually hit those mark
but they do not .
confusing and unbelievable story .
bad dvd transfer too .
it does not take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting .
this i had to shut off .
it was too boring .
i can do slow movie .
but just make them appealing in some aspect .
visually 
story-wise 
acting 
etc .
this was lacking in all department
so it never added up to an engrossing experience .
maybe the film maker 's next attempt will be better .
