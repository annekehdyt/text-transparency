the short
that starts this film
is the true footage of a guy
named gary ,
apparently
it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station
where gary works in the town of beaver .
gary is a little `` different '' ;
he is an impersonator
and drives an old chevy named farrah
( after fawcett ) .
lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from gary some time
later inviting him to return to beaver
to get some footage of the local talent contest
he has put together ,
including gary 's staggering performace as olivia newton dawn .
oh 
my .
the two short
that follow are gary 's story ,
the same one
you just witnessed
only the first is portrayed by sean penn and the second by crispin glover
titled `` the orkly kid . ''
if you are in the mood
for making fun
of someone this is definitely the film to watch .
i was doubled over with laughter through most of it 
especially crispins performance
which could definitely stand on it is own .
when it was over ,
i had to rewind the film
to once again watch the real gary and all his shining idiocy .
although olivia was the focus ,
i would have liked to have seen one of the `` fictitious '' short take a jab at gary 's barry manilow impersonation ,
whic h was equally ridiculous .
