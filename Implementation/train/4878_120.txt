armageddon ppvthe last ppv of 2006smackdown and.match result ahead********we are starting the show with the inferno match .
kane v. mvp .
this was an okay match .
nothing about wrestling here .
this was about the visual .
overall 
this was not bad .
there were a few close spot here
with kane getting too close to the fire ,
but in the end 
kane won with ramming mvp into the fire back first.nice opener .
let 's continue.teddy long announces a new match for the tag team title :
london and kendrick will defend against :
regal and taylor 
the hardyz 
and mnm in a ladder match ! ! ! !
let 's get moving ! match two :
fatal four way ladder match .
this was total carnage .
judging by three out of the four team here ,
you would expect chaos .
the spot were amazing .
a total spot-fest .
one point jeff went for poetry in motion
and london moved
and jeff hit the ladder !
shortly afterword 
jeff is set on the top rope with two ladder nearby
as mnm were going to kill jeff ,
matt makes the save and jeff hits the `` see-saw '' shot to joey mercury !
mercury is hurt .
his eye is shut quickly
and is busted open hard way .
mercury is taken out of the match
and nitro is still there .
he is going to fight alone for the title !
regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face-first into the ladder !
jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot ,
dropkicks through the ladder to nail jeff !
awesome !
in the end 
london and kendrick retain the tag team title .
what a match ! !
! this was insane .
i can not figure out why wwe did not announce this till now .
the buyrate would increase huge .
i am sure
the replay value will be good though.mercury has suffered a shattered nose and laceration to the eye .
he is at the hospital now .
get well kid.no way anything else here will top that.next up :
the miz v .
boogeyman .
( ugh )
this was a nothing match .
will the boogeyman ever wrestle ?
the miz sucks too .
after a insane crowd 
this kills them dead .
dud.chris benoit v. chavo .
this was a strong match .
i enjoyed it .
chavo hit a killer superplex at one point !
benoit hit eight german suplex too !
benoit wins with the sharpshooter .
good stuff.helm v. yang-cruiserweight title championship match .
this was a good match .
unfortunately 
the stupid fan did not care for this .
why ?
helm and yang are very talented and wrestled well .
i agree with jbl .
he ranted to the crowd .
jbl is 100 % correct .
learn to appreciate this or get out .
mr. kennedy v. the undertaker-last ride match .
not too much here .
this was a slug fest 
with a few exception .
kennedy at one point tossed taker off the top of the stage to the floor .
the spot was fine .
reaction was disappointing .
the end spot was taker tomb-stoned kennedy on the hearse
and won the match .
unreal .
kennedy needed this win .
they both worker hard .
still 
kennedy needed this win .
undertaker should have lost .
creative screwed up again.a stupid diva thing is next .
i like woman .
not this .
at least torrie was not here .
that is refreshing .
judging from the crowd 
layla should have won .
the wwe wanted ashley .
consider this your bathroom eak .
next.main event :
cena and batista v. finlay and booker t. this was also a nothing match .
the focus was cena v. finlay and batista v. booker .
batista and booker can not work well together .
finlay tries to make cena look good .
the finish was botched .
finlay hit batista 's knee with a chair shot and batista no-sold the shot
and finished the match .
lame .
not main event caliber at all.overall 
armageddon would have scored less ,
but the ladder match was the main event here .
that was enough money 's worth right there .
a few other were solid .
the last word :
a good ppv with the ladder match being the savior .
smackdown is not a bad show
just is not compelling enough .
smackdown need to stop letting cena tag along .
let smackdown stand on their own two leg .
this show proves
that smackdown can .
