fatty drives the bus is simply the funniest 
most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing.this movie is by no means up to hollywood standard 
or even that of a straight-to-video movie fluff comedy starring terry `` hulk '' hogan 
in term of camera work 
editing 
acting 
budget 
or anything else.what this movie does have though ,
is a very original and enjoyable story ,
and it is obviously done by person
who love making it ,
and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really eak through all its budget and acting downfalls.this movie proves
that you do not need a huge budget or decent actor to make a great film ,
all you need are some original idea and some passion for what your doing.simply the best movie ever .
i do not care how you get it ,
rent it ,
order it ,
steal it ,
download it ,
just see this movie.now i just hope
they make a dvd version .
