i saw `` an american in pari '' on its first release
when i was still at school
and fell in love with it straightaway .
i went back
to see it again the next day
and have lost count of the number of time i have seen it since 
both in the cinema and on tv .
it makes fantastic use of some of the best music
and song by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century
( george gershwin )
and features the greatest male
( gene kelly )
and female
( leslie caron )
dancer in hollywood history .
the supporting cast of oscar levant
( as quirky as ever ) ,
georges guetary
( why did not he make more movie ? )
and nina foch
( illiant in an unsympathetic role )
are at the top of their form .
the closing ballet 
superbly choreographed to the title music ,
makes excellent use of the sight and sound of pari and of the image of impressionist and post-impressionist artist .
all the gershwin song are beautifully staged ,
but the most memorable are `` it is very clear ''
( caron and kelly on the bank of the seine )
and `` i got rhythm ''
( the kid of pari joining gene kelly in `` une chanson americaine '' ) .
if you love pari ,
see this movie .
if you have never been to pari in your life ,
see it .
but see it !
