i had the distinct displeasure
of seeing this movie at the 2006 vancouver international film festival .
i have been attending this festival for over 5 year ,
and i have certainly seen some poor movie on occasion .
however 
'first bite ' has reached a and new low in film .
in spite of being shot in beautiful location 
with the occasional 
exquisite close up of fabulous food 
the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twist and stilted character
until i was practically begging for it to end.the lead actor 
david la haye ,
completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie 
portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end .
additional sub-plot 
such as eating disorder 
were developed so poorly
and completely did not fit within any context
that the movie had shown up to that point.a theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt
to conceal a movie
that achieves nothing 
goes nowhere 
and completely disappoint .
