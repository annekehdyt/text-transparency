i agree
that capital city should be on dvd .
i watched this show only by accident in 1994
and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot .
it was nice to see american
who work aoad in london in the financial industry for a change .
i loved rolf in this role
and loved every other role
that he has been in .
i can not believe the show only lasted 13 episode .
i liked william armstrong as hudson 's flamboyant charming friend in the series .
when they aired this show in the new york city area ,
it was always late at night or at off time .
the show is less than an hour long .
i felt
this show should have gone on longer
but the casting change in the second season really made the show a little less interesting .
i did not care for sylvia
but missed the actress 
julia phillips-lane in the previous season .
i felt this show took chance
and often it worked .
it showed american who loved and chose to live in london .
the american character were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterpart .
i also liked the fact
that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british .
i liked watching julia ormond in an early role .
i felt
this show should have lasted longer .
i felt at time
that the preview lasted as long as the show in less than an hour .
they could have transferred the cast to new york city
and it would have been a hit in america .
