a wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash broadway play about the life of sadie and bessie delany 
two african-american sister
who both lived over the age of 100
and told their story
of witnessing a century of american history .
ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performance as bessie and sadie 
respectively .
amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth 
the white new york time reporter
whose article about the sister
launched the book 
etc .
many of the flashback scene and even many of the present-day one are very powerful ,
if not quite as inspirational as in the book .
that is the only real drawback ,
combined with the fact
that certain aspect of the story are not presented clearly 
such as the inter-racial background of the sister ' mother
and why their father was so stern .
but other than that 
a very well-done 
excellently performed 
powerful movie .
