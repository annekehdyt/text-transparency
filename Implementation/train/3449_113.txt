follows the usual formula
in putting a new recruit
-- this time the first african-american
( cuba gooding )
after president truman desegregates the armed force --
through the u. s. navy 's deep-sea diver training program
that is run by a racist zealot
( robert deniro ) .
if the program were not bad enough ,
it is got to be located in bayonne ,
new jersey.there is nothing wrong with the performance .
robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively .
cuba gooding ,
raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south ,
is the expectable paragon of rectitude .
the girl
-- one could hardly call them woman --
are charleze theron and lonette mckee .
they have minor role
and are mostly there to argue
that their man should exercise common sense .
other decent performer
-- power boothe and hal holook --
have even more perfunctory role.that is about it .
almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer .
a ship is called a boat .
robert de niro salute indoor 
uncovered .
after a utal assault on hospital personnel 
he is transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted .
somebody shouts `` i am outta here '' in the early 1950s .
( maybe it was a common expression at the time .
if so 
`` my bad . '' )
person address each other by rank
-- `` lieutenant '' 
`` boatswain 's mate 
'' `` commander 
''
as they do in the army ,
wherea in the navy they are simple `` mister ''
( if an officer )
or addressed by their last name
( if enlisted ) .
i did not bother to check
if there was a rank
called `` senior master chief ''
in 1950.cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe .
everyone in the navy ,
it seems ,
hates negro except for one guy from wisconsin .
he stutter
and is held in contempt by the other in his class .
it is like the scene in `` animal house '' ,
in which the applican not to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh 
a black man ,
and a blind kid.gooding is an enlisted man 
a second class petty officer .
he manages to marry a beautiful woman
who has just graduated from medical school .
in one of their argumants she pleads with him .
she just wants to be a doctor
and he should join her 
quit the navy 
and lead a quiet life .
`` and just let life pass you by ?
`` 
he retorts .
yes .
yes 
just be a doctor 's spouse
and let life pass you by .
you can wave to it from the golf course in boca raton.these kind of flick were common enough in world war ii .
`` bombardier 
'' `` airial gunner 
''
that sort of thing .
cheap
as they often were ,
they had some educational feature .
you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner .
here 
the technical detail are skipped over ,
perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them
( except boyle 's law ,
which we learned in high-school chemistry )
.i could not follow what was happening during some of the emergency
without which a movie like this would not exist .
if i got the mechanical problem right ,
it was because i guessed correctly .
the direction is no help either .
the movie abounds in close up 
so many
that they lose any dramatic impact
they might have had .
and the emergency are confusing
because they are ill focused.why go on ?
want to see a better example of this kind of movie ?
almost any will do
-- except maybe `` g. i. jane '' ,
in which the abused hero is a heroin .
try the training camp scene in `` the young lion . ''
there the victim is a jew .
or try `` from here to eternity 
''
in which no easy sympathy button are pushed
and the victim is a grown man
who refuses to bend
and who is active in inging the conflict on 
just like `` cool hand luke . ''
no easy excuse are offered ,
because easy excuse are too easy.thoroughly formulaic ,
and not well done .
