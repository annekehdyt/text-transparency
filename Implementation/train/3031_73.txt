not having seen the film in the original theater release ,
i was happily surprised
when the dvd arrived ,
since this film did not have the wide distribution
it merited.denzel washington directorial debut
and the finished product have nothing to envy other film about the same theme by more accomplished director .
the film has a very professional look .
it shows
that mr. washington has learned a lot
being on the other side of the camera .
he ings a different angle to this film.one of the best thing
the film has is ,
without a doubt 
the fine performance by derek luke .
he is an actor
who 
with the right guidance ,
will go far 
no doubt .
his take on the troubled young man ,
at this point of his life 
in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life ,
up to now ,
has dealt him ,
is very true .
his antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain
who is basically very good
and has so much
to give ,
but no one seems to see
that side of his character.at the worst time of his despair 
antwone is sent to dr. davenport ,
played by mr. washington 
in a very sober 
if somehow subdued manner .
because of the angst within antwone ,
he misses the opportunity
of opening himself to this man ,
who wants to help ,
but because of the constrain placed on his office ,
just have three session
and then has to dismiss his patient.thing work out ,
as antwone is able to convince the doctor
to keep on working with him .
antwone 's past is revealed in detail .
the abuse he suffers at the hand of mrs. tate 
his foster mother 
is utal ,
to say the least .
the attempt at the hand of an older woman in the tate 's household of a sexual molestation 
gives antwone a bitter taste
that stays with him throughout his adult life ,
as he has been scarred by the shame
he carries with him.antwone find love at last with cheryl ,
who is patient enough
to make him see a different world by the love
she and support
she gives him.the lead performance are very good indeed .
denzel washington 's dr. davenport has his own problem too .
he is not a happy camper either .
he can help antwone ,
but he can not help himself 
or his relationship with an adoring wife .
the talent in the film is incredible .
joy bryant makes a fine cheryl .
novella nelson ,
who is a fine actress
is superb as mrs. tate ,
the abusing foster mother.the reunion of antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental 
but of course ,
if one is to believe
that fisher find happiness at last ,
one has to accept that part of the film as well .
