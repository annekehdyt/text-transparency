here is a review
for person like me .
this movie sucks from beginning to end .
i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted
to entertaining myself a la msf2000 .
the plot hinges on chance happening and rely on stupidity from person
who are supposed to be smart .
the lead falls for a con man and it does not occur to her that she might get conned ? ? ? ? ?
and she is rich ? ? ? ?
and she is a famous psychologist ? ? ? ? ?
come on 
person .
she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment
when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her ? ? ?
that was so staged
that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewer .
rain man would have been insulted .
i also admit
that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion
that some person have for meat-eater 
war-starter 
and fur-wearer .
my hatred is so complete
that it defies logic .
but i will give it a shot .
that it is not supposed to sound real is fine .
i do not care .
it is that everyone talks the same .
mamet can not create character ;
all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actor .
no wonder his actor are so wooden .
they are confused about everyone being the same character .
( however 
his later film do improve . )
