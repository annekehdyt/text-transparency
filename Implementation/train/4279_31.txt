i could not agree more with nomad 7 's and i a hvr 's comment .
a perfect laid back sunday morning movie .
the humor is subtle
( exact opposite of `` slapstick '' as one misguided commenter noted )
.but what always ceases to amaze me
is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over .
i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 year ago
when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend preview
( hbo maybe ? ) .
had never heard of it previously .
do not know why it was not marketed that well .
? ?
when dvd 's were released en mass ,
it was one of the first movie i replaced .
a great combination of cast and writing .
plus 
the back drop of montana wilderness does not hurt thing
either ( beautiful ) .it is probably not the type of comedy for everyone ,
but what is ?
if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley ,
this probably will not be your cup of tea .
this movie needs your full attention .
the humor is mostly in the dialog.i believe
my next viewing will probably be about my 12th .
but i still know
that
when it gets to the scene like the one
where the hood of the police car start blowing off ,
i am going to loose it
( ed o'neill 's face is priceless ! ) .
recommended 110 % .
