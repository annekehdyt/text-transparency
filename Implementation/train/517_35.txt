i had pleasure to watch the short film `` the cure '' 
by first time director ryan jafri .
what really impress me are the camera work
and music.i think
many young filmmaker
( as i myself am one of them )
would experience hard time with cinematography
when just start making of an indie .
we see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambition .
but this film ,
directorial debut from a young director ,
handled very well on screen .
the camera motion 
color 
lighting 
compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film.and music ,
as a key element of film language ,
helps a great deal too.it is hard to portray a woman 's heart 
her desire 
her fear 
especially in a short .
but still 
i have to admit i am not a fan of v/o
( narration ) ,
especially when the film is advanced by narration ,
instead of shot and cut .
my personal feeling to some of the narrative part is ,
my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard .
so the energy push audience back from the emotion of the film.overall ,
it is a short film nicely done ,
i could see the input from a director .
way to go 
ryan !
greeting from china ,
looking forward to your next.tim
