ok 
so i do not watch too many horror movie -
and the reason is film like 'dark remains ' .
i caught this on ( a surprisingly feature-filled )
dvd
and it scared me silly .
in fact the only extra i think
the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants.however ,
the next day i was telling someone about it
when i realised i would only really seen about 10 % of it .
the rest of the time i would been watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous
that my girlfriend would catch me
if i actually covered my eye .
the few time i did ave
watching the screen i
jumped so hard
that i decided not to look up again.the film-making
is solid
and the character ' situation was really compelling .
the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump-button -
it is merely a woodland 
a cabin and a disused jail - and a lot of darkness .
most surprising to me was the fact
that
while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production ,
the make-up effect really looked like
it was !
also 
it is obvious this is a film
made by someone with a great love of film-making .
the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system
like many hollywood movie have never done .
i noticed on-line
that this film won the la shriekfest
- a really major achievement ,
and i guess
that the festival had seen the filmmaker ' clear talent -
and probably a great deal more of this movie
than i managed to.turn up the sound ,
turn off the light 
and ,
if you want to keep your girlfriend -
order a pizza .
