yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition
that i transfered to dvd
and if anyone one wants to ing back the memory of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222 @ verizon.net.i searched everywhere
and i found nothing on this and i thought
that i can not be the only one on this planet
that has this classic on tape there
has to be other person
and if they do i fit in with them
being that very very few
that has this classic so i
consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppet christmas except one
that john denver did with the muppet again i thinks
its called a smokey mountain holiday im
not to sure but its close .
