as a wwii naval history buff 
and someone
who is not proud of this country 's history of race relation ,
i was looking forward to seeing this movie .
what a disappointing piece of schlock .
i made it about 3/4 of the way through ,
but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene .
the idea
that a u-boat would fire a torpedo at a dde ,
as if there was a hope
of hitting it ,
and then be able to `` run away '' from the dde while submerged 
is preposterous .
and that is just a small detail .
the whole movie was poorly written 
poorly directed 
and poorly acted .
i agree with other on this board
that this could have been a good movie .
it is as if they decided that ,
since all those crappy wwii propaganda film were made with all-white cast ,
they needed to make one with black person .
and as bad
as those old movie were ,
this is actually worse .
and it almost smack of false advertising to headline ossie davis and stephen rea .
it turns out
they had very minor role .
i have to believe
those two fine actor were embarrassed to be associated with this film .
i am done .
i have given way too much of my life this crap movie .
