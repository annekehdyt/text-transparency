i would not say
this is a bad movie ;
in fact it is pretty typical of the type of film
that the `` poverty row '' studio were releasing at the time .
filmed for monogram 
bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist 
masquerading as a respected member of the community .
in this movie 
bela and his henchman have the nasty habit of stealing young ide ,
and 
after their demise 
injecting bela 's wife with a serum taken from their body
in order to keep her young .
lugosi is more than up to the task
in making this an enjoyable film 
however 
the movie suffer from the ultra-wooden acting of co star luana walter and tristram coffin .
coffin
( nice name for a guy in a horror flick )
is especially bad in this case .
i have seen him in numerous movie and tv show
and he is always the same ; stiff 
wooden and utterly unconvincing .
miss walter is only slightly better ,
but she too lacks the acting talent
to make her role believable .
still 
the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme
only to be foiled in the end !
despite the poor
acting by some ,
`` the corpse vanish '' is an enjoyable movie for all to see .
