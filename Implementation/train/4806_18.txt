ok so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie
you ask ?
... well see this one
and maybe it will make more sense.. hitchcock never blended scene together better ... .the film weaf scene together flawlessly from the start
and yet you do not get
that scattered feeling
you sometimes get
when a movie runs you through the many character
it attempts to develop .
you sense
that the character will show you something unusual about themselves
and then
they do not disappoint you
when they do .
screenwriter/producer phil hay 's surreal tale of life 
blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes
you think
more about the 6 degree of separation in life than the movie by the same title ... i will be looking for more good thing from this producer in the future .
