never before has a film driven me to write a review
but this was just dire.i stuck with it
trying to find what it was about this film
that made snoop pick it as his first serious role
but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this
made a good book
but it certainly did not work for me
as a film.i found it unbelievable 
lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scene hideously stilted.a musical maestro
he may be but a serious actor snoop are not.the
acting by dylan mcdermott
and rose byrne was passable but not enough
to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue .
perhaps i have just entirely missed the point
but to me it did not fit into any genre ,
it did not elicit any empathy with the character
nor did it create any suspense ,
in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire
to slap all three of the main character !
