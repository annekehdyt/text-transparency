my left foot 
in my opinion 
is a great biopic about one of the world 's most talented author and painter .
the performance were smashing ,
the soundtrack was great ,
and the casting was perfect .
i thought
that christy
( daniel day-lewis )
was a very talented man ,
although i could not understand what he was saying most of the time .
in addition ,
when he threw a tantrum ,
i got a little scared .
also 
it is just so sad that he suffered from cereal palsy .
in conclusion ,
if you are a die-hard fan of daniel day-lewis or like biopic ,
i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world 's most talented author and painter .
you are in for a real treat and a good time ,
so do not miss this one .
