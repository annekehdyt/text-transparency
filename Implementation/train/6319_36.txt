this is the first tom hank movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater ,
although he is my favorite .
when i heard
he was going to play a hit-man ,
i was a little stunned thinking
`` can mr. hank pull this one off '' ?
and he did in high fashion .
this 1930 's depression era film is a about loyalty 
redemption 
and one path
that you do not want your child stumbling down .
tom hank leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan .
being the family man ,
and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman .
this movie tom hank rely more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue ,
which he delivers a knockout performance.on one night of one of his job 
michael 's son michael jr. ,
played by newcomer tyler hoechlin ,
witnesses the hit .
and michael sr. 's partner in crime 
fellow stage actor daniel craig can not have that information out .
so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr. ,
except michael jr. so the two head for chicago
to get conner rooney
( son of paul newman 's mr. rooney )
.the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys
to set thing right ,
even though son is along for the ride .
while on this deadly journey ,
someone has hired a hit for michael sr. the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire ,
played by a stain-teethed jude law.the movie
will have you feeling the old day .
and with thomas newman 's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it ,
you can not help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mende .
so sit back ,
and enjoy the wild ride .
