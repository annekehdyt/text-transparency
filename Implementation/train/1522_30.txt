this movie is amazing for several reason .
harris takes an extremely awkward documentary
and turns it into a relevant social commentary .
groovin ' gary is a small-town kid
who is ( assumed )
well-liked for his many impersonation .
when he decides to play olivia newton john in a local talent show
( for whom he is very passionate ) ,
gary 's action show
that he is at odd with the conservative social environment
in which he lives .
this result in him making various justification for his action so
that person will not think
that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast .
in the second installment 
harris exploites the struggle between gary and beaver in a novice attempt
to make a narrative out of the original documentary .
the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for harris ' extreme sensitivity with the subject .
unlike the second installment 
`` the orkly kid '' show gary as a truly troubled character .
he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail .
his secret passion for dressing like olivia newton john distances him even further from the person
that already consider him a social outcast .
the movie is depicted so realistically
that 
like reality 
it lends itself to many reaction .
surely 
one can see gary as a ridiculously pathetic character ,
but may also identify with him as an outcast .
