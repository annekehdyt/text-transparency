after coming off the first one
you think
the wayan other could come up with some new joke .
though i guess not .
if the first one was not bad enough this one is just so bad
it hurts to watch .
with all the actor they had in this film you think
they could come up with something a little more clever .
though they could not ,
they had to take all the same raunchy 
not funny joke from the first one and somehow put it into this film
thinking person would laugh at it again .
though the thing is i did not laugh at it the first time .
they tried to make these movie into parody
though they failed at every level .
most of the time it is just randomly inserted joke ,
that are so disgusting and raunchy
that it is hard to watch it
and enjoy it .
then when they do try to do scene
that are movie parody
they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene .
also for person saying
that its not for the older and real young audience 
well i fit into the age range
that it is supposed to be funny for .
while person say
that different person have different idea of what is funny or not ,
if you do find this funny
then you probably are not one of the more mature or intelligent person around .
it does not take that much skill to write that kind of a script ,
though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceball .
it is a movie parody
that is actually good and well done
and it did not have to use disgusting and raunchy joke
to make it funny either .
