this film is an attempt
to present jared diamond theory of `` gun 
germ and steel '' ,
explaining
how european have dominated much of the globe.the version i
saw of this documentary came on 2 discs
covering 3 hour .
i think
the information could have been presented in 20 minute .
there are completely useless scene of :
professor jared diamond watching bird through binocular 
professor jared diamond failing
to use a bow
and arrow properly ,
professor jared diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly .
was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of `` professor jared diamond ? `` .
this part of the documentary was so bad ,
it could have been a spoof .
the worst was
when diamond is shown eaking down and weeping
when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital .
none of this helps me understand his theory of `` gun 
germ and steel . ''
btw 
`` gun 
germ and steel '' is said about 100 time .
`` can the european gun ,
germ and steel get them out of this dire situation ?
stay tuned and find out ! ''
when he finally gets down to business ,
his theory is equal part interesting and utterly boring .
european conquered the native people of other land ,
because they had gun and fine blade against stone and wooden weapon .
do i really need a professor to convince me of this ?
the part of his theory
that explain
how the european came to have the advantage
that allow the conquest are interesting ,
but the coverage is paper-thin.in the end ,
i think
the documentary was only trying to convince me
that non-european are as capable as european .
if i am not a racist ,
i already know this .
if i am a racist ,
jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.i
do not think
adult are the intended audience for this documentary .
kid may enjoy this more than i 
though .
i have read
that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary .
