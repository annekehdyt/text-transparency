i do not know
what it is i find so endearing about this film ,
but the first time i saw it ,
i wanted to see
how it ended .
i am not a big fan of paul winfield nor of war-dramas ,
but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child .
all he knows
is that the boy has green eye .
truth be told ,
i have not seen this movie in year
nor has it been shown on tv in a while ,
but this movie is somewhat of one man 's odyssey after the pain of war .
winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man
lost by his memory .
there is an underlying message in this movie
that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality
that he does confront .
why this movie is not yet on dvd or video
is a mystery to me .
