lost is not the greatest tv show in history ,
but it is not far off .
it does not have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er 
however ,
it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across .
i love the way i can not guess what is going to happen .
i love the re-telling of the character ' back story
which often give rise to new dimension for us
to see them in .
in some way i want the show to last forever ,
but i think
they can get 6-7 season out of it
before they have to end it on a glorious high .
the combination of the character and their nationality coupled with the show 's fluidity for moving backward and forward thus extending dead character `` life span '' all adds to the overwhelming sense
that this show is something very different from what we are used to .
it is captivating ,
surprising
and ( here is a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy theorist )
more than a little interactive- keep
those internet discussion going-
you are only adding to the plot ...
