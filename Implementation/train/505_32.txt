i had an uncle
who committed suicide
after serving in vietnam
because of mental problem
he experienced
after coming back .
so
when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel i was intrigued .
i wanted to know
what my uncle went through and felt
as he got ready for vietnam .
i went out and rented this movie
and i have to say
it is the most heart-wrenching film i
have ever seen .
i bought the dvd immediately
after renting it .
the way
it pulls you in so many different direction emotionally
is something
i have never experienced with any other film .
as far as vietnam subject film go ,
i think
it is the best one ,
although platoon runs a close second .
besides all of that ,
i think
it is also colin farrell 's best performance as an actor .
i like him in most of his movie
but in this one he was incredible .
i gave this a 10 rating
because it is one of my top five favorite movie .
