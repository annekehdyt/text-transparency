although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movie ,
i find this movie to be particularly grating .
maybe
because i am from a different era and a different country ,
but i found crosby 's continual reference to the good old usa pleasant at first 
trite after a while
and then finally annoying .
do not get me wrong
- i am not anti-american whatsoever -
but it seemed that the english could do no right and/or needed this ave 
oh so smart american visitor
to show them the way .
it is a `` fish out of water '' story ,
but unlike most movie of this sort ,
this time it is the `` fish ''
who has the upper hand .
to be fair to both myself and the movie ,
i have watched it a few time spaced over a few year
and get the same impression each time .
( i watched another crosby movie last night
- the emperor 's waltz -
and that 
too 
produced the same reaction in me .
and to my surprise even my wife -
who for what is it is worth
is american -
found the `` in your face '' attitude of american crosby to be irritating .
one too many reference to teddy roosevelt ,
as she put it . )
as for the premise of the movie ,
it is unique enough for its day
and the supporting cast is of course very good .
the scenery and the music is also good ,
as are the great costume -
although i agree with a previous reviewer
that the wig on william bendix looks horrid
( picture moe of the three stooge )
.all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture
without the attitude of bing crosby
but because he is in virtually every shot
it is pretty hard to sit through this movie .
