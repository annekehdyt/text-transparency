imagine the worst skit from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie .
now 
imagine
that all the humor in those bad skit is removed and replaced with stupidity .
now imagine something 50 time worse.got that ? ok 
now go see the underground comedy movie .
that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever .
ucm is the single worst movie
i
have ever seen .
there were a few cheap laugh ... very few .
but it was lame .
even if the intent of the movie was to be lame ,
it was too lame to be funny.the only reason
i
am not angry for wasting my time
watching this was someone else
i know bought it .
he wasted his money .
vince offer has not written or directed anything else
and it is not surprise why .
