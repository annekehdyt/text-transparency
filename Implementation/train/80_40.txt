from the very opening scene
you will notice
just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'cruel intention ' ,
and how flat it landed .
you will also notice what a terrible choice
they made by casting robin dunne as valmont ... then in the second scene ,
you meet the two best thing in this movie 
amy adam and mimi roger as kathryn and her mother .
that is ,
if you can get past the fact
that kathryn was not blonde in the first film ...
then the movie goes on ,
you see the cheap romantic story from mile ago ,
and you notice
sebastian has already met an anette in the past 
here
called danielle ,
and a cecile 
here called cherie ...
how original is that for a prequel .
then it turns into a low budget 'wild thing ' type of film with lot and lot of oh-my `` twist '' .
as i mentioned ,
robin dunne was a very bad choice .
not that he is a bad actor ,
he is good..
he just does not have the charisma ryan did .
amy adam ,
who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actress of our time ,
once again deliver .
but with all the talent in the world 
there is no way one could save this trash .
as a whole 
this `` movie '' feel like a 'beverly hill 
90210 ' episode .
the score has been stolen from 'cruel intention ' and 'jaweaker ' ... yes ,
they used the score from jawbreaker ...
could not they at least leave that one alone ? !
you will want to pass this one .
if you want more cruel intention ,
watch stephen frear ' dangerous liaison .
