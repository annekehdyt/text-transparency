maaan 
where do i start with this god awful movie .
bad bad bad story telling .
i do not know
what the director was thinking
when he made this movie .
namaste london was quite an enjoyable movie
to be honest..even
the soundtrack was good .
but in this one..oh my good..for a movie
which is supposed to be a musical one..the song
are soooo bad .
ar rahman should have been the music director .
given two great actor a much better job should have been done by the director .
even though the first half suck 
the last 30 min of the movie are ok. performance from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.watch
it
if you have nothing better to do .
the last good movie from bollywood i watched
( and i do watch a load of them )
is dev d
and wake up sid .
