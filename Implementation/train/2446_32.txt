this is without a doubt
one of the best movie i have ever seen .
the first time i saw
it i was about 9 or 10 year old .
i began looking sometime before the rape scene .
and when i saw
it i was really shocked thinking `` what kinda sick movie is this ? `` .
today i have seen it from the beginning
and really understood how great this movie really is .
it is exciting 
frightening ,
shocking and in it is own unique way disturbing .
but the best thing about it is the ending
where the audience is shown
that this experience will haunt the character for the rest of their lifes .
it will torture their conscience
and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the body
being found in that river .
and there is nothing
they can do about it ,
it is something
they have to live with .
this ending is one of the most unhappy
ending in movie history
and very smart 
illiant and horrifyingand the acting is also great 
especially jon voight and burt reynold .
magnificent acting in this movie .
all in all 
john boorman has created one of the best movie throughout movie history
based on dick chaney 's novel .
a must see for all the movie lover
