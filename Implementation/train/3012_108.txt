recap :
full moon .
a creature 
a huge werewolf 
is on the hunt .
not for flesh 
not for blood
( not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though ) 
but for a mate .
he is on the hunt for a girl .
not any girl though .
the girl .
the girl
that is pure
( and also a werewolf ,
although she does not know it yet ) .
three 
well check that 
two cop
( after the first scene )
and an old bag lady is all
that can stop it ,
or even knows
that the thing killing
and eating a lot of folk around full moon
is a werewolf .
this particular powerful werewolf 
darkwolf 
is closing in on the girl .
if he gets her ,
mankind is doomed .
now the cop has to find the girl ,
convince her not only
that there is someone 
a werewolf nonetheless ,
that wants to rape her ,
and perhaps kill her ,
but that she is a werewolf herself .
and then they got to stop him ... comment :
this is one for the boy 
the teenage boy .
a lot of scene with semi-nude girl more or less important for the plot .
mostly less .
well i guess
you need something to fill some time
because the plot is ( expectedly )
thin .
and unfortunately there is little besides the girl
to help the plot from eaking .
one usually turns to two main theme .
nudity .
check .
and then special effect .
hmm ... well there are some thing
that you might call effect .
they are not very special though .
in fact ,
to be blunt ,
they are very bad .
the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of fund .
they could not afford clothe for some of the girl ; ) ,
and the effect are cheap .
some of the transformation between werewolf and human form ,
obviously done by computer ,
are really bad .
you might overlook such thing .
but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too ,
and you never get to see any killing .
just some mutilated corpse afterward .
and there is surprisingly little blood about 
in a movie
that honestly should be drenched in blood.i am not sure what to say about actor and character .
most of the time they do well ,
but unfortunately
there are lapse were the character
( or actor )
just looses it .
a few of these lapse could be connected with the problem mentioned above .
like the poor effect 
or the poor budget
( ? ) .
that could explain
why there is precious little shooting ,
even if the character are armed like a small army
and the target is in plain sight
( and not moving ) .
but hey ,
when you are in real danger ,
there nothing
that will save your life like a good one-liner ... unfortunately
that can not explain moment when the cop 
steve 
the only one
who knows how to maybe deal with the problem 
the werewolf
that is ,
runs away ,
when the only thing he can be sure of ,
is that the werewolf is coming for the girl ,
who is just beside him now ,
and that he can not let it have her .
but sure 
it let the maker stretch the ending a little more ...
but i would not mind
seeing none of the lead actor/actresses get another try in another movie.well .
to give a small conclusion :
not a movie
that i recommend.3/10
