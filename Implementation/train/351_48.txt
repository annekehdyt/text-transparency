any movie
in which brooke shield out-act a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror .
shield actually is only bad
because she is youthful 
inexperienced ,
and clearly not well directed by her co-star .
peter fonda is bad because 
well ,
because he is bad .
i liked him in ulee 's gold 
year later 
but lord above 
he is awful here .
not that anyone else is good .
there is not a single performance
( outside henry fonda 's delightful cameo )
that is even passable .
i have never seen a movie with this many bad performance .
in the case of luke askew 
the chief villain 
it is clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction ,
as he is done good work in the past .
but his partner ,
played by ted markland ,
is an embarrassing ham .
the writing is just bloody awful ,
and the actor can not be faulted for the terrible thing
they have to say .
but they say them so badly !
the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian .
shot are held way too long for no dramatic reason 
or cut off
before the impact of the scene can be realized .
this picture was far worse
than i would imagined
and would have been utterly forgotten
( and probably never even made )
without the participation of a couple of famous name .
one ight spot :
the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite ,
capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big-screen imax production have not quite done so well .
and finally :
either this is a bad version of paper moon 
with a lovable pair of father-daughter type ,
or it is a bad version of pretty baby 
with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty-something and a 13-year-old .
it suggests more of the latter than the former ,
and thus is pretty disturbing .
