flat 
soulless computer image on less than astonishing background animates a horribly predictable story in this film .
absolutely nothing takes you by surprise ,
you can even tell
when the bryan adams vocal are going to come in ,
which are always at the wrong time.the main character ,
spirit the horse 
is given an annoying voice
when he narrates what is happening .
the narration is not needed 
though ,
as everything happening is really obvious .
you can even tell what the horse are saying ,
although all they do is neigh .
which would be good ,
but all the horse make exactly the same sounds - one for warning 
one for sorrow 
one for laughing 
etc .
there is no variation between the horse ' voices.young kid might like this film 
though .
it is soppy enough for a family
to sit down and watch ,
and there is little danger of anyone
being frightened .
if you have nothing else to do ,
and want to watch a film with your kid ,
this is not a bad choice.but otherwise ,
this is not recommended .
