this film is deeply disappointing .
not only
that wender only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blue ,
it is his subjective and personal interest in part of the music
he ings on film
that make watching
and listening absolutely boring .
the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple
who were befriended with j.b. lenoir
and show their private video footage as well as tell story .
wender 's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world 's culture
( or actually 
american culture )
traveling in space ,
but his limited look on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of story from the 30s render this movie as a mere sleeping aid .
yawn .
i had expected more of him .
