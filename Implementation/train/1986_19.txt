this movie is so bad
that i can not even begin to describe it .
what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writer 
producer and director ?
how on earth did they get funding for this abomination ?
the plot is laughable ,
the acting is poor at best ,
the story ... what story ?
the first fight in this movie is ok
but then it keeps repeating itself
until you want to turn it off.i guess
i am the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute .
*** spoler alert ***i only saw this movie
because scott adkin was in it ...
and he is in it ... for 30 second ... i give it 1/10
because it is the lowest grade imdb has to offer.do yourself a favour :
see an uwe boll movie
instead ... twice ...
it is more worthy of your time .
