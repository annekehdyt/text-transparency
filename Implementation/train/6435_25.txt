the problem with this film are many ,
but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome one .
first of all ,
while the theme suggests a number of vignette about manhattan life ,
the reality was that everything ,
as usual in movie and tv ,
was about something bizarre 
usually of a sexual nature .
the story line were thin or nonexistent 
and virtually every scene 
camera shot 
line of dialog ,
and expressed emotion was absolutely 
and totally fake .
it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage
that i walked out
( something no uncommon for me in recent year . )
i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop out from some 3rd rate film study program ,
but i believe
the
( at one time 
pre-amelia 
talented )
director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty ,
so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool .
