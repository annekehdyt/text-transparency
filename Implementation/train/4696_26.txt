this is an excellent stand-up dvd !
eddie izzard is the funniest person
i have seen in year .
his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with other
who have seen it .
i highly recommend this one .
the part about the history of europe is a bit slow ,
but the ending joke in french are quite good ,
because you do not have to speak french
to get it
( although if you do ,
it is still hilarious ) .
also ,
the part about being a transvestite
are quite good .
the first scene
( about san francisco )
is not great ,
but funny the first time .
skip over those if you can .
it is almost not worth watching .
however 
this really is a funny 
funny stand-up show
that everyone should see .
