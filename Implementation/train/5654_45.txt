i am from romania i
will try to speak in english .
all i want to say
about this movie is that it is
and will be my all time number one .
seen it above 30 time at least
and will see it for many year now .
it has all the little thing i like in a movie ,
it is very touching makes me cry .
shows a whole lot of twisted love thing and question about love and reality 
and the true thing
that matter for different person .
it so happens
that for me this matters the most 
the love 
the soul of a man 
he is inner being ,
and this i see in this movie .
perhaps for me it is much more than a motion picture ,
it is a proof in my mind
that it could really exist
and that you most make the best out of every moment
you live with your soul mate .
it is a long way from reality to sci-fi 
but .. what if .
what
if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down ,
would fall ?
we would all be concerned about other issue
and my thought is that ,
on your death bed ,
the bigger thing you remember ,
is not the wealth 
not the adventure 
not the country you visited and the person
that remember you .
but the true friend and your true love and the hope
that
after you die ,
all will be god damn perfect
and person
would be good and care more .
watch this movie and probably it will guide you
through your life like it did to me : )
hail from romania
