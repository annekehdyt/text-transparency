some bad review here for this and i understand why
but treat it as a low budget serial killer film
and you might get more from it than most.i thought
that this worked in a way
because afterward i felt dirty
and wanted to take a long shower
so
that is some degree of success is not it ?
i would say
there is just the right level of sleaze here
to get under your skin
although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven .
david hess is only in this ielfy
so don not get your hope up to much
if you like last house.other than that - worth a look .
