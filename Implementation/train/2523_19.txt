you know
you are in trouble
when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie ,
and `` the incubus '' is a dreadful ,
worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motion
to pay the bill .
actually 
observing the hammy script and john hough 's 'baroque ' art direction 
one can hardly blame him .
the movie has something to do with a series of rape-murder going on in a small town ,
with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in .
somehow 
the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene ,
and cassavetes seems visibly p.o .
'ed at time .
the incubus itself ,
which does not show up until the last scene ,
is a well-done creation ,
but it is not worth waiting for.1/10
