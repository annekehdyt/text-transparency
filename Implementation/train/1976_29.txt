a tour deforce !
ok the kid
that plays oliver
is a bit toooooo sweet !
starting with the great cinematography 
color 
costume and most impressive performance this is a must see movie .
i have seen several adaptation of this great novel ,
but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot !
it is a masterful fagan ,
never leaving his character
to do a song .
you never really know
if you like him or not ,
the same feeling i got in the book .
in other version you hate him from start to finish .
bill syke ... .
when you read the book hes a mean one ,
and so he is in this movie .
oliver reed was masterful .
his wife directed this masterpiece .
i went
and saw his last movie ,
gladiator
based on his many fine performance ,
not to see the headliner .
the music fits the time and the mood .
who will buy this beautiful movie ?
you should !
