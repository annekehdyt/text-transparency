i rented this some year ago ,
the video store had only vhs at the time .
straight to video was hitting
it is stride
( you know ,
where the box covers use the same font and color scheme of successful film )
.i did not know what to expect other than what was printed .
first thing i thought
while watching was `` what the hell ' wrong with the sound ?
`` -obviously there was no dialogue dubbing .
word echoed 
so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention-mind
you there is no shakespeare here ! ,
just simple talk .
the story is simple enough ,
boy meet girl etc..
what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was ,
the person in the movie did not seem like caricature written into the story ,
but rather non-actor plucked temporarily from their real job
( uniform included ) .
all the while 
you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after ,
then see that there are no attempt at cheap humor
( person hurting their private ,
using vulgarity this could not have hurt the marketing .
there was something honest about it .
i thought
if they had have a bigger budget
then
it would have been better ,
which i am sure
they considered daily 
but ,
they went ahead and made it .
this 
i felt ,
was what independent film-making is all about.the word `` indy '' ,
is thrown around
as if it is a genre..ha ! ..that
is funny !
