i wanted to see it
because of two reason .
one 
it was the remake of high sierra with bogart 
two ,
the bogart part was played by jack palance ,
whom can play dramatic role with some subtility ,
as in the big knife.but now i wonder
why they decided to shoot this remake .
the film follows the same plot as hig sierra ;
only here 
the actor do not care ,
the director is lost in his thought ,
and who knows
what the producer was thinking .
jack palance is getting bored
looking at shelley winter and shelley winter is asking herself
what she is doing in this film .
i do not even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role .
and of course 
they had to use the dog story again !
they surely could have come up with some different idea .
perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location
where they shot high sierra ,
but that definitely does not add any quality to the film.it is a waste of time
if you have seen high sierra before .
otherwise 
why not see a pseudo-film noir .
as for me 
i would rather die
than see it one more time ...
