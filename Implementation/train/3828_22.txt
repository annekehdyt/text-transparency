if you want to see intelligent ,
philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential 
watch `` waking life 
''
which is illiant .
`` what the # $ * !
do we know ''
is all over the place in its focus ,
poorly directed ,
poorly written ,
poorly acted ,
utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying .
it was not thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest .
the inclusion of that rambling freak `` ramtha '' in this film is reason enough to avoid it .
is not it strange how the filmmaker choose to look over the fact
that this woman worships some 2,000 year old atlantian god or something ?
what a flake
that old chick is ,
and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was .
the person
responsible for this film
should not be allowed to make another movie ever again .
