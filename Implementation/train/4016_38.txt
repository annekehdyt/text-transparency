the film transported everyone back to october 20 ,
1944
where we seemed to be part of the great philippine 'i shall return ' landing scene
it was on that leyte shore
where general macarthur reaped his fame above all ,
gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general
it is the stride 
the set of the shoulder 
the intensity it is what both man have had in common : intensity 
total absorption 
devotion with macarthur it was for the military with peck it was for the challenge of acting an academy award winner for `` to kill a mockinbird '' 
an oscar nominee for `` key to the kingdom '' 
`` the yearling '' 
`` gentleman 's agreemant '' 
and `` twelve o'clock high '' \u0097he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist ;
from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney ; from biblical david to captain horatio hornblower
he has ought to them all his own unique insight 
his character 
his sincerity 
warmth and love 
and especially ,
his humor there is a scene
where 'macarthur ' stand on deck with the 'president of the philippine . '
we can hear the dialogue :
`` general 
i hope
the water is not too deep 
''
says the 'president 
'
`` because my person will find out i can not swim . ''
then come peck 's sonorous voice :
`` and my person are going to find
that i can not walk on water ! ''
as `` macarthur 
'' peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry through him we felt macarthur 's emotion :
we knew his anger 
his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family
