after seeing dick tracy in the 6.99 $ bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge
and being a big fan of mafia and crime movie .
i was very surprised to see a very fun 
smart entertaining movie with solid performance throughout .
the movie moves along well ,
it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty ,
but the real standout of the film are al pacino and madonna .
i was happy to find out
that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying
to take down the city .
madonna was great as the damsel in distress ,
she really impressed me
and added depth to her performance .
if you go in with the attitude of wanting
to watch a fun 
smart movie with great acting and a solid script
then give dick tracy a try .
i do not think
you will be disappointed .
and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino 
jame caan 
kathy bate and dustin hoffman among other .
