the premise sucked me in ,
but it was clear about 30 second in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible .
interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list .
i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece
( romero comes to mind ) ,
but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one .
the message seems to be
that we must all pretend
we have an iq of 80
( or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya ? )
and blindly follow the bible
without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we will trigger the second coming .
it is the kind of attitude
that makes person fly jumbo jet into 110 story building
( i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc ) .
i like to think
that god is a little greater than that .
