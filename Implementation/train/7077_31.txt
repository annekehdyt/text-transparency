i think
this cartoon is one of the worst cartoon i
have ever watched .
i would recommend this cartoon to person
who are under 5. i
did used to like this show
when i was 4 and 5 
i still only watched it
when there was nothing on .
now i am
other 5 and i would rather do my homework than watch it .
the cartoon used to be a bit funny
but they were not enough
to make me burst out laughing .
now i am older i am
interested in show witch are not rated us .
i have started to watch doctor who
( 12a ) ,
torchwood
( 15 )
and sarah jane adventure
( pg ) .
i am interested in thing to do with doctor
who so i am
not interested in 5 year old cartoon .
this cartoon did not last very long
it only had 6 season ,
it got cancelled
because of it was low on viewer
but some person say
it was because the writer ran out of idea but for most other show they have at least 8 season .
