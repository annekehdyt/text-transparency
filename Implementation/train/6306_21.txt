the movie is very lengthy
and unfortunately pretty different from the novel .
if you want to see the movie
then do not read the novel first
as it will shock you .
however 
cinematography was ok
and if you are a person
who loves adventure genre
which explores africa then go for it .
acting performance are adequate 
however ,
many important event
that were present in the novel
are omitted .
in the novel 
sir henry curtis was in search of his missing other rather than a lady in search of her father .
gagool was cunning
and was killed in the cave whereas here
she was shown to be a good person
who preferred to stay with the new king .
