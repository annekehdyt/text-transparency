i saw this movie a couple year back .
i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on .
so i peeped it .
what really gets me is it makes no sense
and that why its disturbing .
richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis start making out with richard 's girl
while she is unconscious .
then jarvis 's buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar .
by the next morning it shows richard 's girl
talking to jarvis and trouby
and then she walks back to richard and looks at him
while he is still tied up .
then they play some happy music
and the movie is finished .
i mean what happened ?
did they ake up ?
and what was she saying to those 2 guy
( trouby and jarvis ) ?
its to puzzling and to poor to .
i can not stand movie
that are disturbing
and do not make sense .
this was the worst film i have ever seen since the 90 's version of lord of the fly .
