this show is quick-witted 
colorful 
dark yet fun 
hip and still somehow clean .
the cast ,
including an awesome rotation of special guest
( i.e .
molly shannon 
paul ruben 
the-stapler-guy-from-office-space ) is electric .
it is got murder 
romance 
family 
and zombie
without ever coming off as cartoony ... somehow .
you really connect with these character .
the whole production is an unlikely magic act
that left me ,
something of a skeptic
if i do say
so myself ,
totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night .
i just re-read this
and it sounds a little like somebody
paid me to write it .
it really is that good .
i just heard a rumor
that it was being canceled so i thought
i would send off a flare of good will .
this is one of those show
that goes under the radar
because the network suit can not figure out how to make it sexy
and sell car with it .
do yourself a huge favor ,
if you have not already ,
and enjoy this gem
while it lasts .
ok so one more thing .
this show is clever .
what that means is that every armchair critic/ '' writer '' in hollywood is gon na insert a stick up their youknowwhat
before they sit down to watch it ,
defending themselves with an `` i could have written that '' type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room .
in other word :
the internet .
this is a general interest/anonymous website .
before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model rerun
or whatever other out and out tripe these internet `` critic '' are not commenting on ,
give my fave ' show a spin .
it is fun .
good 
unpretentious fun .
