its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movie of all time in my book .
this poor copy steal lot of material from the first three film going as far as even copying how person die and what will happen in the future to the key character
and it basically tries to cram in three film into one and fails .
it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one
( except with the odd exception
where the impressive choral music ings back memory of the old film )
.the only thing
we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v .
