in the fan robert de niro play gil renard .
or is it travis bickle ?
or rupert pupkin ?
or max cady ?
you see the problem with this type of role
is that de niro has played very very similar character in taxi driver 
the king of comedy and cape fear
and unfortunately the character were better developed
and had better script .
i found
it slightly difficult to believe
that renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sport fan
into being an out and out psychothe character arc is not the only problem with this script -
it also lacks a character focus
( a problem
i had with the untouchable
where de niro should have been superb
but ended up slightly flat ) ,
for several stretch of the movie i kept thinking
that bobby rayburn was the main character
then the story switches back to renard .
it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sport fan
who seem to think
this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball .
i am not sure
if this was meant to appeal to baseball fan originally
but again there are element
which hint it might have
if the producer had made up their mind
has to who
and what the story should focus upon i will admit
i was entertained by the fan
( especially by the soundtrack )
but it is a very flawed film
and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s character
being stalked by nutter as in single white female ,
unlawful entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago
