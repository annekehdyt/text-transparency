jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent .
like all her film 
'bonjour tristesse ' suffer not at all from her look
( though she is perhaps the first of those modern woman
whom tom wolfe gleefully ,
accurately describes as `` boy with east '' :
publicist 
of course 
use the word `` gamine '' )
but suffer grievously from seberg 's dull 
monotonous 
killing voice .
in all her film
when had to play anger ,
seberg played it with grossly audible 
distracting 
gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalization .
oy.preminger 's adaptation of fran\u00e7oise sagan 's eathlessly juvenile 
fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography -
but then that is difficult to funk on the photogenic french riviera 
and perhaps for his apt 
but certainly not groundeaking 
employment of black and white for the present day scene
from which seberg 's monotone narration deliver us to the flashed-back-to color past.juliette gr\u00e9co has a ief moment 
as a nightclub chanteuse in the black and white spotlight ,
delivering in smoky dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song .
this moment is nowaday 
in retrospect 
more than a wee bit dr\u00f4le .
except 
of course ,
if you are french -
particularly if you are a french `` 68-er '' longing for the glorious day of the barricade roundabout the sorbonne - and your kid riot to retain the lifelong sinecure
which have blighted and emasculated france 's economy :
then you still believe in sartre and foucault and all such arcane ,
irrelevant theorists.david niven has the hardest role ,
having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist
who 's yet to grasp
that life is not all about sagan 's teenybopper notion of a hip 
cool 
swingin ' 
`` mon copain ! ''
papa .
deborah kerr deliver her usual 
consummately professional presence 
convincingly
playing the woman
who suffer undeservedly seberg 's spiteful teenaged snot-nose jealousy
( fulfilling sagan 's shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of `` there can be only one queen bee in the hive '' ) ;
in fact 
to kerr belong this film 's sole great and memorable on-screen moment.the dialogue is unnatural - i agree with an earlier reviewer
who said
that it sounds to be `` badly translated '' from french ;
combine the unnatural scripting with seberg 's incomparably dull 
unendurable monotone
and you can save that valium for another night .
atop all that the ineptly synched post-production voice dubbing is 
almost throughout 
obvious and thus much more than irksome :
this is especially true of the dubbing for myl\u00e8ne demongeot
because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.hunky geoffrey horne gets the short end of the stick here
- a very good looking young man
who also suffered from a less-than-lovely 
uncinematic voice
which ,
when paired with seberg 's drone 
yield unconvincing scene of puppy love .
( horne was ,
shall we say ,
merely adequate in 'bridge on the river kwai 
'
perhaps
because his end was held up by those great cinema pro william holden and jack hawkin
instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted seberg )
.in sum 'bonjour tristesse ' is pretty to look at
but it is shallow 
immature soap :
thin gruel with sud .
