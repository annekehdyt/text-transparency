ulyss as a film should in no way
be compared with the novel ,
for they are two entirely different entity .
however ,
that being said ,
the film still manages to maintain many of the element
that made the book work ,
but since it is a visual medium ,
it is more difficult to pull of stream-of-consciousness .
i think
this is the best film
they could have made with the material ...
and this is from someone
that routinely rants about film not being like their literary counterpart .
i recommend the book ,
but the movie is still entertaining .
