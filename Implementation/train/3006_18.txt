do you like stand up ?
then stay away from this ... during the early round ,
there are in fact good comic ,
but unless they got some cute quality ,
they got a snowball chance .
any controversial material and you are out !
... and i think
i hurt as much as the discarded comedian ,
when i see
who the crooked judge are letting in.1 out of my top 4
made it further than the preliminary .
half+ of the finalist have given me 0 laugh .
several of them have lifted their material elsewhere ,
something the judge does not seem to have problem with.it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv 
but incredibly hard to watch
without contemplating what it could have been.if the producer changed the name of the contest to `` last clown standing '' ,
all my criticism would loose validity .
maybe an idea ?
