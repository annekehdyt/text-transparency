fiction film
( it lists as based on a story
though it does have a `` documented by '' credit )
about a group of scientist going into the wild of canada
to try and find a bigfoot .
( they want to capture one and then attach a tracking device ) .
its lot of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of person wandering around in the wilderness .
there are some attempt at creating tension and scare ,
but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth
seeing outside of some great looking shot of the wild .
this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film ,
it promises you so much ,
a look at bigfoot ,
but in reality it delivers very little .
recommended for insomniacs only
