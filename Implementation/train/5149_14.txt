i first saw this film 40 year ago on n.y. television ,
and thought
it was a depressing look at the future .
well sees restriction of private freedom as a good thing .
( `` no private airplane '' .
the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason
this film was not shown to british film goer
doing the war .
the concept of the future ,
and the korda an co. concept of the the machine of the future are the real star of the film .
the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss .
a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series .
it is interesting to note
that the boss 's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill .
