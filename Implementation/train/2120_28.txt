an absolute steaming pile of cow dung .
it is mind-blowing to me
that this film was even made .
hip-hop and old western just do not seem to mix .
what target audience were these person thinking
of when planning this trainwreck.not only is the concept
and plot a joke ,
but the acting is atrocious and the fact
that some decent actor were even in this nightmare of a film
makes their entire career a laughing stock .
the chick from clueless should never be forgiven
and she is stripped of any remaining dignity
she had .
after reading the first ten page of dialogue
she should have been asking
which one of her friend was playing this sick joke .
after some research 
i actually found a list of some other actor
who passed on this film :
jada pinkett-smith 
denzel washington 
brandy 
monique 
kim kardasian 
jenna jameson 
oprah ,
and finally marge simpson.simply put ,
i would rather stare at a blank tv than watch this movie again .
