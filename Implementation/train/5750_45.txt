this could be the most underrated movie of its genre .
i do not remember seeing any advertisement or commercial for this one
which could be the reason
why it did not do so well at the box office .
however 
frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie .
i rank
it within the top 10 most favorite horror movie on my list.movie begins with snapshot of photo and news article
telling us about a killer
who calls himself `` god 's hand '' .
and then a man walks into a police station
and tells the chief officer
that
he knows
the killer is his other .
two of them leave together to go to a location
where victim are buried
which might help solve the case .
during that trip 
the man begins telling the story of his other
and we go back in time
when the event began .
fenton and adam are two young other
living with their strict and religious father
who 
one day 
claims
that he has received a divine message from god
asking him
to kill the demon
that appear to be regular human being .
he receives from god a list of name of demon
to be destroyed
and asks his son to help him carry out this divine mission.this
is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film
that will keep you at the edge of your seat .
the tension runs high 
innocent person
( or demon ? )
get killed and religious experience are questioned .
it has not one but few very intelligent twist at the end .
if you like this genre ,
i highly recommend frailty for you .
i own the dvd
and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thriller .
