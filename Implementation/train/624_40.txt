when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it ,
i mean whole city being wiped out by killer tomato !
sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.led by detective dick mason 
a special team of military and scientist
( including greg colburn
who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt. finletter
who is never pictured
without his parachute trailing behind )
'attack of the killer tomato ' is a parody of b-movie 
in particular japanese horror of the 1950 's .
the film begins with a standard sized tomato
being discovered by a woman washing up in her kitchen
before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene
as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady ,
and let me tell you
it does not get any saner as the film progresses !
to be fair
there are a couple of funny moment ,
for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent ,
or
when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomato 'hey ,
can somebody please pass the ketchup ? ' .
equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole
so bad its good concept .
unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomato ' spoof film such as the 'airplane ' and 'naked gun ' series have been released
and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.the acting is atrocious ;
there is zero continuity in the editing
and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy .
for a parody film to work you need a lot of thing happening at once 
one gag after the over .
the singing in the film seems pointless and the advert for the furniture store
that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre 
even for this film .
ultimately 
however 
you can see
why this film is a cult one ;
i can not see many person being indifferent to it .
unfortunately terrible would be the way
i would sum this up .
