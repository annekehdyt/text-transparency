i actually did not start watching the show
until it came on fx .
i was bored
and had nothing to watch
and saw
that the show 's rerun were premiering so i decided to watch it .
i was so upset
that i had not watched the show
when it first aired on t.v .
i loved the show so much ! finally a show
for everyone to enjoy .
i remember full house and family matter and step by step
and they were okay show
but just not funny enough .
they would make dumb joke and laugh over thing
that were just plain stupid ,
but not that 70s show .
that 70s show was hilarious 
smart and so real .
i think
it was the best show ever made and i am very sorry
that it ended .
although i love this show 
i do think
it should have ended on the seventh season
when eric and kelso leave .
the last season was just not right ,
eric was the main character
and the show should have ended
when his character leaves .
i still love this show
and i hope tv start making more show like this one .
