i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degree .
if enough person do the same then it could be enough to ing this fabulous show back to life ! !
just go onto the official site
and the rest is simple enough .
i do not understand
why this show has been cancelled .
what a fantastic show 
cast and character .
the whole concept is gripping viewing !
i am astounded
that my favourite show is over after just one series .
why is this ?
six degree is phenomenal ,
it is better than so many other tv programme out there !
until i heard they were stopping it from a friend
it had not even occurred to me
that this might happen .
