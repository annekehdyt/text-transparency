when i saw the dentist ,
i thought
it was very cool .
but this movie is not for everyone 
especially person
who do not like gory scene
as the dentist has lot of gory scene .
that is why it has it is r18 rating .
it is about a beverly hill dentist dr alan feinstone ,
who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman .
it is best to go to your dentist
`` before '' you watch this .
but if you do not like going to the dentist already ,
then it is best not to watch this
as you may be put off going for life .
the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i have ever seen .
who has ever seen a movie
that has a dentist
( spoiler )
pull out all his cheating wife 's tooth
and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic ?
overall awesome flick 
but not for everyone .
