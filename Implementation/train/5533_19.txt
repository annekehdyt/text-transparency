i still find it difficult to comprehend
that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood .
the acting and story is simply pathetic
and the direction is awful .
i do not see any logic behind this trash except may be
that the director had nothing good to do .
i took me ten minute
to realize
that i had wasted my precious thirty rupee .
it filled me with dismay
that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap .
i bet
the movie was made in less than a day .
i do not know what category it falls into .
please 
avoid this movie at all cost ,
just do anything ,
even bang your head against wall
but do not go for this movie .
