this is a gorgeous movie visually .
the image of the mexican desert 
the old mansion 
the character in their picturesque costume ...
all amount to a real work of art.the story seems a bit loose ,
but that is because it is not meant to be realistic .
it is taken from a book
called one hundred year of solitude ,
and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated 
otherworldly atmosphere of latin america `` so far from god ,
and so close to the united state '' .
the tremendous debt
that erendira owes to her grandmother
is symbolic of latin america 's international debt burden ,
although there many layer of meaning.if you can appreciate a slow-moving 
richly-textured movie ,
this one is for you .
