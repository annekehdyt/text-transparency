this movie contains no humor for anyone
who has lived with a family member
who has a mental illness .
so many scene reminded me too graphically of my own life experience .
this movie was the man 's version of `` mommy dearest . ''
it depicts both graphically
and accurately the life many child of a mentally ill parent goes through .
it also shows
how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god .
someone told me
it was funny .
no way 
i say !
it is sick humor at best .
the movie is so intense and depressing
that my son and i had to leave the room .
the best use for this movie is for person
who do not understand mental illness
or do not believe
what we family actually do live through .
