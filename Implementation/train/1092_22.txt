`` black angel '' is minor whodunit 
with june vincent as a woman
trying to save her husband from the electric chair
after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance .
dan duryea
( the husband of the murdered woman )
decides to help vincent find the real culprit .
peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect .
this film noir look
and play like a cheap programmer ,
never achieving anything special .
it is pleasant enough
but then 
at some point ,
it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big `` give me a eak '' reaction .
that
ending alone could have sank the film completely ,
but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either .
vincent is a wimpy heroine
and duryea was never very good at playing good guy .
i love film noir ,
but this one was a real disappointment .
