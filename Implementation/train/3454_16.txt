i rented this movie on dvd
without knowing what to expect - and as i am about to study film-making in canada of all place ,
i most certainly will ing this up in class.the story ,
centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself ,
is illiantly written and the very talented actor manage to deliver every single pun on time.if
you simply could not laugh during `` hollywood north '' i suggest
seeing a psychiatrist right away -
you might have serious issues.beside the wonderful script i
also noticed the great chemistry between actor deborah kara unger and matthew modine -
where they really just acting ?
jennifer tilly
( playing a hilariously bad actress )
and martin landau ,
also delivered a very edgy ,
yet funny performance.great film 
even better cast .
