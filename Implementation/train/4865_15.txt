personally 
i find the movie to be quite a good watch .
it outlines the actual situation of triad in hong kong
and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triad are organized.not only that 
it also shows the viewer how the hong kong polouse control the triad situation
and why the polouse do not just go all out and wipe out triad.overall ,
the movie is rather violent due to the gangland method of killing and torture .
nevertheless 
the movie stays true to the real world ,
thus the violence on screen is just a reflection
of what really happens.i would recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan .
another good watch would be dragon squad .
that movie has more gun than this ,
as in this movie there is more knife than gun
( in fact i do not remember seeing a single gun ) .
