as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie -
especially as it had scotty nyugen in it.basically ,
scotty nyugen short spot in this film are all
it has going for it.the character
are unlikeable and annoying ,
the soundtrack is awful
and the plot 
well ,
there is not one.i honestly got a headache
and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box
after twenty minute i was that bored .
its actually ashame
that nyugen was in this movie
as otherwise i would not have wasted $ 16 buying it off ebay.take it from me -
avoid like 7 2 offsuit ! ! !
dire .
