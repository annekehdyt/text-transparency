i really did not like this film .
the plot was very predictable .
typical american plot 
i am sorry .
guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end .
and london has a monorail ?
bank of london ? ? ?
bank of england is what it really is ! !
- i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbird themselves .
and the brit were baddy ?
( apart from parker and lady penelope )
what was up with that ?
oh and they kept on saying stuff like `` here come 'the thunderbird ' '' -
but it was never known as 'the thunderbird ' in the series ,
why do that ? ?
i would like to see this re-made in 20 year with more british cast .
i preferred the original series .
sorry !
