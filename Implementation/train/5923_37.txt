if you have seen other movie like this ,
they are probably better .
the omega man comes to mind .
to the studio 's credit 
they avoided the sprawling 
unnecessary 
big budget technofest
that typifies movie of this ilk .
additionally 
the set-up and premise were excellent :
four person
whose past is virtually irrelevant to us
are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease .
what is bad is everything else !
i get tired of endlessly stupid 
careless 
wimpy 
ineffective 
arrogant character in a movie .
that pretty much describe everyone in the movie at some point .
i rented it ,
and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly ,
`` no 
do not do that !
`` 
`` why are you so stupid '' ,
`` look out !
`` 
etcetera .
a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in .
a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the character
so
that you actually care what happens to them .
this one does not .
also 
there should have been a longer ,
more involving end to the movie as well .
