the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion ,
as the relationship 
setting 
acting and social context all lead to the same place :
confusion .
even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element ,
and lacks his usual impeccable clarity 
direction and intensity .
to make matter worse ,
his character 's name is 'che ' ,
and we are only told
( directly 
by the narrator )
well into the film
that he is not 'that ' che ,
just a guy named che .
the family relationship remain unclear until the end of the film ,
and once defined 
the family is divided - the younger generation off to america .
so clich\u00e9 .
other review discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy 's family ;
however the political stance of the director is murky at best ,
and we are never quite sure
who is responsible for what bloodshed .
so they lost their property
( acquired by gambling profit )
- so what ?
refusing to take a political stand ,
when making a movie about the cuban revolution ,
is an odd and cowardly choice .
not to mention the movie was in english !
why are all these cuban speaking english ?
no wonder
they did not get permission to film in cuba .
and if family life is most important to look at here ,
it would be great
if we could figure out
who is who -
we are 'introduced ' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way
out of making the relationship clear throughout the film !
the acting was mostly shallow 
wooden 
and unbelievable ,
timing was off all around .
the 'special ' visual effect were confusing and distracting .
reference to american film - and the black character as greek chorus - strictly gratuitous 
intellectually ostentatious ,
and consistently out of place .
i only watched the whole movie
because i was waiting for clarity 
or some point
to it all .
it never happened .
