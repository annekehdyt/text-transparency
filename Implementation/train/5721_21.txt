`` the day time ended ''
is an incredible picture .
in some way 
it is better than `` close encounter of the third kind . ''
( i prefer cheesy independent flick to big budget spectacular . )
the special effect are cheesy ,
but that is a big part of the fun .
jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film .
it is probably one of the best role
he ever had in a feature .
the musical score is very good .
the story does not make sense .
but that only makes it all the more intriguing .
like many of the best work of art ,
`` the day time ended ''
is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous .
`` the day time ended ''
may be a low budget indie film ,
but it is not too much of a stretch
to compare it with the `` existential '' european film of the fifty and sixty .
( many of which were low budget independent production themselves . )
