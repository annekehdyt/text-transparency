impactful film of four city slicker in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity .
each of four businessman face their darkest fear
when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip ,
on a river about to be replaced by a dam .
when local along the way decide to `` have their way ''
with the interloper it leads to several death and load of trauma for the survivor .
each of the traveler is outstanding ,
although voight gives the lead and strongest performance .
the rural scenery and culture is well-captured ,
including the eathtaking dueling banjos sequence .
i saw this on a date
when it came out ,
not exactly the perfect date movie
( although we both enjoyed it ) .
i sort of remember this as a eak-out dramatic performance for burt ,
voight was already established .
not the sort of movie you could watch every week
but it has a strong punch
and is beautifully filmed .
