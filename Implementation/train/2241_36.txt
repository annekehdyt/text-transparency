according to john ford 's lyrically shot ,
fictional biopic of aaham lincoln 's life his greatest fault may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in `` the worst way . ''
ford 's camera has only praising view to reveal of mr. lincoln 's early life .
but for what the film lacks in character complexity
it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision .
uncharacteristically beautiful composition of early film ,
what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ,
ford has a unique eye for telling a story .
the film sing of the life of a hopeful young man .
henry fonda plays the contemplative
and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee 
one of his best roles.the film concern two young man 
other 
on trial for a murder
that both claim to have committed .
in classic angry mob style 
the town decides to take justice into their own hand and lynch the pair of them 
until honest abe step into the fray .
he charms them with his humor ,
telling them not to rob him of his first big case ,
and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boy lawyer .
what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter 
as abe cunningly interrogates witness to the delight and humor of the judge 
jury and town
before he stumbles upon the missing links.the film
plays out like many john ford movie do :
a tablespoon of americana 
a dash of moderate predictability 
a hint of sarcasm
that you are not sure
if you put in the recipe
or if ford did it himself .
despite the overtly 'hollywood ' feel of the film ,
and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln 's future presidency ,
the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed ,
if you can take your drama with a grain of salt .
