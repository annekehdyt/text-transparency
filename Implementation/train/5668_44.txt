i watched the babysitter as part of bci eclipse ' drive-in cult classic
( featuring crown international picture releases )
on dvd .
i think
it is a very good film.this movie packs a lot of story into a very short time .
you have hippie 
rock music 
biker 
lesbian 
sexual impropriety 
blackmail 
and murder 
all in one spot !
the lead actor do a credible job .
and 
i found the intricately woven plot
to be believable and interesting.however ,
the supporting cast 
primarily the biker 
delivers a stilted performance ,
particularly when asked to deliver line with more than just a few word .
perhaps they used real biker 
instead of actor .
a couple of the character 
in particular 
were exceptionally believable.the musical score is absolutely spot-on 
for the time 
the tempo 
and for moving the story forward .
i found the music a real treat .
i noticed in the opening credit
that the movie featured the music of `` the food 
''
i googled them ;
but 
could not find anything ... in any case 
george e. carey
who wrote ,
produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much
( of a wayward married man ought to redemption through trial and tribulation ;
and 
a little help - of course )
that he wrote ,
produced and starred in `` weekend with the babysitter . ''
