dolph lundgren ood and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller
that is not nearly as cool
as the box would have you believe .
he is actually quite good here ,
but the story is a mess of b-movie clich
( detective 
revenge 
tycoon 
hooker 
sandm )
that looks like it was made up
as they went along .
the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick 
rent red scorpion instead .
