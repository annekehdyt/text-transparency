my family and i screened underdog the night before .
and as bad
as underdog is
( my four year old loved it ) ,
hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material .
the only thing
that could have saved this movie ,
was if evel himself had come out of retirement to slap samberg in the face
for making this movie .
i will admit however ,
that the soundtrack was good .
i was not sure
if the movie was set in the 80 's 
but with the majority of the music coming from europe ?
who knows .
if i were you ,
i would take a pass .
and just stay at home
and watch the test pattern on your local tv station .
or if you are dead set on watching this ,
person under the influence might enjoy it .
