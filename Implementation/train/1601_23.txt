solino really moved me with its deeply drawn character .
while being a simple tale of rivalry between two other ,
it was not simply about hate or jealousy .
what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feeling
gigi was going through especially
when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy
and miss out on attending
the festival film award ceremony his film was entered into .
to see this character
who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating .
even at the end
when he makes one more attempt
to reach out to his father
was so ave. and as in real life ,
most father can never get past their wall
to reach out to their child .
i could even identify with giancarlo 
the other ,
who
while being the more self assured and elder other ,
had so many insecurity .
a really beautiful film
that made me laugh and cry .
