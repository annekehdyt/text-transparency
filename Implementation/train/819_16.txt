we saw this on the shelf at the local video store ,
saw `` coppola '' in the credit
and got excited .
that was the one
and only time this movie raised any interest .
i could never quite work out
if it was an attempt at a humourous film
that failed miserably 
or an attempt at a serious film
that failed miserably .
in general 
the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish .
the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful 
especially in the scene shot in the little bar ;
the dialogue was so corny in part it was unbelievable .
very disappointing .
