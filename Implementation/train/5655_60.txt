remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past
that does not quite meet those same feeling as an adult ?
that occurred to me
when i went back to school..the national lampoon 's class reunion .
the film has a perfect opportunity for laugh 
but surprisingly wander aimlessly
as we see a bizarre collection of character such a woman
who sold her soul to the devil
and can shoot out flame of fire from her mouth 
a man
who appears to be a vampire ,
and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wear sack over his head .
you have the class president
who believes
he is the best thing since sliced ead
( but as we see in the film ,
he is a coward and joke ) 
a couple of pot smoker
who do not even know
they are at their own class reunion ,
and a man
named gary for whom know one even knew existed
( and no one can seem to remember his name..this
is the one running joke i enjoyed ) .
there is a plump pervert
who likes to grab woman in inappropriate place 
a deaf and blind woman
who has a screeching holler
when calling for her dog 
and the cook
( you know her from `` goonie '' and `` throw mama from the train '' )
who loves to place food on person 's plate with her hand !
the film is essentially about a nutcase
who is
( or at least attempting to )
taking revenge on his classmate for a gag
they pulled on him
( they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister ! ) .
the film follows the character
as they search for the killer canvasing darkened 
trashed hallway of the old high school .
they were told of the killer by his psychologist
who seems a bit odd himself .
the film has a few good gag
that work
( pretty much early on ) ,
but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute .
the film 's true problem is that it really does not know where to go .
the film is pretty much a one-joke premise
for it has unassured direction..if
it really has any direction at all .
the cast is enthusiastic enough ,
but the material
they are to make funny
just
does not have the quality
to hold any interest .
it is a curio for fan of early 80 's comedy relic
that are forgotten
( this one rightfully so ) .
