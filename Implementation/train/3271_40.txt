as you probably already know ,
jess franco is one prolific guy .
hes made hundred upon hundred of film ,
many of which are crap .
however 
he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation .
`` succubus '' is not his best work
( thats either `` the diabolical dr. z '' or `` vampyros lesbos '' ) ,
but it has many of his trademark
that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog .
he combines the erotic
( alternating between showing full-frontal nudity
and leaving something left to the imagination )
and the surreal seamlessly .
this is a very dreamlike film 
full of great atmosphere .
i particularly liked the constant namedropping .
despite coming off
as being incredibly pretentious 
its amusing to hear all of franco 's influences.still ,
there are many user
who do not like `` succubus '' and i can see
where they are coming from .
its leisurely paced 
but i can deal with that .
more problematic is the incoherency .
the script here was obviously rushed ,
and within five minute into the film i had absolutely no idea
what was going on
( and it never really came together from that point on ) .
those
who want some substance with their style ,
look elsewhere .
also ,
if its a horror film ,
it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful .
still 
i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness
that i did not really mind these major flaw all too much .
( 7/10 )
