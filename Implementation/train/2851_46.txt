for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time .
no exception .
jame cameron has proved himself time and time again
that he is a master storyteller .
through film such as alien 
the abyss and both terminator it is clear
that he was a illiant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes .
he sees a story
and adds a strange quality to the film .
but titanic is so much different to his other stroke of illiance .
the film is exceptionally moving
and allows room for surprise 
plot development and interesting character development in a story
that everyone knows .
the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend
so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful 
interesting and entertaining film about it .
the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio
who plays jack and kate winslet
who plays rose became superstar overnight with the release of this film and in most film i get annoyed
when the supporting character are not given a lot to do but in this film
it is more purposeful
because as an elderly rose
( gloria stuart )
tells her story
it is quickly apparent
that it is rose 's and jack 's story alone 
no one else .
emotionally it is entirely satisfying
and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home .
the music has become iconic and legendary .
it is composer jame horner 's finest soundtrack ever
and evokes so much from the film and the audience .
the song after so long has become annoying
but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon
it is
and this film is .
only one problem 
the usual jame cameron problem 
is the dialogue
which is memorable but in a bad way
as in how cheesy it is at point
but all that aside .
jame cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic
that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime .
my heart will not go on from this one .
