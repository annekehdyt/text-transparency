i was shocked
and surprised by the negative review i saw on the web ,
i thought cinderella 2
( as well as 3 )
is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kid and adult ... like me 
i am 22 year old.i also find it and very informative film ,
it shows lesson on being true to yourself and following your heart .
i thought
it has great animation ,
and the voice casting was very good ;
the song
performed by brooke allison too .
since this film has been divided into three flashbacks/story 
my favorite out of the three 
is the story
of when jaq the mouse 
became a human for a day 
thank to fairy godmother and her magic .
