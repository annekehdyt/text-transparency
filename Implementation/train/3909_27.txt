i knew i was going to see this
when i saw the first preview .
dennis quaid was one reason ,
but the theme of holding on to your dream speaks to me .
person talk about this as a movie for kid ,
but i think
it is a movie for baby boomer
who are coming to term with aging 
infirm parent 
our own mortality 
our kid growing up
and leaving us ,
and all the other thing
we never thought
would happen to us .
the movie does not fall into the trap of tragedy ;
it is about what living your dream means
when you have a real life .
quaid is too small for a pitcher
but he makes it look good ,
and rachel griffith makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful 
layered performance .
the camera-work is slow and sweet .
when they put this movie together ,
they left out anything
that was not necessary .
very nice .
