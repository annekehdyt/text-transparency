tell the truth i \u2019 m a bit stun
to see all these positive review by so many person ,
which is also the main reason
why i actually decide to see this movie .
and after having seen it ,
i was really a disappointed ,
and this comes from the guy
that loves this genre of movie.i \u2019 m surprise at this movie
all completely \u2013
it is like a kid \u2019 s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason
and it all involve little child cursing and swearing .
i \u2019 m not at all righteous
but this has really gone too far in my account.synopsis :
the story about two guy got send to the big other program for their reckless behavior .
there they met up with one kid with boobs obsession
and the other is a medieval freak.just the name
it self is not really connected with the story at all .
they are not being a role model and or do anything
but to serve their time for what they have done .
the story is very predictable
( though expected )
and the humor is lame .
and haven \u2019 t we already seen the same character
( play by mc lovin \u2019 )
in so many other movie
( like sasquatch gang ? ) .
i think
i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.well the casting was alright
after all he is the one
that produce the screenplay .
and the acting is so-so as expected
when you \u2019 re watching this type of movie .
and the direction 
what do one expect ?
this is the same guy
who ought us wet hot american summer ,
and that movie also sucks .
but somehow he always managed to ing in some star
to attract his horrendous movie.anyway i
felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time .
only the naked scene seem to be the best part in the movie .
can \u2019 t really see any point
why i should recommend this to anyone.pros :
elizabeth bank ?
two topless scene.cons :
not funny 
dreadful story 
nudity and kid do not mix together.rating :
3.5/10
( grade :
f )
