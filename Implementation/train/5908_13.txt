this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored .
prince 's oscar for music was richly deserved
( many person do not know he won one ) .
i think
this is one of the best film
to watch as a couple late at night on dvd .
a great surprise :
prince does a fine job acting ,
and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera .
morris day 
wendy 
and lisa are good in their supporting role .
very cool landmark film .
