the shirley jackson novel 'the haunting of hill house ' is an atmospheric tale of terror ,
which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion .
the atmosphere is well set out ,
and the chill are staged well .
a haunting masterpiece.the 1963 chiller 'the haunting ' stay closely to the book ,
but also adds its own detail to the plot .
fortunately 
these are very few ,
and so the terror of the book and the chill are executed even better on the screen .
the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie .
excellent !
and then 
jan de bont made this .
in 1999 
the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas -
if you could call this a remake .
why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie
is a mystery in itself 
but for the moment 
lets look at the film itself.it starts off averagely ,
as most horror movie do .
the set
used for hill house
is beautiful ,
and oddly mysterious 
and for a few minute 
it seems
as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling .
and then 
the first scare comes :
a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman 's face
( dr. marrow 's assistant ) .
this is hilarious ,
and truth be told ,
it nearly had me in tears.from then on ,
the film just spiral downward .
the acting seems to become somewhat wooden
as the film goes on ,
with owen wilson 's character being particularly irritating
( so it is such a relief
when he is decapitated by the flue )
.the special effect practically make this movie 
,
which is a shame ,
because most of them are incredibly cheesy
and look very dated .
example of these are many ,
so i will not bother listing them.so 
all in all 
i 
along with hundred of other 
strongly recommend
that you watch the original chiller 
or 
as an alternative 
buy the novel by shirley jackson .
but please 
stay away from this .
and ,
if you do decide to watch this ,
watch it on the tv
( as a lot of the channel love
to screen this film ,
and not the original )
or rent it cheap ,
but please do not buy it ,
whatever you do .
do not waste your money ! final rating :
4/10
