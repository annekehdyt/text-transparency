wow 
i am a huge henry viii/tudor era fan and 
well ,
this was ... . interesting .
the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one .
and wow ... just wow .
i have seen bad acting before ,
but this reached new height .
when the actress
who played catherine
was umm.. crying ?
she wails and scream and i have to admit i rewinded many time ... many 
many time ... . funny 
funny stuff .
the only person
who even showed any slight sliver of talent
was the actress playing anne boleyn
( i might be prejudiced though ,
i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn ,
she was a really facinating woman ,
read up on her ,
it is worth it ! )
also 
i have read a lot about the tudor time period
and i think
that the character were not very acurately displayed ,
they were all very stereotypical .
only see this movie
if you are prepared to see a very important time period ,
and the important life of those involved turned into a laughing stock .
