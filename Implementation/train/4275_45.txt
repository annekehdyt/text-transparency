i saw this movie today
and i have to say ,
it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hour
before going to see it .
personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it ,
but it did totally change my idea .
the movie was in most case surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performance .
it was a story about a boy
who had a dream
and who did everything to reach it .
this really touched me and as a film ,
which is based on a true story ,
it convinced me .
a new school 
psycho headmaster and a young boy
who get
known with a new teacher 
a bit different one than the other and about fighting for the thing
even if they does not seem to work out .
it showed
how little thing can make huge change in many thing ,
and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situation .
also i think
the actor selection has succeeded perfectly .
it really felt
like you had been some person watching the episode as an outsider
when they happened .
before i spoil this movie with praise 
i have to admit
that there were some thing and situation
that did not look
and feel realistic..like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frit aka .
martin in front of the class 
at the end of the movie .
he really got beaten badly 
but the only thing
that it caused to him ,
was some blood coming from the nose
when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning ,
when frit got some stitches..well i guess
every movie has it own faults..have to say ,
that
if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store ,
it is sure thing ,
that i take it with me .
