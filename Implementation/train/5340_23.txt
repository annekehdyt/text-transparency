what a fun filled 
sexy movie !
they certainly do not make them like this anymore .
4 sexy au pair arrive in london
and have all sort of sexual misadventure .
the tone is oddly innocent ,
as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situation ,
rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the character .
it is only when the actress accidentally lose their clothe
that the male character become rampant .
richard o ' sullivan literally gets 'randi '
( sic ) .
the film certainly betrays the origin of the softcore feature
as lying in the nudie cutie and naturism film of the old school .
my special interest in 'au pair girl ' is that i am a huge fan of gaielle drake .
if any actress has ever looked better naked
( she is slim but wonderfully curvy ) 
or clothed 
come to that
( i have loved her since the original run of ufo -
who else could carry off a purple wig !
) 
i will eat my hat .
