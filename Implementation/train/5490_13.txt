anyone
who does not think
bill and ted 's bogus journey is one of the greatest movie of all time needs their head checked .
it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-ainer ,
but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time .
one of those rare film
that actually improves upon it predecessor ,
bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again .
notable highlight include the duel with death and the ending ,
which is highly `` emotional '' .
keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best 
ted theodore logan in bill and ted :
the return .
