sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right condition ,
but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival 
a scion of the genji clan .
the film-making has the main hallmark of a low-budget production ,
including blurry fight scene and clumsy montage
( the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama ) .
the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher
that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit
that guards gojoe idge at night ,
but he does not realize
that this decision will ing him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time -
but which could earn him enlightenment .
there is no absence of ambitiousness 
however 
in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly .
artsy flourish in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style .
a disappointment .
