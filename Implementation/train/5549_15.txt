this is a movie of tired 
yet weirdly childish 
clich\u00e9s .
there is a nazi witch master
performing sf-related experiment in the basement ?
oh please !
aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear ,
the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright .
not having any expectation beforehand ,
i am left with :
an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape-like face
who does not seem to know how to act .
said
adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable `` cannibal woman in the avocado jungle of death '' .camera
and editing adds to the general impression of lame .
