i watched this a few day ago ,
so detail are getting hazy .
the film is shot on hand-held camera ,
and a lot was made of this at the time
it was released originally ,
since we had not had many studio picture made in this way .
i can not help but feel
this was more of a gimmick than anything ,
designed to make the audience think
that what we are seeing on the screen
has not had all the compromise
that come with a big budget ,
and so was more `` real '' .
however what we have here is not much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket ,
so anyone
who has seen that 
or any one of the other rip offs there of 
will know what to expect.the main problem i had was the stereotyped character 
with the weedy soft kid out of their depth 
close harmony singing 
ebonic spouting black dude 
world weary sergeant 
bitter and twisted psychos etc etc ...
all being put into the sort of situation
that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time .
maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation ,
maybe it was laziness ,
or maybe it was just a committee
trying to appeal to the biggest audience ,
all i know is it was annoying .
one novel thing was the mixture of volunteer and draftee
( where normally all the character would have been forced into the situation 
)
although only the scene between the two main character really make much play of it .
this seems to be the main pivot of the plot ,
with the volunteer coming to their sense and the draftee gaining a sense of duty and self worth ,
but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way .
the other big bug i had was how all the character
( with the exception of the psychos and the real softie )
would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threat of violence ,
faced with farrell 's ubiquitous stoicism ,
immediately back down
and be all reasonable and diplomatic.i guess
if i had to find a plus
it would be the acting from the two lead ,
which was strong and very convincing ,
tho considering the formulaic nature of the character ,
this was not too hard.in my imagination ,
bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty ,
and for my money 
4 episode of that would be more fun to watch .
