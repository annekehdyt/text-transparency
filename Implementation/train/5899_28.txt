best animated movie ever made .
this film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely boggling effect 
but the anch of the human mind 
soul 
and philosophy .
the story features a family of cat ,
where in the big sister dy ,
the younger other see this and rescues her body ,
but when she awakens
she is left without a soul .
so 
the two sibling cat embark on a journey to find it .
i have related this journey to many thing .
the history of the world 
the bible 
the cycle of life 
and every time i watch it i discover more and more hidden theme and metaphor .
if you are not so into the physiological aspect of it then ,
you will still adore it .
the animation is superb ,
and the creative scene will have you attached to the screen .
for example 
the ocean freezing in time 
god eating soup out of the earth 
a strange and slightly snm retelling of hansel and gretel .
to conclude 
cat soup is an absolute treat for anyone.ps- not for kid ,
gratuitous violence included .
