i would like to say
that curiosity got the best of me .
if only i saw a trailer ,
i would be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie ;
i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minute in my entire life 
and about twenty dollar .
this movie was a disaster waiting to happen ,
and it is an embarrassment to hollywood.the movie
displays a vivid ignorance of reality .
for example 
this kid 's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood ,
and even enter this house .
it is even covered with clothe .
is it not rational
to believe
that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstance ?
hollywood obviously did not believe so .
common logic and any concept of electronic dictates the opposite ;
i doubt
the race car could even have reached the street ,
let alone a house across the street .
another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence
the criminal possess .
why is it in all these movie ,
these criminal are rocket scientist
until they encounter an eight-year old ?
the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorist ?
please 
there is more reality in the matrix .
also 
the leader puts down his real pistol and `` accidentally '' picks up a plastic pistol ;
apparently 
he could not tell the difference .
even with a glove on 
one should be able to do that .
just because they look the same does not mean anything ;
there is other sense then sight .
the trap are unrealistic as well ;
if any one of them actually worked ,
the criminal would be dead .
but 
hollywood intends for us to `` laugh '' at the `` funny ''
result of the trap .
i did not laugh ;
i sighed
and rolled my eyes.but 
i recommend this movie to anyone
who thinks
they have seen a really bad movie ;
the movie
they saw
will seem like citizen kane
compared to this one .
otherwise 
skip this one for the sake of your pride .
home alone 3 also raises a question .
we all know alex d. linz star in the movie ,
but did he write it as well ?
