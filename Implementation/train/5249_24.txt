brother with psychokinetic power
( yes 
really )
duel not just for dea winger 's affection but really over a secret from their childhood
that left them at odd over their power.there are surreal touch
( the fire igade
that act like a singing greek chorus ) ,
but there is also humour 
wit and romance .
the soundtrack is great also .
and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song
they could get ~ but with fire and i do not think
i will ever forget dennis quaid
( mmmmm dennis quaid ) ,
setting his own trailer a rockin ' too 'she is a lady ' ~ priceless ; )
best line missing from the quote section btw ~ 'once
you have had a clown ,
you never go back !
'i love this movie
( i just ordered the dvd from the us )
and if the comment
written by the kind of person
who 'd be happier with legally blond 3 do not put you off ~
give it a try : )
