worst bob hope comedy ever
( and that includes some heavy competition ) .
hope 
on an island with sailor 
dream aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl `` steering his ship '' .
somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff ,
as it features phyllis diller and gina lolloigida
and still can not work up any laugh or excitement .
where is bing crosby
when you really need him ?
