`` sky captain and the world of tomorrow ''
( an amazingly incovenient title )
is simply a bad movie ;
it has no heart 
no deep idea 
nothing very special about it .
yes 
the cgi backgrounds look interesting ,
but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus .
additionally 
the movie uses music the same way as 
say 
`` gilligan 's island '' or the scooby-doo cartoon
-- it never stops .
terribly 
simply terrible .
there are no fresh idea 
either 
just gobs and gobs and gobs and ...
etc. 
of bit taken from older movie and serial .
there is no gatekeeper here ,
the movie just seems to exist
because it can .
save your money and your time .
not entertaining at all .
