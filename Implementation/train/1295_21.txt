i got the dvd very cheap and i am a total drewbie ,
and thats probably the only constellation
where this movie could ever interest anyone.an early drew movie ,
she is looking great ,
and she gets a quite lot of really cute scene of her 
like a shower scene 
a sexy dance scene 
quite a number of sexy outfit etc .
she does never show
the friendly charm we know
from her more recent movies.the movie itself is pretty average or sub-average ,
and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema .
there is no real horror or tension built up
and the dialog are often cheesy.the most interesting part is probably the end
because i honestly do not understand it .
but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway .
but at least you do not get the end
you would be expecting ,
and it also comes much sooner
than one would have expected.overall i think
this movie is exclusively for drewby .
