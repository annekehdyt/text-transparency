this amazing oscar winner
( 4 in total )
and john ford 's first academy award winner 
is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner .
called an art film ,
because ford had very little money
to make this great story about guilt and retribution 
and greed and stupidity .
but what makes this movie such a classic ,
is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting ,
that was so different from the usual american film 
and more in the tradition of german expressionism .
and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable .
basically the movie takes place in ireland ,
and gypo turn in a friend in the rebel movement to the english
to collect 20 pound
to give to his girlfriend .
but having all that money ,
he starts blowing it on an all night drunk
and giving it away ,
while the leader of the movement are trying to track down the informer .
the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland 
and a cast of character
that are memorable but all along ,
the whole world of gypo is closing in on him 
both psychologically .
if i had to pick maybe three director
to have all their movie on a deserted island forever ,
and nobody else 
john ford would certainly be one of them .
what a truly remarkable movie ...
