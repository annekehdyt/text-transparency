i meant that in a good way ,
believe me .
true to life 
it are not .
the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick ,
but you do enjoy the cast here-flynn 
smith 
bond 
watson 
frawley 
etc .
all good .
i also liked
seeing mike mazurki-of course he played a boxer 
what else ?
typical forty flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scene 
one
after the other.flynn is fine as gentleman jim ,
you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here 
i suppose ,
but it is okay ,
it is a cartoon
and meant to please ,
that is all .
the boxing scene were pretty good 
ward bond 's vaudeville logging act a riot ,
and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobby come racing into the scene a couple of times.really alotta fun ,
flynn was on a roll at that time
and it is clear to see why audience loved him .
