all day now i have been watching dinoaur ,
and all day they have had the same fundamantal problem.they do not believe in firearm .
they just do not seem to have been _told_ about them or something .
bullet _bounce_ off of dinoaur !
maybe it is because they became extinct million of year before the invention of gunpowder ,
and the law of physic were just different back then ... aah 
no .
come on .
if they are close enough to chemically operate today ,
they had have to be vulnerable to fast
( even subsonic )
lead projectile .
it is that simple.look 
the toughest-skinned reptile on the planet today 
alligator and crocodile 
are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire .
they are nothing magic .
you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scale on their back .
they do not take armor-piercing bullet or anything special .
small bullet penetrate them 
they just do not kill them .
somewhat ( but not really )
large bullet are preferred
because the challenge
( as with most game )
is to kill the animal with one shot ,
so it does not run .
( hunter consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested .
)
most animal ,
including predator ,
are easily repelled by gunfire .
between the noise 
and the pain of even a non-lethal wound 
most will run away .
an exception are big bear ,
which are so fearless
that they are merely enraged by mortal wound .
cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous
because they are well known to charge when wounded .
we have seen video of the big bull of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lion .
a big cat will run
if it can ,
but if it can not it will charge as a final act of desperation .
where a t.rex would fit in this spectrum
is unknown .
their behavior simply has not been observed .
with these larger animal 
safe hunting becomes a matter
of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile ,
and/or
applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge .
with a t.rex 
of course 
this could be a serious problem .
i have seen a t.rex skull
( they have one in the museum downtown )
and carrying a gun big enough to bust
that might be impractical .
chewing its neck off with lot of smaller fire might be a more viable approach .
small bullet would still _penetrate_ them ,
they would not just bounce off
just because the animal is too big
to easily kill !
so here we have cortez and his man
( this is _before_ the famous mexican campaign ,
apparently )
captured by american native
and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid .
it appears
that all those human sacrifice were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t.rex
that terrorized the continent in the day .
rather than just having their heart cut out
and being fed to the lizard ,
cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt
and kill them .
ok 
maybe they do not have m-16 like the guy in the `` carnosaur '' series ,
but they _do_ have flintlock 
crossbow ,
pointed stick
( big one ,
made from tree )
and sword .
maybe
that is a little less uneven than squad of soldier with full auto ,
but they have several guy
and i would quickly bet on them over a dinoaur .
oh 
wait 
there is a _cannon_ 
about a 4-incher .
that is just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus ' skull !
so they lay a trap ,
with a squad of man 
cannon 
pointed stick in a ravine ,
and lure the first t.rex into it ,
using a pretty own girl as bait .
cortez point out
that they will not have time to reload ,
so they will have to close the range
until they can be certain of their aim .
t.rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire ,
and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off !
forget it .
end of credibility .
a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez ' torso armor ,
and a 4 '' cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship !
this would also _certainly_ get through the hide 
ribcage 
or skull of any animal
ever to walk this planet .
( do you think
a _whale_ could withstand a 4 '' cannon ball ? )
and here is t.rex ,
still standing 
not even bleeding .
so cortez lure it to the ravine ,
where it falls onto the pointed stick ,
which
( i guess by magic )
penetrate it
and kill it .
yaaay 
pointed stick !
the dino are not completely invulnerable to gunfire -
they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol .
this runs it off ,
so it is not as mean as a bear or a buffalo 
at least in the movies.they kill the second dinoaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstone .
my money would still be on the cannon .
it is engineered function
is to concentrate all the gunpowder 's energy in one direction - toward the target .
a bomb is a much more diffused application of force .
a _real_ bomb
( not a gourd bomb )
has a steel casing
which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure .
( think :
pipe bomb vs firecracker . )
a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof .
( trust me on that one . )
