this movie was my first touch with mr sica
so i really did not know what to expect .
but what i saw just oke all my expectation - in a good way.the storyline is not complex
and shows us a life of found boy- orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor person
who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate house .
this little city in another city lives own life and thing are going fine .
but one day there is a water resource
found and a rich noble man is getting interested in the buying the place .
but as the title of the movie hints - there is a miracle taking place .
our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother .
what is he going to do to protect his friend and all built city as well ?
it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy .
there is shown the behavior of poor person
and how money and property can talk and play with person .
also many funny moment and scene are included - at the beginning with the spot
where sun is shining and many more.so according to the fact
that i m not a comedy lover
you should see this movie
because i liked it much i
