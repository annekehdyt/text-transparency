other commentator have detailed the plot and the social parable and commentary as well
( or better )
that i could ,
but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film .
it holds up very well indeed more
that 50 year later in every category - screenplay ,
acting 
photography 
set design 
sound design ...
it really is a classic of sort .
this was my first exposure to the `` young '' alec guinness ,
and it is obvious from the first frames what made him so special
as to eventually receive a knighthood .
i only rate it an `` 8 ''
because it is essentially a rather lightweight parable
that examines human nature but does not really skewer it ;
and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end ,
rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill worker and industrialist
who are chasing him all over town .
also 
a couple minute of thought reveal the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear
and tear is hardly ever the determining factor
in buying new clothe
( especially dress clothe ) ;
child grow up ,
person change size 
gain and lose weight ,
and go with the latest fashion all the time ,
and have as long as loom have woven cloth .
and if nothing else 
the manufacturer would make a fortune
providing indestructible material for military uniform
( especially bdus ) .
still 
this is a great film .
if you get a chance
to see it on a classic movie channel ,
you should .
