i tried to watch this movie three separate time .
the night i rented it .
got through about 20 minute hoping
it would be better
if i had a night 's rest .
watched 15 more the next day ,
almost vomited at how stupid it was ...
it was not even funny stupid
which is sometime a fun movie
to watch
but this movie was just crap with a capital s
( if you know
what i mean in the censored world we live in ) .
and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing
and i did not enjoy one single moment !
not even one .
how did this script get greenlighted .
oh boy ! g1/10 -
the one is for cheerleader ...
they deserve at least something for all their hardwork .
