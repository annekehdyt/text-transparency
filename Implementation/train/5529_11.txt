an enjoyable batman animated film .
not on par with `` return of the joker '' or `` mask of the phantasm '' 
but solid nonetheless .
i liked
how the movie kept you guessing
as to who batwoman was .
there was nice twist .
nice action sequence .
i have always been of the opinion
that the batman cartoon are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequel .
the trend continues here.7.5/10
