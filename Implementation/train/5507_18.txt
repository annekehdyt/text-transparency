why me ?
why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot ? !
at least if i can warn other person off ,
it will have been worthwhile.i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course .
otherwise 
i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear .
the movie was slow ,
had painfully little character development ,
and centered around the idea
that a creepy little white man can become cool
if he hangs out with an la-style token black man.if
you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling
of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie .
note 
though ,
that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an `` la lifestyle '' ,
it is a wonderful example of the product
that arise from it .
