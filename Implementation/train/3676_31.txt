when 'my deja vu 
my deja vu ' aired last season 
i was pleased .
scrubs 
i thought ,
is doing something clever and unique in regard to the clip-show concept .
instead of replaying footage 
they are replaying joke in a self-aware manner ,
and i really enjoyed it.i found
it really unfortunate
that i was wrong .
one season later 
they succumbed to that
which almost all sitcom inevitably do ,
the clip show ...
and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid .
dr cox 's shaved head shows just how lazy the editor were in putting it together ,
as it does not appear again until 'my long goodbye ' some 4 episode later .
i can not imagine
that a wig is too much effort
when it comes
to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom .
who knows
why it was slotted there ,
it just seemed lazy and out of place ,
reminding me
( largely )
of episode
that have aired within the past year.three second clip jammed together with background music
is a dvd extra for a ( very ) rainy day 
not an episode of prime-time television .
