-=contain spoiler from both original and movie versions=-i am a huge fan of notre dame de paris musical ,
i also read book this summer and i watched movie today ,
in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film
especially when i saw 6.3 imdb point.first scene were good
but i actually waited for 
theater scene directly from book ,
but it was normal
but when esmeralda kiss gringoire i felt something
is wrong..they do not even kiss in book ,
even in musical..and there were huge gap
why esmeralda being judged by sorcerer ,
in the book she teaches her goat how to respond number of clock or write word `` phoebus '' .. wait
there were a phoebus
were not there ?
in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more ,
the creator made quasimodo 's love
to show around
and they even canceled frollo 's love..but notre dame was frollo .
his thought his struggle between love of god and love of human in movie we can not find anything like that all we have is 
some villain
who is really bad and kills person
whose clash with his thought..and
not mentioning phoebus ,
not mentioning love of frollo ,
not mentioning jehan
( other of frollo )
not mentioning mother of esmeralda
( maybe it is ok ,
the storyline would have chopped much )
they even not mentioned the real story..
( another ps :
frollo was not a opus dei or some cult member
he actually in interest with alchemy
he tries to make gold..he
was stuck in science and religion )
finally do not watch this movie ,
it is some kind of director edition to real masterpiece ,
and
if you have watched it before read the book ,
god have mercy on you..you must read to book immediately..this movie is worse than hunchback of notre dame ii the animated movie ,
spend your time with watching notre dame de paris musical.. enough said..
