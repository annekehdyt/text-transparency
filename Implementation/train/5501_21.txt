this movie is flawed on many front .
like many before it 
it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history .
the production is poor ,
overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lot of actor
who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood square .
this to me was the greatest flaw -
i know
the age and general personality of the real alamo protagonist and the geriatric ensemble of tv actor
chosen to portray them
never let any hint of believability intrude.as a native texan ,
i grew up with the mythology .
i later learned more about the history .
i can accept a decent production from either perspective
( although i prefer more historical accuracy ) ,
but this never gave me a chance
to enjoy it .
even john wayne 's or fess parker 's version had more life than this stolid mess ,
while being only slightly less accurate.very disappointing
-
avoid it .
