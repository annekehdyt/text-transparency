the only good thing about `` person i know ''
is that it serves as a perfect example of movie
that al pacino should avoid performing in .
the first big turn-off i had was the way
in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent ;
at time it was weak and unattractive
while in other segment it seemed too overdone .
dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot .
the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job
in keeping the movie interesting ,
and within an hour i still saw no sign of a sturdy plot .
the story overall is a real bore ,
and i had to slap myself in the face a few time
to keep myself
awake.this movie will surely bore you as well ... avoid at all cost .
