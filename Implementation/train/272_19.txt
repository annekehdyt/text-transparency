prominent attorney walter pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono ,
wins an acquittal
and discover
that his client
( keefe braselle )
was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring
reaching to the highest eschelon of the city .
panged by his own complicity ,
he undertakes an investigation ,
stumbles onto the identity of the `` unknown man ''
who heads the syndicate ,
and murder him.the irony engage
when braselle is charged with this second murder and pidgeon
must defend him
by pointing to the existence of another `` unknown man ''
-- himself .
though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric 
the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of american municipal politic
that came to light in the postwar year .
