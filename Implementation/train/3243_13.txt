strangely 
this version of open your eye is more mature and more nuanced .
aided by hindsight ,
crowe 's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabar 's original .
the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first ,
but there is no doubt
that crowe has improved on it
-- if just slightly .
notice
that you have no idea
what the lead did in open your eye ,
but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky .
that is what i mean by more `` fleshed out . ''
