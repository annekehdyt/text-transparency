it is movie like these
that make you wish
that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school .
if you liked this movie ,
then i would suggest you watch valentine .
i just found out today
that the guy
who played marty
( simon )
killed himself a little after
the movie was released
which is a shame
since he did a good job .
i wonder
if it is because of the part he
played in the movie .
it starts out
when carol tricks him into going into the girl restroom to act like they were about to do it .
when he was changing in the shower ,
carol popular friend snuck into the bathroom
and got everything ready 
camera 
electric shock 
pole .
when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized
that he was tricked .
he tries to cover the shower up
but the kid open it 
grab marty and starts being mean to him
while the camera is rolling .
they picked him up 
dunked his head in the toliet
while it was being flushed ,
and they electricuted him ( slightly ) .
when the kid are in detention ,
given by the coach 
2 of the boy give marty a joint
that will make him throw up .
skip eaks one of the glass windows in the gym
using a ick
to get the teacher
to excuse him .
while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff
that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was .
the lab blows up disfiguring him badly .
5 year later the kid
who tormented him
that day got invitation for a 5 year school reunion at the old school
which was burn that day it exploded .
one by one the person get killed off .
i do not understand how the girl
who drowned
really drowned .
she could have gotten back up after marty left .
she almost got out the first time .
