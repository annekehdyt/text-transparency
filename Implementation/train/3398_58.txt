`` let 's bowl '' started out on local television in the twin city .
it came on late at night ,
something you would stumble across
while channel surfing
after your 7th bottle of hamm's.even the ad were locally produced ,
featuring wally outside grumpy 's bar ,
holding a microphone and stammering nervously
-- `` ahh ... over to you 
steve sedahl . ''
not sure why ,
but that one always made me laugh.there was a bowling contest featured under the guise
of settling a dispute between two bowler ,
but the game was secondary to the commentary and clip .
sedahl played it straight 
counter-balanced by rich kronfeld 's bizarre and hilarious `` wally hotvedt . ''
highlight included segment like `` how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball ''
( chuck them into a lake )
and `` tip on dating 
''
where the duo `` date '' a couple of hooker and wally ends with the bitter complaint ,
`` i could have done that myself ! ''
another segment
-- what the duo did on their day off --
featured steve in beer can strewn hovel 
pigging out from the fridge
while wally struggled to climb the cliff at taylor 's fall ,
dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphone .
hilarious !
wally 's awestruck comment about `` league bowler 
'' and his struggle
to apply the correct euphemism to various split
were also highlight .
`` let 's bowl '' was picked up by comedy central
and had some good moment ,
but the network never really knew what to do with it ,
running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling `` competition 
''
which was never the point of the show .
the constant commercial interrupted the flow and the side character
( ernie 
the pig 
butch 
etc . )
were more distraction than anything else .
the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced .
even jon stewart dissed let 's bowl on the daily show
-- ( not enough lame 
snide joke ? )
-- an ignominious treatment for a show
that deserved far better.how often does a `` let 's bowl '' come along in the world of modern television 
a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap ?
the network have the `` total crap '' part down cold ,
but it is a sad thing
to watch them kill such a dark 
strange 
funny little gem like `` let 's bowl . ''
here is hoping
they will put it out on dvd .
