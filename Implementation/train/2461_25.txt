to be utally honest ...
i loved watching severed .
that is why igave it a 1/10 star
because of its starkly unimaginativestory/filming/acting/everything .
this film was a riot to watch .
ifyou enjoy watching bad film
in order to poke fun at them ,
you willreally get a kick out of severed.the story really does not matter ,
it involves some guy
who 's baldand has a sword
and goes around beheading random person .
but he has a supernatural twist ...
nobody ever sees him do it .
even when 
in one very memorable scene 
he walks into ajampacked night club
and whack off some girl 's noodle andnobody sees it .
severed does not merely look like
it was filmed on video- it wasfilmed on someone 's home camcorder .
the filmmaker hadknowledge of lighting
( very thin knowledge )
and compositionactually holds together in some scene .
but mostly you can not hearthe actor ... you can not understand what they are doing ,
and you laughwhen the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body.go and rent this movie .
support film like this- they are a hoot anda hollar !
