well ... ... .in contrast to other comment
previously written i
have to say
that the only good thing about this film is the fact
that one guy in it looked a bit like jason donavon
which reminded me of my youth .
i have no idea
how it won any award ,
and although i am sure a great deal of effort went into making
it it was all fruitless
as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90 's foreign soap opera .
the plot was non-existent ,
the cinematography was hopeless
and the acting was on par with an a-level performance .
it was unfortunately long
and the sub-plot were incredibly unrealistic ... .for
example ... .if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 year
after only 2 week of being oken up
you would not all remain the best of friend .
it was all fantasy .
that is all !
oh yeah 
and the weird 90 's house/soft core indie was mind numbing !
