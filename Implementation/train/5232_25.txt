this is a very difficult movie ,
and it is almost impossible to get a handle
on what is going on .
at first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy
( trelkovsky )
who needs an apartment
and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant
( a woman )
commits suicide .
then the twist and turns start .
are the neighbor trying to kill him ?
and why are the dead tenant 's clothe turning up in the apartment ?
one wonder 
finally 
if trelkovksy _is_ the prior tenant .
spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler one of the trick polanski pull on us is to lie to us .
we assume
when we see thing from the point of view of a character
that we see thing as the character does
and that there may be distortion of reality .
we assume
when the camera is showing us thing from its omniscient point of view
that we see actuality -
but polanski has the camera lie
to us .
