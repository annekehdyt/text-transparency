marium bello does not seem to care what person think of her choice in movie role .
again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in .
maybe she needs those movie ,
to get off the sugar coated
( aka `` hollywood '' )
one
she does here
and then
( coyote ugly and of course mummy 3 )
.while i think fail
to achieve what it sets out to do
( i will not spoil that ) ,
marium bello is as great as in her other independent/small movie
she stars in .
it is her performance
that elevates this movie .
this
combined with the strange subject matter
almost did the trick for me .
but in the end
( and even if i try to overlook some flaw 
like bad pacing and dramaturgy ) ,
the movie is still too long
