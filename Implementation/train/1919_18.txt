documentary of this kind are often very opinionated .
this film seems to take all opinion out
and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided .
it is sad the condition
these poor person have to work in ,
this film does a great job
of showing the ugly side of sweat shop .
the film mardi gras :
made in china was a good way
of showing the world how something
as petty as bead for a celeation can effect the life of so many person in another country.i had to watch this film for an english class
where we spent our time
talking about sweat shop
and how some person are trying to eliminate them
and this film helped get the topic rolling .
it was a great ,
very informative movie and i would recommend anyone see it ,
it kinda opens your eye .
