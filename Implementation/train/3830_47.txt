zodiac killer .
1/10 .
worst acting ever .
no really worst acting ever .
david hess
( last house on the left .
no the one from the seventy .
rent
it it is really good )
is the worst of the bunch
( pretty stiff competition
but he is amazingly god-awful . )
one would be hard pressed
to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence .
the film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt
when he is on the screen.not
that the film actually has any redeeming quality for mr. hess to ruin .
it is filmed with a home movie camera
and by the look of thing a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike .
no post production either .
come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer
could use
that could clean up this picture .
throw in bizarre stock footage picture of autopsy 's and aircraft carrier takeoff
and this is one visually screwed up picture .
the autopsy picture are interjected the way
italian cannibal film interject those god-awful real life animal killing .
and the navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement
( cause
we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the navy )
what in the world is lion 's gate is doing releasing this garbage ?
it would embarrass troma .
the plot is about the zodiac killer
( last seen in dirty harry .
no the one from the seventy .
rent it it is really good )
somebody gets shot in the stomach in la
and the cop assume
the zodiac killer is back ?
uh-huh .
what can you expect from a movie
that does not know
that dsm iv is a book not a psychiatric disorder
and where the young killer older man relationship resembles
that of a congressional page and closeted congressman ?
yeah eighty haircut and production value meet a nambla subplot .
sign me up .
