this is almost the worst film
you will ever see !
2012 doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one 
for me .
the prop are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis . '
it looks
as if the space scene were made in a 1950s power station ,
just prior to demolition .
the music really sucks .
the acting is wooden and ham .
the character
they portray
are shallow and unconvincing .
the plot is predictable .
it is immediately and azenly obvious
when they copy technique
and idea from other film .
the quality of direction beggar belief.but you have to see it ,
if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest waste of a tiny budget ever .
this is a priceless example of a stupid movie !
