i am a christian
who generally believes in the theology taught in left behind .
that being said ,
i think
left behind is one of the worst film i
have seen in some time.to
have a good movie ,
you need to have a well-written screenplay .
left behind fell woefully short on this .
for one thing 
it radically deviates from the book .
sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film ,
but in this film i saw change
that made no sense whatsoever.another thing ,
there is zero character development .
when character in the story get saved
( i will not say who ) ,
the book makes it clear
that it is a long 
soul-searching process .
in the film it is quick and artificial .
the book is written decently enough
where person like rayford steele 
buck william and hattie durham seem real ,
but in the movie scenario are consistently given the quick treatment
without anything substantial .
in another scene
where one character gets angry about being left behind
( again ,
i will not say
who ) ,
it seems artificial.i realize as a christian
it is unedifying for me to say
i disliked this film ,
but i can not in a good conscience recommend a film
that i feel was horribly done .
perhaps it would 've been better to make the first book into 2-3 film .
either way 
christian need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmaker ,
we need to start
by putting together a film in a quality way .
i realize a lot of effort
probably went into left behind ,
but that is the way i see it .
