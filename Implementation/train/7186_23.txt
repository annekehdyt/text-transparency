wow !
so much fun !
probably a bit much for normal american kid ,
and really it is a stretch to call this a kid 's film ,
this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandit
- very terry gilliam all the way through .
while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward ,
miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moment .
the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene
to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero 
with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein .
and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect
that are common of miike 's work ,
the layer of meaning and metaphor 
particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly 
is pretty damn poignant .
as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike film 
only instead of over the top torture and gore ,
he gives us an endless amount of monster and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively
conceived via cg
and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure .
f'n rad 
and one of miike 's best !
