robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e. lee ,
according the imdb.com movie database .
after seeing this film ,
you may think
duvall 's appearance is reincarnation at it is best .
one of my most favorite film .
i wish the composer ,
peter rodger melnick had a cd
or there was a soundtrack available .
wonderful scenery and music and `` all too-true-to-life 
'' especially for those of us
that live in ,
or have moved to 
the south .
this is a `` real moment in time . ''
life move on 
slowly ,
but `` stranger we do not remain . ''
