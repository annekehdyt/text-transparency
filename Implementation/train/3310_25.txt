i could not help but think of behind the mask :
the rise of leslie vernon
( a massively more amazing film )
when watching this
because of the realistic feel
to it as well as the great innovative idea .
this could have been a great film .
the acting is ... from some of the actor alright .
from other ... it is downright horrible.that aside
the idea is great
and the format is great .
the story is pretty good as well ,
though suffering often from big blow to the logical mind.nevermind
that though right ?
it is a horror movie
after all.i really want to see this remade ...
i really want it to be the fantastic film
that it wants to be.however
( and you can not really fault the mind behind the movie for this )
this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget .
and the fx really hurt the film overall.great movie .
...
if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx.whoever wrote
it should keep going though 
great idea here .
