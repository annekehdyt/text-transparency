the one and only season has just aired here in australia
and i thought
it was absolutely illiant !
i love it !
all the story line are so good !
and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today .
yet it still kept strong family value of sticking together
and being there for each other .
their problem were real ,
and it really drew you into the show .
the show is basically about this family
called 'the day ' and their life .
the family consisted of abby day
( mum ) ,
jack day
( dad ) ,
natalie day
( sporty daughter ) ,
cooper day
( outsider son ) ,
and nathan day
( boy genius son ) .
each episodes a day of their life 
with cooper perspective on thing throughout it .
i loved cooper his insight through out
the show was just great .
he was by far my favorite character .
it ended with so many thing
it could have continued with ,
i am really sad another season was not made .
it was a great show i
am gon na miss it .
