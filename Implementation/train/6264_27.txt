a previous reviewer said
the movie is not all that bad .
what ? ! ? ! ? !
the movie glorify child molestation .
oh 
but sylvia kristel was naked in it ,
so let 's give it 5/10 star .
why not a full 10 ?
because the filmography was `` agonizing 
''
the child 's look of shock were `` unrealistic 
''
and the fat friend was `` irritating . ''
nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage
that an american movie in 1981 featured scene of a child
having sex with a grown woman .
i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie
while staying at a hotel
that had showtime .
to me ,
even if the fat friend had acted up a storm
and was a deserving of an oscar ,
i would still have to give the movie only 1 star .
that tv 's howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time
as he was appearing in wkrp
is particularly ridiculous .
but do not take my word for it !
