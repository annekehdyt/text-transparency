'i am working for a sinister corporation
doing industrial espionage in the future and i am
starting to get confused about who i really am 
sh* # t !
i have got a headache
and thing are going wobbly ,
oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significan not yet cryptic image ... 'i rented this movie
because the few review out there have all been favourable .
why ?
cypher is a cheap 
derivative 
dull movie ,
set in a poorly realised bland futureworld 
with wooden lead 
and a laughable ending.an eerie sense
that something interesting might be about to happen
keep you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing event ,
before the film maker slap you in the face with an ending
that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran video.it is painfully obvious
they have eked out the production using dr
who style improvised special effect
in order to include a few good
( if a little babylon 5 ) cgi set piece .
this sub fight club 
sub philip k dick future noir thriller strife for a much oader scope
than its modest budget will allow.cool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb .
this is not intelligent sci-fi ,
this is the plot of a computer game .
