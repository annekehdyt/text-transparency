the reason i intended to give this movie a chance
to take 2 hour of my life
( actually it was only 35 minute )
was my wish
to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema .
all i have ever seen were few older movie of s.ray.browsing through imdb i came across this one
and after seeing rating of 8.7 i concluded this must be the one
which will open the door of unknown and ing artistic enjoyment .
oh my how wrong i was !
the only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 person
who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production
were adam sandler movie.with this rating
this movie would be ranked on 9th place on imdb list of 250 best movie above citizen cane 
goodfellas of psycho !
i am really not in a mood to review and criticize
because there is simply nothing
that i find worth remembering from this painful experience .
my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu
who like me find this movie as is
-- plain stupid 
with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .
