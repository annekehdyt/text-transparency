a couple move into their dream home 
unaware
that it and its neighbour have been built over land
formerly used as a cemetery .
the film is said to have been based on a true story ,
although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed .
the plot is hardly unique - see spielberg 's 'poltergeist '
( 1982 ) .
within a short time 
they experience various supernatural phenomena :
these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadow 
the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilet continually flushing
and garage door going out of control .
there is little depth to the story :
once it has become established
that the land had been used as a cemetery ,
we do not learn anything more .
the plot does not seem to develop .
the character are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable ,
nor is the atmosphere particularly special .
the film could be disturbing to some viewer .
there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it .
