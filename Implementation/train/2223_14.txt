if movie like ghouly rip off gremlin ,
then hobgoblin sink to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghouly .
these barely-animated furby have some kind of scheme
to fulfill fantasy
( which involve basically groteque character ' sex dream - oh joy ) ,
but what that has to do with anything
is anybody 's guess ,
except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica .
they show this down in the 8th circle of hell 
one suspect .
there is no real plot -
just `` goblin - kill ! ''
and feeble attempt at humor and a mild attempt
to arouse the viewing audience .
