`` painting is seeing ,
then remembering better than you saw . ''
so says
dick heldar
( ronald colman ) ,
the painter in the light
that failed.the movie is in the grand old hollywood style ,
starring ronald colman and a avura
supporting cast
that includes ida lupino in her first important role 
dependable character actor dudley digge
( who also co-starred with colman in condemned .
) ,
and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston.the title and opening sequence of the film pretty much give away the fact
that dick will lose his sight .
he is blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie
( muriel angelus )
are playing with a pistol .
later a wound
while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness .
he becomes a famous painter ,
but he is already blinded by ambition ,
and does not really reach his full potential until the point
that his sight is leaving him .
enter bad girl bessie
( ida lupino ) ,
and his self destruction is set in motion .
lupino is very powerful in this role
and plays off colman very well .
her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage .
well acted and well directed 
this is one of my favorite colman melodramas .
