god 
i am so sick of the crap
that comes out of america
called `` cartoon '' !
since anime became popular 
the usa animator
either produce a cartoon with a 5-year-old-lazy-ass style of drawing
( kappa mikey )
or some cheep japanese animation rip-off .
( usually messing up classic character )
no wonder anime is beating american cartoon !
they are not even trying anymore !
oh 
i just heard of this last night ;
i live in the uk
and when i found out this show first came out in 2005 
well ,
i never knew
the uk was so up-to-date with current show .
