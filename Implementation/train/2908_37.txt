i always have a bit of distrust
before watching the british period film
because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplay
( such as the one of 
for example 
vanity fair or the other boleyn girl ) ,
but with a magnificent production design 
european landscape and those thick british accent
which make the movie to suggest artistic value
which they do not really have.fortunately ,
the excellent film the young victorium does not fall on that situation ,
and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation
because of its fascinating story 
the excellent performance from emily blunt 
paul bettany and jim broadbent 
and the costume and location
which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.and i
say
`` unexpectedly ''
because i usually do not pay too much attention to those detail .
`` victoriumn era '' was ( in my humble opinion )
one of the key point in contemporary civilization 
and not only on the social aspect ,
but also in the scientific 
artistic and cultural one.but i honetly did not know about the origin from that era very much ,
and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic event
which prepared the landing of modern era
so much.i also liked the way
in which queen victorium is portrayed ,
which is as a young and intelligent monarch
whose decision were not always good 
but they were at least inspired by good intentions.i also found the depiction of the romance between victorium and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellect as well as in the emotion it evokes.the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clich\u00e9s of the romantic cinema on the love story ,
something
which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.i liked the young victorium very much ,
and i really took a very nice surprise with it.i hope more period film follow the example of this movie :
the costume and the landscape should work as the support of an interesting story ,
and not as the replacement of it .
