what do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star
who was involved in drug and murder ,
and then died of aid ?
you make a movie 
of course .
the probable reason
why it was not made earlier
is the fact
that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production .
so it is no coincidence
that the film was made just a little while
after nash was sent to prison.the best thing
about the movie is its quick pace .
there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap .
and why would it be ?
there is too much good material here
to require dull filler scenes.the cast is good .
kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movie ,
so here was finally a role quite suitable for him .
bosworth is cute so it is irrelevant how she acts
( she is solid ) ,
and mcdermott ,
who is otherwise quite annoying ,
is rather good 
to a large extent
because he is wearing so much facial hair
that i did not recognize him at first .
( i wish
they did that to cruise in every movie so i would not have to watch his dumb face . )
i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate ,
and would not have known
she was in it ,
had i not seen her name in the end-credit .
kudrow is charming as ever 
a bit unusual
to see her in a dramatic role .
( btw 
`` friend '' is the worst tv sitcom of all time . )
the only casting choice
that were questionable
were an early near-cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo .
you thought
i would include paris hilton 
too ,
did not you ?
no ,
i think
hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore .
because the film is about decadence 
among other thing \u0096 and about a porn actor \u0096
she fits in perfectly .
