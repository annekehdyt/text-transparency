in `` die nibelungen :
siegfried '' 
siegfried was betrayed .
now 
kriemhild seeks revenge .
she marries hagen ,
and through a series of event 
finally engages in a very drastic
( but fitting )
action at the end.one of the thing
about watching this movie nowadays
is that we can look at certain portrayal .
attila the hun
( called etzel in the movie )
is shown as the strange person from the east 
possibly an allusion to the soviet union .
obviously 
it was not fritz lang 's fault
that hitler used `` the nibelungenlied '' for german national pride in the third reich ,
but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story .
nonetheless 
this is an absolutely formidable movie .
