kurt russell is elvis 
plain and simple .
his dedication to this role
resulted in what i think ,
is the best movie bio ever .
if you are an elvis fan ,
see it
if you can.the made-for-television film was made two year after elvis ' death.one piece of advice ,
there are two version - one at 180 minute and one at 117 minute .
the only one to watch is the longer one .
the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out .
it just does not work
because the scene in it are often dependent on the scene
that were cut.this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment 's greatest star .
shelley winter and bing russell
( kurt 's real dad )
are excellent as elvis ' parent .
and pat hingle deliver a very competent col. tom parker.long live the king !
