it seems like this is the only film
that john saxon ever directed ,
and that he had the good sense
to stop after that and stay in front of the camera .
this movie is a dog ,
from start to finish ,
and it is dull
and wooden with nothing much going for it .
a viet nam war hero takes a job
working for a mob boss ,
gets a bit too friendly with the wife
and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself and the war hero framed
and sent to prison ,
death row 
specifically .
now 
this particular prison has been experimanting on inmate
and is testing some formula
that will turn man into the ultimate killing machine
( a zombie ) .
of course 
everything goes wrong
and then there is all these infected person trapped in the prison ,
some of whom are turning into zombie and the rest
who suddenly just do not want to be there anymore .
this just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much
to show
or say for itself ,
and i stopped it before the end ,
which seemed like
it was coming a few time but no ,
it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path .
if one watched to the end
they may well become a zombie themselves ,
so do not risk it .
2/10 .
