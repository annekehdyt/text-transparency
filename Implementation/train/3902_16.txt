this is easily a 9. michel serrault ,
known more for comic role in the earlier part of his acting career ,
does a stunning 
even worryingly stunning job of impersonating dr petiot 
a legendary french serial killer.he is just so believable at every and any moment in the film ,
that the actor completely disappears behind the character -
only the very best ever achieve this feat ,
and
when they do it is only in a handful of part at best.the whole story
( a real story
which happened in 20th century france )
is so powerful ,
so sinister -
it makes for a very strong film
that one remember for a long 
long time .
