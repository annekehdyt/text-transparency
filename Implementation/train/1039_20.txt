stefan is an x-con
that five year ago got married to marie .
their marriage has been stable until stefan past catch up with them
and he is offered to do a courier job .
stefan 's job is a heroin delivery from germany to sweden
which should go easily.in germany stefan meet elli 
a girl from bosnia
that has been sold to a stripclub owner .
stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help elli out of her misery .
due to the fact
that elli 's father during the war fleed to sweden elli now goes with stefan to sweden .
to make up with the past stefan promise elli
to help her find her father ,
no matter what it takes .
finally back in sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than stefan ever thought
of..this movie does not seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movie due to the fact
that it is been americanized alot .
regina lund and cecilia bergqvist makes it all average ,
the effect makes the movie a little too much though .
see it and jugde for yourself .
