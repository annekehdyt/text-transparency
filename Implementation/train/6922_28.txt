overlong drama
that is not capable of making any real point .
so she became an actress - so what ?
she learned to love - big deal .
there is a certain eccentricity among the character and in the dialog and situation ,
but the kind which is bad for the movie ,
causing it to often seem absurd.summer phoenix ,
playing the lead 
talk and behave like a semi-retarded person ,
so there is no choice
but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl
that makes it in the world of theater -
which was clearly not the intended point .
we are told early on ( in that `` barry lyndon '' -like narration )
that she learned to hide her emotion ,
which certainly explains her autistic stone-face ,
but the movie suffer for it .
she basically walks around like a zombie ,
and her success as an actress is not quite credible given her lack of emotion .
occasionally 
the movie had that dull ,
sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie .
is it one ?
i would not be at all surprised.summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix .
