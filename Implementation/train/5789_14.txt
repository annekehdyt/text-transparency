terrible ... just terrible .
probably the worst film i have ever seen .
and i did see some pretty bad picture 
throughout the year .
the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture 
the direction 
the acting ... etc 
etc .
the only good shoot
( meaning funny ,
because they are so bad )
are the special effect .
overall there are about 5 minute worth of laugh .
the rest of the flick gives you ain damage .
