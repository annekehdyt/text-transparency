hollywood always had trouble coming to term with a `` religious picture . ''
strange cargo proves to be no exception .
although utilizing the talent of a superb cast ,
and produced on a top budget 
with suitably moody photography by robert planck ,
the movie fails dismally on the credibility score .
perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic
that the sudden intrusion of fantasy element upsets the viewer 's involvement in the action and with the fate of the character .
i found
it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphor 
parallel and biblical reference ,
and impossible to accept bathed-in-light ian hunter 's smug know-it-all as a christ figure .
and the censor in boston 
detroit and providence at least agreed with me .
the movie was banned .
few boston/detroit/providence moviegoer 
if any 
complained or journeyed to other city
because it was obvious from the trailer
that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a `` message picture . ''
it flopped everywhere.oddly enough ,
the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv .
a home atmosphere appears to make the movie 's allegory more receptive to viewer .
however ,
despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film ,
the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable 
heavily moralistic line
that will have no-one guessing
how the principal character will eventually come to term with destiny .
