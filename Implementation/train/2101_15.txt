how many more of those fake `` slice of life '' movie need to be made ?
hopefully not too many.raising victor vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood .
nothing wrong with that in general .
what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and pile on every clich\u00e9 in the book of supposedly `` edgy '' hollywood independent production.it is supposed to be `` real ''
so left shake the camera `` documentary style '' ,
except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose ...
it is `` edgy '' so let 's not waste any time lighting
the film.it is `` hip '' ,
so let 's have the child use swear word like al pacino in scarface ...
and so on 
and so forth .
all
that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing hollywood
that will not impress anyone outside of the `` rarefied '' indie crowd
that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .
