for all of the has-been or never was 's or for the curious ,
this film is for you ...
.ever played a sport 
or wondered
what it felt like
after the light went down and the crowd left..this film explores that and more.robin william
( jack dundee )
is a small town assistant banker in taft ca. ,
whose life has been plagued 
by a miscue in a big rival high school football game 13 year ago ,
when he dropped the pass
that would have won over bakersfield 
their arch-rival ,
that takes great pleasure in pounding the taft rocket 
season after season .
kurt russell
( reno hightower )
was the quarterback in that famous game ,
and is the local legend ,
that now is a van repair specialist ,
whose life is fading into lethargy ,
like the town of taft itself.william gets an idea to remake history ,
by replaying the game !
he meets with skeptical resistance ,
so he goes on a one man terror spree ,
and literally paints the town 
orange 
yellow and black ,
to raise the ire of the resident to recreate the game .
after succeeding 
the player from that 1972 team reunite 
and try to get in shape to practice ,
which is hysterical .
the game is on ,
bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadget 
game strategy 
and sophisticated training routine .
taft is drawing play in the mud 
with stick 
stone 
and bottle cap 
what a riot !
does taft overcome the odd ,
does robin willian purge the demon from his bowel ,
does kurt russell rise from lethargy ,
watch `` the best of time '' for one of the best viewing experience ever !
one of robin william best understated performance 
the chemistry between robin and russell is magic .
and who is kid lester ? ?
? holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performance as the wife of william and russell .
succeeds on many level .
a 10 !
