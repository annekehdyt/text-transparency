`` whipped '' is 82 minute long .
this review is 82 word long .
three unlikable new york lothario 
ruthless `` scammer 
'' end up wooing the same woman ,
played by amanda peet 
with disastrous result .
that applies to the story and the film .
too sophomoric to be misogynistic 
flaccid and ridiculous 
`` whipped '' mix the philosophy of shock jock tom lykis with penthouse letter fantasy .
though technically proficient it is dated 
grating ,
poorly written 
mean 
and obvious .
person do not act like this .
person do not talk like this .
really .
