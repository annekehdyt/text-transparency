a group of human looking alien going to earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beast
instead where they all eat physcedelic mushroom and act retarded .
padded with footage from `` planet of the dinosuar '' and horrible joke this is definitely one to miss .
the acting is atrocious as well ,
and while this is not as bad as `` chickboxer ''
( what movie can be ? )
this is still pretty awful repugnant stuff .
it is 90 minute running time feel
like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life
so do yourself a huge favor
and just move on 
skip this crappy film ,
there is nothing to see here.the film-maker try to resell this turd as a mst3k style making fun of the movie they made a decade before 
and it works to an extent it is still nothing that watchable though 
ariauna alight is hot ,
but lilith stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice.my grade :
d- dvd extra :
joke commentary 
17 behind the scene featurette ; 7 minute into the black featurette ; jessica mill reporting ; still gallery ;
and original trailer
