a series of vignette 
most of them spoofing television of the 1970 's 
but also with some dig at the government and corporate america .
one of the longest segment 
`` the dealer '' is not that funny to me and i do not know
what it is parodying .
some of the other 
though 
are absolutely side-splitting .
i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment .
most of the foul word i know are used in the movie ,
and ,
if you object to full frontal nudity ,
stay away .
