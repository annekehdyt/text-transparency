i thought
this was a very clunky 
uninvolving version of a famous australian story .
heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their role ,
and gave their character some personality ;
but the whole thing felt
forced and mechanical.the beginning could have been a lot more involving ;
perhaps starting with a shootout ,
and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing .
and i felt
like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted ,
like a very bad tv soap.i was really looking forward to this movie ,
and hoping for something a lot better .
the only thing i can say
in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version 
but not by much .
