and a rather unexpected plot line too-for the era :
there is plague in the city of new orleans-and
only richard widmark can stop it !
elia kazan 's trademark subject :
waterfront ,
working man 
crowds 
fugitive 
blue collar folk ,
violence on a backstreet-are all showcased here.jack palance is quite effective as the ice-cold mobster out for a big score 
zero mostel as dom delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go-fer .
i enjoyed barbara bel gedde as the stalwart ,
cool wife-i thought
she and widmark were a believable couple.he
himself always reminds me somewhat of sinatra-in the face and in the intense quiet manner-and
that is meant as a complimant if anything .
i would never even heard of this movie ,
and yes 
you have to admire widmark 's performance .
i also enjoyed paul douglas-he seemed to play this role many time ,
they make an unlikely
but effective team.the plague itself is a mcguffin-and you got ta know
it is not exactly done the way
it would have been in real life-rather small-scale at the least no ?
-but i found
it carried the plot along nicely.check this out .
it is good .
