a movie about the cruelty of this world .
i found it liberating ,
as only truth can be .
it also contains some quite funny bit .
some of the acting is extraordinary ,
see marium hofst\u00e4tter for instance .
the director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible 
succeeding .
coherently 
the sex scene are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie .
although i hardly understood a sentence ,
i found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitle much more rewarding ,
because with the dubbing half the great work of the actor gets lost .
the voice of the character
played by marium hofst\u00e4tter
is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber.my favorite movie
