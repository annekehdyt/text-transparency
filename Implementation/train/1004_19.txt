this movie was bad from the start .
the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count .
the acting was horrible .
the killing were acted out very badly .
like when ally got stuffed down
that toilet i guess
it was in the abandoned cabin .
but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally
so angela must have gone in to get her .
the part that really got me
was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin
and angela took the guitar string and chocked her .
one it was horrible acting
and two why would not you just turn around and punch the bitch ? ! ? ! ?
then when molly is getting chased by angela
if you have the neigh why
not just turn around and stab her ? ? ?
so stupid .
this movie sucked ...
