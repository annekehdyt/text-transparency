after watching some of hbo 's great stuff -
band of brother 
rome 
etc .
- i must say
i had pretty high expectation
before watching the first episode of `` true blood '' .
jeez .
often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old ,
some part are just horribly filmed ,
( the scene
in which she `` save '' bill ,
i mean come on .
she throws a chain at the guy and ow !
it goes around his neck
and it magically chokes him !
that was pretty embarrassing
if you want my opinion .
or a few moment
before that scene ,
when she finds out
that the couple is gone with bill 
ridiculous .
she hears them plan their stuff 
and like 5 second later 
magic !
the 3 of them are gone ,
and without any struggle or noise or anything !
i mean the idea of the show seemed interesting 
mysterious 
intriguing 
vampires co-existing with human in our modern society ...
but honestly i do not think
they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show ,
that the average teen girl watch all the time
but that nobody else cares about ... unfortunately ,
the script is written poorly 
mediocre at best .
it is shallow and extremely predictable .
often i thought
that this was some kind of a joke or something .
the actor deliver really unconvincing performance ,
if you want my opinion .
they seem to take the show very lightly ,
as if it were some kind of a regular ,
low budget family tv show
( well maybe that what it is ,
if you take away the family part ) .
the only actor
that seemed somewhat good to me
was stephen moyer in the role of bill ,
considering the poorly written ,
extremely short reply he had to say
`` what are you ... ''
`` can i give you a call sometime ... '' ,
i think
he did good in inging out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire
that anyone with a vampire role must have 
actually .
anna paquin was okay as well 
but not more .
but the guy ,
playing her other though 
jeez ,
he is horrible .
the scene
in which he gets arrested
is just simply a shame to modern television .
the acting is bad ,
the construction site look fake to the bone ,
and the two other guy
`` why is he getting arrested ?
uh.. i dunno ... ''
that was pretty embarrassing .
another thing
that i think was completely missed
was the way
they presented sookie 's psychic power .
they make us hear what person think and speak both at the same time and that just wrong .
often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic ,
as if person 's thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel ,
and that
when she comes close to em
she hits the right frequency level
and has to hear everything
that they think .
and finally 
the sex scene are just plainly unnecessary
and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting .
do not get me wrong - i wrote all these comment
not because i thought the show was bad ,
but because i was very disappointed .
i expected quality stuff .
i did not think
it was going to be like that .
it is definitely not a good show though .
mediocre at best .
