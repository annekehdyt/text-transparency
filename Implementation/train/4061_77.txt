the play bell 
book 
and candle was a favorite of mature actress to do in summer stock
and take on the road .
one famous story ,
told by director harold j. kennedy ,
has ginger roger insisting
that her then husband 
william marshall ,
who was not an actor 
costar with her .
marshall wore a toupee ,
and
when he walked through a doorway ,
his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind ,
dangling in the doorway
as he walked on stage.the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak 
jame stewart 
jack lemmon 
elsa lanchester 
hermoine gingold 
ernie kovacs 
and janice rule .
it is light entertainment 
about a normal-appearing family of witch
( novak 
lemmon 
and lanchester )
and the publisher
( stewart )
who lives in their building .
the most expert of them is the sultry 
soft-voiced gillian ,
who would love to be normal .
one night 
with stewart in her apartment 
she puts a spell on him using her siamese cat 
pyewacket ,
and he falls in love with her .
`` bell book and candle '' was filmed on a charming set
that replicates new york .
the movie is load of fun .
jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as gillian 's other 
a musician in the witch and warlock-laden zodiac club .
he uses his power to turn streetlight on and off
and to turn on the occasional woman .
janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of gillian 
now dating stewart ,
and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric
who is writing the definitive book on witch .
lanchester and gingold 
of course 
are always wonderful ,
lanchester gillian 's daft aunt and gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft.kim novak is a good fit for gillian ,
giving the character a detachment befitting a witch ,
showing emotion
when it becomes appropriate ,
and with that voice 
fabulous face 
and magnificent wardrobe 
she certainly is magical .
stewart 
in his last foray as a romantic lead 
costar with novak as he did in vertigo ,
and they make an effective team .
he supplies the warmth ,
she supplies the coolness ,
and somehow 
together they spark .
in this 
of course 
he is much more elegant than in `` vertigo . ''
a charming film 
good for a sunday afternoon 
good around christmas
( as part of it takes place at christmastime ) ,
and great if you feel like smiling .
