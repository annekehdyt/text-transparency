this movie is intelligent .
that is 
more than most other movie ,
it transcends the least common denominator -
stupid person will probably not appreciate it .
the story also relies heavily on dialogue .
it has some parallel
to lost in translation ,
although before sunrise is much ighter 
somehow less abstract ,
and simply a lot better.the script ,
the character and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic .
the actor play absolutely illiantly .
rarely have i seen a movie
where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.the dialogue move into very personal issue 
with the risk
of becoming a little over the top .
it does 
however 
stay on the right side almost all the time ,
although i found a few moment a little awkward and embarrassing .
balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actor .
sometimes ,
it yields great result ,
and overall this movie is simply stupendous !
only very 
very rarely is `` love '' in film
depicted in a way
that i find trustworthy and realistic .
every time
that is achieved ,
the result is fantastic .
i think
the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect .
she still looks stunning in this film ,
12 year after.this is simply a gem of a movie
that you can not miss .
one of the best movie i have seen from the 1990s !
