this might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made .
the writer and producer should study the german film of the thirty and forty .
they knew how to sell .
even soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father-figure were better done .
disappointing .
the loss of faith 
regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be `` saved '' by the hoover/god
was not too bad .
unfortunately 
it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough .
a few misty heavenlier shot of the angelical hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot .
the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and child
who had `` proven '' their worth .
unfortunately 
other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the hoover-god does not help them .
a better approach would have been shot of them drinking spirit
to show the justice of their condition .
finally 
ight and cheerful scene of recovery
( after hoover saved the country from the depression )
should have rolled at the end .
we could see
then how hoover-god had saved not just this deserving family ,
but all the truly deserving .
amateurist at best .
