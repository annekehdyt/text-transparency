this was a gem .
amazing acting from the lead liam cunningham 
orla brady and all the supporting cast .
the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history
but to many community around the world and many marriage unit within those community .
with intensity and sincerity the movie shows
how the religious conviction and tradition drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family .
the title `` love divided '' could not capture it any better .
even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the 50th seeing
how the life of the whole village erode and `` pogrom '' are starting reminded me of russian history .
the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world
and unfortunately it is deeply hidden inside the human nature .
just like in the movie the liam cunningham 's character says
`` the hatred had always been there under the surface '' .
it was interesting to watch the moral choice person were making in this story .
also the character of a catholic priest
and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful .
the story however gives hope
that love of two person can conquer everything
and love makes us better 
stronger .
liam cunningham 's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man
he always wanted to be .
again acting is a top notch .
story is fast-paced .
irish countryside is as beautiful as ever .
highly recommended .
