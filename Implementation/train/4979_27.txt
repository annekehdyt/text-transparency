i started watching the show from the first season ,
and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it .
original movie was kind of childish ,
and i was just looking for some sci-fi show
while waiting for the bsg new season.but
after few episode i became a fan .
i have loved the character -
the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill 
the not-only-smart samantha carter 
the glorious teal'c 
woman and kid favorite 
and illiant dr. daniel jackson.of course 
story sometimes not serious 
sometimes even ridiculous ,
but mostly it is not about technology or space fighting -
it is about helping your friend 
even risking your life for him .
it is about `` we do not leave anybody behind '' .
struggling to the end
when all hope is lost .
about the free will ,
and all good quality
that makes a human - human.and
now it
is eaking a record 
going 10th season ,
and still doing good .
