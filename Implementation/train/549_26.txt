i had the pleasure
of viewing this beautiful film last night ,
with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing .
i suspect
that the first commenter has never lost a parent
or someone very close to them in death .
i have had many such loss ,
and this movie spoke to me .
one of the major theme is how we do not deal with questions/issues/story with our loved one
until it is too late
-- they are too incapacitated or dead
before that happens .
talk to your loved one 
listen to and record their story ,
tell person you love them 
resolve difference .
i loved the message
that there are no mistake .
i love the director 's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughter
-- as one of six sibling 
it is clear to me he understood
how complex those relationship are .
his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear
-- what a beautiful movie !
the casting is outstanding
-- a film not to be missed !
