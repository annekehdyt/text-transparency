obnoxious eva longorium dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel
( without wing )
falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her .
she is then try to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend 
a psychic
who can see her.obvious unoriginal movie would not be bad in a clich\u00e9d sort of way ,
except that longorium 's character is hateful and obnoxious
that she drains all of the fun out of the film .
its like
having your ears
cleaned with sandpaper .
to be fair longorium ,
nor anyone else in the cast or crew ,
is not the problem ,
its the god awful script
that sinks the proceedings .
its just really really stupid .
