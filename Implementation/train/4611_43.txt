ok 
i have watched the original french version .
but i can not imagine this being better with subtitles.all i
have to say
that this is the most boring movie i
have seen in a long time .
there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film .
that is why i can not understand all the positive review .
it might be realistic in a sense
but some real story are best left untold.i usually like slow paced movie as long
as it serves the purpose of the movie .
tarkovsky 's solaris is extremely slow paced
but it allows introspection
and sets the mood of the film for example .
but in this case 
the movie is just filed with mindless dialog
that manage to tell us little about the character .
none of which i could identify with or care for .
in a lot of the scene i found myself thinking :
`` when are they going to shut up '' ?
the acting was pretty bad .
not in an overacting obvious kind of way .
but it seems none of the actor cared about their character
and they all looked
like
they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scene .
this might be due to the uninspired dialog
they were given .
also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical .
going from one scene to the next .
it seems this movie was just written
( badly )
but never directed.this is one of the few film
that
i can say
generated no emotional response from any of the scene .
no suspense 
no fear 
no anticipation 
no sorrow 
no introspection 
no intellectual stimulation 
no interest what so ever.a perfect example of what i call an anti-movie .
