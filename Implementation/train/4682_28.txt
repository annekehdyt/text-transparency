i used to watch this show
when i was a little girl .
when i think about it ,
i only remember it vaguely .
if you ask me ,
it was a good show .
two thing i remember
vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song .
in addition to that 
everyone was ideally cast .
also 
the writing was very strong .
the performance were top-grade 
too .
i hope
some network ings
it back so i can see every episode .
before i wrap this up 
i would like to say
that i will always remember this show in my memory forever ,
even though i do not think
i have seen every episode .
now 
in conclusion ,
if some network ever ings it back ,
i hope
that you catch it one day
before it goes off the air for good .
