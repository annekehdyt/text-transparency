proof
that not everything tarantino touch turns to gold .
this is most definitely plastic 
all the way .
its easy to see
that
without quentin 's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for year ,
that is assuming
it would have ever got produced in the first place .
it is about a woman with a fascination of death
who gets a job cleaning up after crime scene ,
angela jone is unconvincing in this role ,
william baldwin is better as the serial killer
who keeps jone in employment ! .
all in all pretty poor .
