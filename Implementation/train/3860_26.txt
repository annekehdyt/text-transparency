one of the silliest movie of the 1940s 
an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser .
kyer 
orchestra leader and radio-star
( and eternal college fraternity goof-off ) ,
was sort of the precursor to spike jone ,
hamming it up for his guest
and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musician .
he is hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion ,
the kind
where poison dart imported from africa
are framed
and hung on the wall .
the shindig is beset with a creepy judge 
a scary professor 
an ominous swami 
lot of giggly female ,
and enough bad joke
to fill three bob hope picture .
the song
( by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer )
are nothing to ag out ,
and neither is over-confident kyser ,
yukking it up with elbow-in-the-ribs material
that turns 1940 back ten year .
