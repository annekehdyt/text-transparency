jason lee 's peck are back !
if that is what you are looking for ,
look no further .
if not ,
better move on ...
but about the movie .
clich\u00e9s galore 
some poorly shot
but kinda exotic fight scene
( used jkd )
and lot of bad acting and cheap effect .
poor lee look like he is in pain throughout the movie 
and no wonder .
not a pleasant comeback.the movie does not even cut it as a b-movie - sure ,
there was a germanish bleached blonde rutger-wannabe bad guy ,
but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shot .
none .
zip .
nada .
even in starship trooper 2 they had the common sense
to include the mandatory nudie scene
( as for rest of my comment on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence 
please refer to our upcoming review on that mind-blowing sequel ... ) .
i did get the feeling
that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this -
thus i will not get into the `` plot '' of the movie or pretty much anything else related .
except that it did have some non-heterosexual overtone ,
so 'nuff said.however 
this movie has one thing
going for it - no jean-claude : )
