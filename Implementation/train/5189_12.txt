mighty morphin power ranger has got to be the worst television show ever made .
there is no plot ,
just a bunch of silly costumed kid using martial art
while dressed up in second class spandex outfits.the special effect look
like they are from the '70 's ,
the costume look like something out of a bad comedy ,
and the show is just plain awful.the only thing worse
than the television show are the toy ,
just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kid.there are far better show for your kid to watch !
try giving your kid something like nickelodean ,
those show actually have some intelligence behind them 
unlike power ranger .
