me and a friend rented this movie
because it sounded really good .
but we were wrong .
first of the acting ... .wow ...
the acting was the worst ,
the effect were really bad as well ,
it seemed like a film a college kid made .
the plot was pretty good ,
but it would been done .
the thing
that ruined the movie
the most were the actor .
the main guy was the worst actor ever ...
it is a shame i am
even calling him an actor ...
the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad
it was funny ... so
if you want a good laugh see
it ... .but other
than that ... stay far away from this one .
i usually love b list movie and such ,
but this one ... i do not know
how it was passed to even be put on video ...
this one is the worst i
have seen..and i have seen some bad one .
