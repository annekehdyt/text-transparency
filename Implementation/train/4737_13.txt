i love this show ,
it is sure to be a winner .
jessica alba does a great job ,
it is about time we have a kick-ass girl
who 's not the cutesy type .
the entire cast is wonderful
and all the episope have good plot .
everything is layed out well ,
and thought over .
to put it together must have taken a while ,
because it was not someone in a hurry
that just slapped something together .
it is a great show altogether .
