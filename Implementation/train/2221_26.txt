... which is not exactly a ringing endorsement .
overall 
`` dinocroc '' was a much better movie .
sure 
in that movie matt borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag
who spent the entire movie crying about his little other
getting eaten by the dinocroc .
but the special effect in `` dinocroc '' were better ,
the plot line were better ,
and the acting was better .
here are the problem with `` blood surf ''
-- 1 )
the killer crocodile looks like a kid 's model with a retractable jaw .
2 ) the plot is ridiculous .
matt borlenghi and co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island ,
in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly filipino native
who try to force themselves upon the woman in the group .
which was a complete waste of 15 minute of film .
and 3 ) there is not enough croc time .
there are a couple of redeeming quality of `` blood surf ''
-- the actress are pretty attractive
and matt borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie .
but if you are on your deathbed
and only have enough time
to watch one matt borlenghi/killer crocodile movie 
skip this one and fire up `` dinocroc '' instead .
