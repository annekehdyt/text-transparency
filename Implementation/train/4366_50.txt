if i write a review about a movie ,
maybe it will stick with me ...
but generally i expect
that i will have forgotten
i
have seen this one a mere two week from now .
so why bother ?
because again i find myself watching a low-rated movie
that was fun to watch .
i did not expect i would to be able to stay in the room
while it was on.it was not great ,
but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of error
which always makes me cringe .
it was just sweet fluff ...
and if you can not take it ,
stay in the locker room boy .
i agree with those
who defend this movie
because it is sure to please its targeted demographic ,
and will not be a total bore to an adult.it offers a few good chuckle here and there 
but nary a side splitter .
sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining ,
but at least it does not suck
( as so many have said
it does ) .
maybe those folk are afraid of their sensitive side ?
i have a tendency
to grade on the bell curve ,
so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book .
giving it a 4 makes sense
and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing .
giving it a 1 or a 10 ,
as most have done thus far ,
makes the rating number meaningless .
i can not believe
how strongly person feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff
( or that i am even bothering to write about it ) .
am i missing something ?
anyway 
it should be noted that emma robert performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly .
ariell kebbel often written into b*ch role does not disappoint
when her character gets her due .
you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard ,
though his role is ancillary.surely you can miss this one
if you are an adult .
but ,
if there is a pre-teen girl in your life ,
rent this movie for her ...
and be prepared not to hate it
( you might even enjoy it ) .
