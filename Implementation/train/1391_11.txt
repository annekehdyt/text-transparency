what can i say about this film
that has not already been said ?
well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slap and the kick .
how charlie sheen though this was real i do not know .
im sure
they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder
if it was .
however the scene with the pinching and the hot oil look very real .
and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done
and is probibly the only thing on film
that has ever shocked me .
