mesmerizing 
eathtaking and horrifying 
this hauntingly beautiful film is the `` apocalypse now ''
without fiction .
slow in pace 
quiet in mood 
it gives good glimpse of the poisoned patch of earth
that may well be sign of an inevitable doom.there
is no doubt in my mind
-- the nature is plagued
and we are the disease .
greed 
the very essence of humanity
that drives evolution and progress ,
has turned us into something like cancer ,
on its way
to consume the host and die with it ... manufactured landscape is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i will never regard my toaster and iron the same way again .
