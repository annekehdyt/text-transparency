i picked this one up
because the music was done by han zimmer 
a customer of metasonix modular synth
( made by someone dear to me ) .
the jacket art says
`` the 2003 version '' .i give it one point for a strong female 
one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster 's light blue eye ,
of which there are plenty of shot of.it
was fun
seeing david maccullum casually swimming
( the pool has a plexiglass viewing window !
) ,
while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece .
the set were marginally impressive-that is 
rich person 's house in l.a. and mendanassos
( sp ?
) ,
where the castle was .
i found myself wondering
how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around .
the wind was not fierce enough to be believable to me .
i kept thinking
that the animal pelt on the furniture must be nasty ... etc .
and realized
that the film must be pretty boring
if i am wondering these thing
when the supposed plot was unfolding .
i stumbled over thing
like why did she light a fire ,
blow out the match ,
then throw the match into the fire ? !
dumb stuff like that .
it was clunky at best .
oh well .
robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .
