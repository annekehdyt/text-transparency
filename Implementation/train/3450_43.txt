as a huge fan of horror film 
especially j-horror and also gore i thought
nekeddo bur\u00e2ddo sounded pretty good .
i researched the plot 
read review ,
and even looked at some photo
to make sure
it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch
before downloading it .
so excited it had finished
and ready to be scared
and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting
i was terribly disappointed .
the plot was ridiculous
and did not even make sense and left too much unexplained ,
the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying ,
and what was with the cartoon style sound effect ?
the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it .
i did not understand the cactus idea and the way
the mother husband disappeared in the middle of the sea
after following a flashing light ,
they left both pretty unexplained ,
or perhaps i missed it
as my mind could not understand what i was actually seeing .
i appreciate the way
it was supposed to be ; shocking and a few scene
( the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing ?
) certainly were ,
i just think
they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way ,
they made it to unconvincing
which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion .
however it is a very entertaining film
and got a lot of laugh out of me and a couple of friend ,
but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value ,
but do not be expecting a dark 
deeply scary and horrifying film ;
you will just be disappointed .
if this was a horror comedy/spoof i would probably rate it about a nine ,
the climax being the weird scene
when the husband climbed inside his wife 's stomach
and closed up her wound ,
but as a horror sadly i gave it a one .
