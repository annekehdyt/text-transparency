chesty gringo telly savala
( as frank cooper )
is a us-mexico `` border cop '' .
he serves as a father figure to young immigrant danny de la paz
( as benny romero ) ,
who wants mr. savala to be best man at his impending wedding .
savala is tough ,
but boss eddie albert
( as commander moffat )
may be tougher .
tough is what you need to stop smuggler michael v. gazzo
( as chico suarez ) .
alliance may be in flux.if
you find the possibility of hearing `` kojak '' and `` oliver dougla '' uttering expletive
to be repulsive ,
you ought to steer clear of `` the border '' .
if not 
you may not have the stomach for the `` realistic '' cow slaughtering scene .
although it does not end up being worth much 
mr. de la paz and cecilia camacho
( as leina )
steal the show .
