first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book ,
especially when you are dealing with master writer like tolkien .
this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien 's universe with 1970s psychedelium 
aesthetic 
and liberal culture .
yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little `` rough '' in its technical execution
but it is beautiful none the less ,
and very evocative in term of giving a unique `` sense of place '' to each of the scene .
beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice
acting - acting
that is far superior to the acting in the new live action movie .
and while the cell animation might not be the most `` technically proficient '' animation
it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gesture of the acting
while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced .
the background painting vary from traditional `` fantasy '' motif to outright abstraction ,
but the transition to abstracted setting is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the theme of the film .
if you are a person
who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film
so
that everything is visualized for you then i can see
how you might not like this movie
but
if you enjoy superior acting 
transcendental imagery ,
and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see .
