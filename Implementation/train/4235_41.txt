this is absurd - aside from the fellow australian
who has reviewed this flick ,
i can not help but think
that everyone else
who has submitted a review so far
was some way
involved in the production of elektra ,
considering
how generous
they were with their praise.admittedly i am not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversion
so i did not go in with many expectation ,
yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming .
the thing
that irked me the most
was the fact
that there was so much in this film
which went by unexplained ,
that left you thinking `` huh ,
what relevance does that have to the plot ? ''
or `` so how did that aspect of the character come about ? ''
i can only hope
that these are thing
which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil ,
which i have no intention of seeing.furthermore ,
the behaviour of the character in this film appear to do an about-face at random moment
to suit the storyline ,
and do not even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot .
i am also
( still )
scratching my head over the fate of cary-hiroyuki tagawa 's character ,
which seems to have gone by unexplained.if i can give kudos to this movie for anything
it would have to be the fantastic location
in which it was shot ,
but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra .
i know
we are supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action film ,
but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing
( even by action film standard )
that it simply frustrated me.well 
hell 
at least jennifer garner looks damn good .
