i just have to throw my two cent in .
relax 
it is a comedy .
yes for the most part the character are oadly written and acted .
i can not think of many comedy
where they are not .
this is not a new release ,
it is out on video and air on cable almost every week .
would i see it in a theater ?
sure 
i did ,
when it first came out .
it is funny ...
that should be enough.even
if i did not like it at all i would still watch it on cable for michael keaton .
he is an underrated and under-appreciated actor .
i can not think of another who is so capable in every genre .
nor can i think of one
who 's as successful .
a comedic actor
who 's also an action star
( short lived but still ) ,
who 's also a romantic lead ,
who 's also a dramatic actor ;
a villain and a hero .
i can not think of any 
at least not in hollywood .
certainly none who have been successful at all those genre .
i mean there is tom cruise
but to me he is better at being tom cruise
than becoming a character .
however this is not about michael keaton vs. tom cruise
so i will move on.gung ho is worth renting ,
heck it is worth buying
since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at store like wal-mart .
it is worth watching on cable
( if you have cable or satellite ) .
it is one of those fun to watch movie .
you can put your ain on pause ,
and just relax 
and chuckle away.to ask for more 
in my honest opinion 
is asking too much .
