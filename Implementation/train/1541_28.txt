i thought
they should have called this movie `` white '' instead of `` height '' .
godawful ... the kind of film
that makes person hate new yorker .
person
who are so self obsessed
and think
their life are so important ...
give me a eak .
such a lily white cast
that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it ,
this film was crying out for someone real
to come in and steal it ...
and so they introduce 
get this 
a character even whiter than the rest of the cast
( i thought
he was an albino at first )
who 's supposed to be welsh !
i am still trying to decipher that accent !
intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of film
that is able to fool so many person
into thinking
it is worthwhile
because it has the trapping of something more ambitious .
better to fill the theater with mi5-10 than with this pretentious crap ...
must have been a better play
because you can not fall off the floor .
