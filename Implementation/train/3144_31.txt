where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama
and is shot well in black and white and on location
as well.a copper accidentally kills a bloke
who is suspected of murder and to protect himself ,
he covers this up
and blames it on another person
he does not like
who has committed a lot of crime in the past .
but towards the end 
he owns up
but not before falling in love with a woman
he meets
who is the lover of the person
he killed ...
the cast includes dana andrew
( while the city sleeps 
curse of the demon ) 
gene tierney
( laura 
the ghost and mrs muir ) ,
gary merrill
( mysterious island ) ,
karl malden
( the street of san francisco 
beyond the posidon adventure )
and craig steven
( the deadly mantis ) .
good part from all.where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out
if you get the chance .
excellent.rating :
3 star out of 5 .
