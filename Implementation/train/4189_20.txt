this is a bad movie .
not one of the funny bad one either .
this is a lousy bad one .
it was actually painful to watch .
the direction was awful ,
with lot of jumping around and the green and yellow hue used throughout
the movie makes the character look sickly .
keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all ,
and i can not believe
lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid .
the script was terrible
and the acting was like fingernail across a chalkboard .
if you have not seen it ,
do not .
you are not missing anything
and will only waste two hour of your life
watching this drivel .i
have seen bad movie
before and even enjoyed them due to their fault .
this one is just a waste of time .
