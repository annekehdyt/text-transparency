this film was just absolutly illiant .
it actually made me think .
during the whole movie i was confused as hell .
i loved everything about it ...
it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird ,
it was hard not to love it .
all of the actor were phenominal ,
and no one could have done a better job ...
this is one of my favorite of the year ...
it deserves an ocar .
