... .because
if i was ,
i may have wished
it was me being crucified on a wooden cross !
i am still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and i am being `` generous ''
that there was even a plot
to begin with .
as previously mentioned ,
it is a misnomer on the cover of the dvd
that richard dreyfuss is actually the star .
he was barely in the movie .
and if he was indeed `` frustrated ''
as the back cover indicated
he was 
well ,
that is probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie
and could not get out of it !
the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin ,
and what his role in the movie was supposed to be ,
other than the extreme close -up 
was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry 's role actually was - or was not .
and speaking of `` big '' ... whomever had the ight idea
to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire ,
which showcased his trouser literally pulled up to his chin ,
should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober .
i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was 
from the dialogue not matching the `` actor ' '' mouth
( think clutch cargo ) ,
to the erratic jumping from scene to scene
( again ,
being generous
even calling the frame of picture `` scene '' ) ,
to the lack of a plot ... . however ,
if you are into bad early 70s genre
and if you are in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid and cat picture ,
i recommend having a good bottle of wine
before you embark on this weird ride of a movie
because you will be thankful
that you may not remember it the next day !
