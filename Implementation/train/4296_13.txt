in an interview 
david duchovny said
he has not been able to watch even the first hour of this film -
and neither should you .
the scene
where he asks the owner of a house
where a murder was committed
if he can look around -
change
the name he gives
and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the x-file .
he is on autopilot for the whole film .
brad pitt overacts appallingly .
