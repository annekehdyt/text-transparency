this was keaton 's first feature
and is in actuality three short ,
set in different period
( stone age 
roman age 
modern age )
on the eternal triangle of romance .
the story parallel each other as in griffith 's intolerance ,
which this was intended to satirize .
the strength of the joke and gag almost all rely on anachronism 
inging modern day business into ancient setting .
**** warning - spoiler follow to elaborate best point ******here are the classic moment :
using a turtle as a wee-gee board
( stone age ) ;
a wrist watch containing a sun dial
( roman age ) ;
a chariot with a spare wheel
( roman age ) ;
using a helmet as a tire lock
( roman age ) ; early golf with club and rock
( stone age ) ;
dictating a will being carved into a rock
( stone age ) ;
the changing weather forecaster
( roman age ) ;
the chariot race in snow -buster
using ski
and husky with a spare dog in the chariot 's boot
( roman age )
.the above are all throw-away gag
that keep us chuckling .
there are however unforgettable moment as well :
buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl
putting on make-up ;
the fantastic double take
when an ineiated buster gaze at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him
( within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position
and leaped again into the arm of the waiter - one of the funniest moment i have ever seen ) .
and that lion -
the manicure -just illiant.there is also an off-color bit of racism
when four african-american litter bearer abandon their mistress for a roman crap game.kino 's print is a bit fuzzy
and contains numerous sequence of both nitrate deterioration and film damage- most probably at end of reel .
the metro feature is scored with piano and flute
and borrow heavily from grieg.lot of fun and full of laugh .
