every christmas eve i make my kid endure yet another showing
of it is a wonderful life .
i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa .
so sue me .
i admit it .
i like cheesy 
schmaltzy movie .
i like excellent 
intelligent one too ,
but as with so many thing ,
variety is a good thing .
what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of santa in all his guise 
from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton ?
fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls ,
but i do not believe
a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed .
`` fred '' is a perfectly ok holiday movie 
with enough humor for the adult and sufficient charm for the kid .
my wife and i laughed a lot ,
even if most of the humor was obvious
and vince was just being vince .
paul giamatti was a top-notch santa ,
which helped a lot .
not a great flick 
and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone 's annual christmas tradition .
but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was 
holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice .
there is nothing wrong with that .
