watched on hulu
( far too many commercial ! )
so it oke the pacing but even still ,
it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixty .
dean martin and jerry lewis
where both part are played by jerry lewis .
if i were indian ,
i would protest the portrayal of all male as venal and all woman as shrew .
they cheated for the music videos for western sale
and used a lot of western model
so the male could touch
them i usually enjoy indian film a lot
but this was a major disappointment 
especially for a modern indian film .
the story does not take place in india
( the uncle keeps
referring to
when mac will return to india )
but i can not find out
where it is supposed to be happening .
