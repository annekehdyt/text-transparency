as far as i am
concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made .
there is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version ,
it is all macae 
germanic 
sinister nonsense .
it reminded me of nazis falling in love ;
who cares ?
this silent version by von stroheim
is not a faithful adaptation of the original story .
in this one we have leering john gilbert and his gross relative the prince lusting after this silly american actress ,
played by mae murray 
possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner
that threw me off again and again .
i like my romance light and beautiful 
with slow build up ;
not harsh and sadistic like this one .
and come on 
those bee stung lip ,
get rid of them 
girl !
go see a live performance of the show
if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by franz lehar .
failing that 
wait till tcm shows the jeanette macdonald - maurice chevalier sound version .
it is much better .
