a yawn-inducing 
snail-paced disappointment 
inside man tells the story of a detective
( denzel washington )
who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money .
when a bank is robbed
and hostage are held against their will by a mastermind thief
( clive owen )
and his team 
the detective is assigned to coerce the thief
to surrender \u0096 his one shot at proving
he is innocent and worthy of his position .
enter a powerful woman
( jodie foster )
with secret and intent of her own ,
sent to recover an item from the bank owner 's safety deposit box
that is stored within the bank ,
and you have quite the three-way dilemma .
unfortunately 
all you get it set-up in the film ,
and nothing pay off in the end .
denzel washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance .
the only saving grace for the film is its competent co-star jodie foster and clive owen ,
who are much better than the film itself .
in fact 
jodie foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance
playing against type as a ruthless 
cutthroat villain of sort .
clive owen is not given much to do beside ood and pose ,
but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role .
it is strange
that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest .
you have to wonder what director spike lee was thinking
while he was creating this film .
the most perplexing aspect of inside man 
however 
is how much unwarranted praise
it has received .
for a film
that seemed to have all the making of a pre-summer blockbuster ,
this one falls horribly flat .
