not too keen on this really .
the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing .
i enjoyed the first 10 minute 
bill nunns good .
after that it was pretty appalling .
tim does not fit the role ,
he comes across
as a smug self inflated ass and pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player .
it is a idealist film and as a musician ,
feel slightly offended
after watching it .
there is no scene of 1900 practising
or playing with his fellow band mate ,
he is completely self indulgent .
i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character ,
maybe i am watching the wrong film .
if you have no real passion for life or sense of what music all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle .
