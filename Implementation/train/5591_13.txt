for a first film in a proposed series
it achieves the right balance .
it is done with style and class
showing modesty 's early day as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world .
i think
it is a very honest/true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o'donnell intended .
alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice .
she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool/intelligent/innocence .
and full mark to tarantino
for choosing an unknown actress for the role -
much more believeable to have a new face
creating the part .
i am looking forward to the next film .
