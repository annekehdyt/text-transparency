blade runner
( deckard is a replican not !
) 
city of lost child
( augmented sense or whatever used and abused and mostly 
well ,
just giving us far less than what we might dream of ) 
anddark city :
these really ought to be added.for a while now ,
i have been waiting for an animated film
that might affect me as much
as miyazaki 's stuff has .
this one is the 1st.hmm ,
scratch the `` animated '' part of that.i have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and 
hey ,
if you do not leave ,
it must be mostly love 
right ?
but 
there are so many sci-fi
and noir theme totally submerged in this film
that it is just a wonder to watch.these person
did an incredible job !
