do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation ?
technically 
i am a boomer ,
though at the time
when all the `` idealistic youth '' of the '60 were reading marx ,
burning their draft card ,
and generally prolonging a war
which destroyed ten of thousand of life ;
i was still in grade school .
but i remember them well ,
and 9/10 were just moronic fool ,
who would believe anything
as long as it was destructive.this is just another excercise in self-importance from the kid
who never really grew up .
