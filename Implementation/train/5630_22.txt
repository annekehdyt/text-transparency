this one is out there .
not much to say about it
except that it deals with a rarely touched topic
in film of beastiality .
i can see
why this film was banned for so long ,
the topic dealt within
the film are still a little taboo for most of the world
will say
the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fit in with the mood of the film .
it is a good film
that is well acted
and serves a purpose ...
to shock the viewer and cross boundary
that we do not see to often in film .
i came across this film on the net
that
i thought
i might check out .
i enjoyed the film
as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time .
something you do not rarely see in film today .
