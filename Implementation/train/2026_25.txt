geez !
this is one of those movie
that
you think
you previously reviewed
but you did not .
i mean 
you did not give a crap about it
but somehow it came to your mind.to be honest and ief ;
this is one of the worst 
boring 
and stupid slasher ever made .
i can not say anything good about this piece of crap
because there are barely decent sequence
that could tell
it is made by professional film makers.the death scene
are horrible 
bloodless 
stupid .
the plot is somehow good taking in account
that it copied `` popcorn '' from 1991.to make thing even worse ,
this is not a movie so bad
that it is good .
it is just plain bad.molly ringwald tried to do her best
but it was not enough .
