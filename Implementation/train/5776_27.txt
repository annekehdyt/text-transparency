some have compared this film to deliverance .
i believe
of mouse and man is more appropriate .
our leading man 
heaton 
definitely loves spike .
it is irrelevant and immaterial
whether that is a sexual love .
it is the reason
heaton does not leave spike .
he needs him .
they need each other .
as other 
as family 
as their only connection to humanity .
the setting 
scenario 
minimal cast all add up to a fine film .
frankly 
i did not care what happened to the character .
but 
i did care about what the film maker did with them .
he did well with them .
i spent some time
wondering
how the ending would resemble of mouse and man .
the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing .
