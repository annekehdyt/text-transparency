this `` film '' is the culmination of everything
that is bad about modern film .
unnecessary slow motion 
unnecessary flipping/jumping/somersault 
unnecessary character 
unnecessary dialogue ... .
basically unnecessity .
( is that a word ?
well 
it is just been invented by i 
robot .
)
what happened to practicality ?
( i.e .
the car garage 
the skin spray )
the only tool
that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function
is the card swipe at the coffee shop.what happened
to showing respect for woman ?
( i.e .
smith 's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film ,
and yet she still `` wants '' him .
where is the tension ?
i will tell you where 
good look and not admiration or common ground )
what happened to a detective that detects ?
smith did nothing but sit around
and feel sorry for himself ,
complaining to other person ,
and when they said something
that sparked a thought
he was off .
this is such a lame way
to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ...
it was ok once ,
but not several time in a row .
( speaking of several time in a row ,
what was the `` i am snoring
and not listening to you joke ?
twice in one scene ?
)
what happened to the small part in a movie
being somewhat meaningful
and not just a tool
to promote rescue scene ?
shia labeouf
( the kid )
is in the movie for a total of two scene ,
we know
that a-he degrade woman ,
and b-he know smith ... ... .
so of course we should care about him
and whether or not he comes to harm ,
what happened to hero 's ?
let 's just forget
that there are person 
woman and child everywhere
getting attacked by robot and selfishly save the only person withing my view
that i have an acquaintance with .
and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air ,
showing off ,
while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of second on foot.do not get me wrong ,
i am all for spectacle .
but i am also all for a shred of realism and meaning.i have to say
i have never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time .
so thanks alex .
i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler technique 
simpler story and simpler everything else in film ... ...
but mainly simpler technique.big budget action film :
`` you so have to die ''
