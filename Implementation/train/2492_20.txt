williamson 's accent is tough to wade through .
he speaks incredibly quickly ,
like he is in a rush
to get through the line .
during the soliloquy he acts
as if
he is talking to someone ,
when he is supposed to be talking to himself .
all that and his bald spot just annoyed me .
he was just too old for this role .
in reading other account of williamson ,
maybe he got this role
because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life-imitates-art or forced method acting .
when the actor declare hamlet mad you believe it !
marianne faithful is a stunning beauty
and could botch the role of ophelia
and still get a pass .
the set is dark and foreboding
but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scene in the tunnels/corridor
where the dead king shine as a great light in the sky .
