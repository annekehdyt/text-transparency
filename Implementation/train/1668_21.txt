this movie features a gorgeous unette
named danielle petty .
she has stunning green eye ,
and is in the first few scene and the last scene .
she is the only thing about this movie
that is not repulsive .
she may not have a future as an actress ,
because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster
that kills careers.the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it .
it is not a good horror film 
or a good fake journalistic report 
or remotely well done .
there is no skill apparent
in it is production .
it is like a bad student film .
the story 's horrific element do not make you sick ,
it is the fact
that it is so poorly done
that makes you sick .
i would give this movie zero star
if i could .
