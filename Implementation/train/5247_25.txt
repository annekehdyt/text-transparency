not an altogether bad start for the program
-- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcemant .
the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare
-- and is anything but .
man and woman
that dedicate their life to the enforcemant of law deserve better than this .
what is next 
medical school in a minute ?
charo performing lipo ?
charle grodin assisting on a hip replacemant ?
c'mon ... show a little respect .
even the citizen of muncie are outing the program as staged .
polouse academy = high school gym ?
poor editing
( how many time can they use the car-to-car shot of the taco bell in the background ?
) 
cheesy siren effect
( the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call '
whether rolling code or not ) ,
and last 
but not least
-- more officer safety issue
than you could shake a stick at.if i
want to see manufactured polouse work and wise-ass fake cop ,
i would watch reno 911 .
