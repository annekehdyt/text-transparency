though i have yet to review the movie in about two year ,
i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low
as it did .
having loved the original little mermaid ,
and
having been obsessed with mermaid as a child could be ,
i decided i would take the time
to sit down and watch the sequel.disney ,
i have got a little message for you .
if you do not have the original director
and actor handy ... you are just looking to get your butt whooped.in the sequel ,
our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter 
melody .
my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang .
yes 
i understand
that disney is big on sing-and-dance number 
but really ,
that is what made eric my favorite prince .
he was calm 
collected 
and a genuine gentleman
that knew how to have fun .
and he did .
not .
sing.and then there is the villain .
oh 
how could we forget the shiver
that coursed down our spine whenever ursula slunk onto the screen ,
terrifying both ariel and audience around the world ?
unfortunately 
that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister 
morgana .
nothing was ever ,
ever said about morgana in the first movie ;
she just pops out of nowhere ,
trying to steal the baby .
oh 
how cute .
the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident 
decides to kidnap a month-old baby .
gag me.other
than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her ,
morgana was just very unorthodox .
the same plan as her sister 
the same minion
( who 
by the way ,
did not scare anyone .
i had a three year old on my lap
when i watched this movie ,
and she laughed hysterically . )
she had no purpose
being in there ;
i would like to have seen mom be the villain .
i am sure
she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there.king triton held none of the respect
he had earned from me in the first movie ,
and do not even get me started on scuttle 
sebastian and flounder .
triton was a stern
but loving father in the first movie 
and in the second 
it is almost like he is lost his will to knock fear into the heart of his subject .
scuttle 
once a comic relief
that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle-hopper '
( yes ,
i will admit it ;
i did call my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time after that ) .
in this film 
scuttle 's all but forgotten .
a supporting character even in the first ,
he at least added something to the movie .
he was rich with a flavor the other
did not have ,
and in the sequel 
they all but stripped it from him entirely .
sebastian was still the same 
but twice as worrisome as before .
disney 
do not do that .
do not even try to mess with our favorite crab .
or our favorite little fat fish ,
who becomes a dad
and has a multitude of very annoying child .
he is fat ,
and he is bland ,
and he looks like he is going to flat line any second.the walrus and penguin were unneeded ,
and after a while 
you just start to resent everyone .
especially melody ,
who has no depth to her whatsoever.and one of these day 
disney ,
i am kicking out of my life.if i did not love your original so much .
