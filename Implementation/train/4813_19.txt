there are two reason
why i did not give a 1 to this movie .
one reason are some of the actor
( like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh )
work ,
who tried to play at their usually good level of acting .
however at many scene
they were somehow
blocked by the bad scripting.the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg ,
which is quite different to most other such role i
have seen so far.everything else in this movie is as bad
as it can be .
boring scene 
useless and boring dialog 
bad script work .
and it seemed
as it was the first movie ever for many actor .
it could have been an interesting story though ,
but they failed completely .
