i love this movie .
as a kid 
this was one of the first movie i saw
that made me flinch .
sure 
it is mild now ,
but back in the day 
it was awesome .
dentist are one thing
so many person fear ,
so why not do a movie about a killer dentist ?
it is cheesy ,
it is fun ,
sometimes it is scary ,
but it is awesome .
and i have always had a love for medical horror .
and corbin bernsen play dr. feinstone perfectly 
no one could have done it better .
and for a low budget horror film 
the effect and such are quite good .
and i also love the theme music ,
it goes well with the film .
ken foree
( dawn of the dead )
is also in this one playing a nosy cop ,
and does a fine job .
there is a fair amount of blood ,
and some really cool torture/death scene .
check this one out !
