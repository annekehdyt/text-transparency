on 24 october 1955 
the hard-work geologist of the hadley oil company mitch wayne
( rock hudson )
meets the executive secretary lucy moore
( lauren bacall )
in the office of her boss bill ryan in new york
and invites her to go to a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon kyle hadley
( robert stack ) .
on the way of the meeting 
he confesses
that they had traveled from houston to new york
to satisfy the wish of the reckless kyle ,
who is his best friend since their childhood ,
of eating a sandwich from club 21
and the meeting was just a pretext to kyle 's father jasper hadley
( robert keith ) .
mitch and kyle immediately fall in love for lucy ,
and kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress lucy ;
then he opens his heart and proposes lucy .
they get married and travel to acapulco
and the insecure kyle stops drinking .
meanwhile 
kyle 's sister marylee
( dorothy malone )
is an easy woman
and has a non-
corresponded crush on mitch
that sees her as a sister .
one year later 
kyle discover
that he has a problem
and might be sterile
and starts drinking again .
the jealous marylee poison kyle telling
that his wife and mitch are having a love affair .
when lucy finds
that she is pregnant ,
kyle believes
that the baby belongs to mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy .
`` written on the wind '' is an overrated melodramatic soap opera 
with artificial character and situation .
there are at least two great movie with character with drinking problem :
`` the lost weekend ''
( 1945 )
with stunning performance of ray milland and `` day of wine and rose ''
( 1962 )
with awesome performance of jack lemmon .
robert stack has a reasonable performance
and his character 's motive for drinking are shallow and clich\u00e9s .
in the end 
the forgettable `` written on the wind '' is entertaining only
and never a feature to be nominated to the oscar .
my vote is seven.title
( brazil ) :
`` palavras ao vento ''
( `` word in the wind '' )
