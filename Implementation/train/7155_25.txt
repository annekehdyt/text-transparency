and it began the swashbuckler craze
which throve in the french cinema in the 1955-1965 years.it made gina lolloigida a star

`` fanfan la tulipe '' is completely mad ,
sometimes verging on absurd .henri jeanson 's witty line -full of dark irony- were probably influenced by voltaire and `` candide '' .antimilitarism often comes to the fore : ''

when necessary
( joy of life and joy of death ) '' ''

but no matter 
let 's wait for the next time .
`` a voice over commants the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride :

christian-jaque directs the movie with gusto
and he knows only one tempo :

but i do not think
