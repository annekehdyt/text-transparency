this truly funny movie has a zany cast of character 
just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in hollywood ,
and a touching 
funny love story .
the capomezza 's and the malacici 's are rival caterer in an italian neighborhood in new york .
they are also at opposite
-- extreme --
end of the taste scale .
their child are cast in the lead role of a church production of romeo and juliet .
naturally 
they fall in love .
on stage !
the mayhem and confusion
that this causes ,
as the parent feud with each other and their kid 
is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza 's magnificently tasteless home ,
and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings.besides the four over-the-top parent and the charming young lover 
the character include a vaguely wise priest 
a plain-speaking grandma 
a lady
who waves a wand and pass on spiritual advice
she receives from a medium
called the blessed roscoe 
a motel with bed shaped like the back seat of a car 
and two dove .
there is not a sight gag or a punch line
that does not click in this fast paced movie.even
the family name of the two family are part of the fun .
`` capomezza '' could be interpreted as `` low-ows 
''
and `` malacici '' could mean `` stuck-up snobs . ''
if you are sensitive about italian stereotype ,
you may not like this movie .
if bette midler embarrasses you ,
you may not like it ,
because all of the woman in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart .
the rest of us should love it !
