if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of altand # 305 ; oklar ,
as it is promised by the tag line ,
you will be very disappointed to see
that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of altand # 305 ;
oklar
regarding most famous issue like sex 
marriage and cheating .
to much nudity ,
which seems to appear from nowhere
and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves
that altand # 305 ;
oklar was unsuccessfully to `` try something new ''
as he has quoted .
to much sex centered joke seems to show that altand # 305 ;
oklar had fallen for the famous saying
which is `` sex sells . ''
i was hoping to see a very good story
told with a very good narration technique .
however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minute and watching altand # 305 ;
oklar 's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .
