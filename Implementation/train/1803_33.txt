there is nothing new for me to say :
4 hour of person dying over and over in the same hill .
the cast was stellar ,
but unfortunately the producer/director/editor/god goofed .
he should have eaten humble pie
( if not for his own sake then for the man
who died in kargil ) ,
hired one of these illiant bollywood director ,
hired a real scriptwriter ,
hired a real editor ,
hired a musician
that was not related to him in some way
( and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of `` apocalypse now '' on some cheap indian drug ) ,
hired a real professional crew ,
thrown away all the firework
and told a real story .
unfortunately he 
like the bigwig of the indian army 
made decision
that were terrible for his actor ,
and terrible for his audience .
we all died over and over .
please do not do that again 
sir !
sushma kathmandu 
nepalps :
next time an indian director decide to glorify the gurkha regimant ,
i suggest
he hire more than one nepali
to represent the team .
surely there are plenty of nepali man
working in bombay
-- last count was 40,000 to half a million .
