i may very well be one of the few
who really stuck to this film .
i also saw this movie
when it came out ,
and i agree with the last post
that up the acedemy was way ahead of its ' time .
the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine .
i do not see why mad stand behind this feature .
it was also one of the few film of the early 80 's to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave band
that were emerging from l.a. at the time .
i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day .
what can i say ?
there are definitely worst movie out there .
i do not consider porky 's to be as funny as up the academy ,
there are some really good laugh throughout the film ,
and the joke fall on either stereotype or getting laid .
hey 
nobody said
this was going to be the maltese falcon .
