i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature
when i lived in new york .
it was a pretty creepy movie ,
though not as good as horror hotel .
i just bought this movie on dvd ,
and it is different from what i remember
because in the dvd
that i bought there
are several scene
where the actor speak in french and/or italian and no subtitle are provided .
then the other actor respond in english to what was being said .
kind of weird .
also on the dvd box ,
the name of some of the actor are spelled differently than on imdb.aside from that ,
this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothe off
and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth
( barbara steele )
to make out with her
by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resist .
that scene existed in the tv version ,
but it was very edited .
i wonder
if there is any extra footage
that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition ?
it seems sad
that some of these old low budget classic have been spliced to bit
and sold in all kind of edited version .
where are the master tape and all the unused footage ?
aside from the first boring twenty minute
before allen is delivered to the castle ,
the rest of the movie is pretty good .
there are not too many special effect
( but herbert 's face after julia club him is a good one ) .
the creepy atmosphere and the strange 
exotic 
and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better
than it should be .
i can honestly say
that
if barbara steele had not been in this film ,
it would be a big zero .
she makes the movie a ten !
