i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto .
this film was sort of a consolation
when i thought
i would not be able to get in to see my first choice .
well 
i was totally blown away .
by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie
( yes 
i actually forgot
who was even in it . )
terrific performance from the entire cast .
carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her day as trinity .
as for billy connolly 
i think
not since chaplin has an actor played so illiantly with no line what-so-ever .
the kid were also great .
definitely check this one out
if you get the chance.and ,
by the way ,
i got to see my first choice anyway-
and this was way better .
