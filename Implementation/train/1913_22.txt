some person have made a point of dissing this movie
because they question the plausibility of black person in the old west 
asian person in the old west or woman with gun in the old west period .
get a grip
and read a book .
there were quite a few asian
( chinese ) ,
there were quite a few black
( freedman )
and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to gun ;
it is the second amendment you know .
and as far as the use of modern language goes 
none of those western person have waxed nostalgic about actually used language
that was consistent with the era depicted .
american had different accent ,
used different inflection ,
spoke at a very different pace
and used plenty of word and phrase that would be unrecognizable today .
do not blame historical inaccuracy for the fact
that you just did not dig it .
be honest .
maybe you are just uncomfortable with what you are seeing .
