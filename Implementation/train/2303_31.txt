too many source routinely lump this thought-provoking period drama in part based on historical
fact together with the superficially similar `` nunsploitation ''
which was a mainstay in '70s euro trash cinema ,
overlooking the righteous anger
that drives the whole endeavor .
perhaps coincidentally
it was also director gianfranco mingozzi 's singular attempt at narrative film-making outside of many well-received documentaries.safely set within a historical context ,
flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun
( florinda bolkan 's career performance ,
even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci 's devastating do not torture a duckling ) ,
locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt
to curb the girl 's budding sensuous nature .
wondering
why woman are relegated to secondary role at best in life as in holy scripture ,
she is confronted by way
in which male domination can rupture female life 
inspiring revolt
fueled by the ranting of semi-crazed older sister agatha
( indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casar\u00e8s from marcel carn\u00e9 's les enfants du paradis )
and - more constructively - by a muslim invasion .
joining the oppressor and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding ,
flavia truly becomes the outcast
she already felt herself to be ,
with expected tragic results.with its eathtaking widescreen composition by alfio contini ,
who shot michelangelo antonioni 's zabriskie point ,
this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman 's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society
which allotted her no right beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remark .
a lengthy drug-induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell 's otherwise far more flamboyant devil notwithstanding ,
the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department ,
making something of a mockery out of its semi-porn reputation .
this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation .
