i went to see this a few day ago ,
and it is hard to forget that film ... for the wrong reason .
this film is supposed to be funny ,
it is not ,
not a single laugh in the theatre
( perhaps for jos\u00e9 garcia and g\u00e9rard depardieu ) ,
and it is boring 
boring 
boring .
it was even hard sometime to understand
what they were saying .
they just talk to fast
and do not open their enough for us to understand .
i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 time i caught myself saying after a line
that was supposed to be funny `` what ,
what did he say '' ,
and i am french .
i hate to say that ,
given the fact
that i think
good film are made here ,
but i apologise in advance for all foreigner
who will go see the film
( if ever shown outside of france )
.we are deeply sorry for that cr @ p. 2/10
