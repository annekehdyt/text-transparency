i have one word to someup this movie 
wow !
i saw `` darius goes west '' at the tribeca film festival .
person in the theater were sobbing .
this movie shows the hardship
that darius suffere with muscular dystrophy .
the movie was very well done
and really made you part of the movie ,
i was so emotionally moved by the movie
because it made us remember
that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy ,
some person in this world are less fortuate then us .
and sometimes we should give them a had and help them 
to the very end .
i would give them ten star ,
they gave darius a had
when they were not asked to ,
they did't do it for the money
they did it
for a friend in need 
darius ,
the world should know ,
darius went west .
