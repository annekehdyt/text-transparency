the movie is plain bad .
simply awful .
the string of bad movie from bollywood has no end !
they must be running out of excuse
for making such awful movie
( or not )
.the problem seems to be with mainly the director .
this movie has 2 good actor
who have proved in the past
that the have the ability
to deliver great performance ...
but they were directed so poorly .
the poor script did not help either.this movie has plenty of ridiculous moment and very bad editing in the first half .
for instance :
after his 1st big concert 
ajay devgan 
meets up with om puri
( from whom he ran away some 30 year ago
and talked to again )
and all om puri find to say is to beware of his friendship with salman ! ! !
what a load of crap .
seriously .
not to mention the baaad soundtrack .
whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy ?
ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar.only saving grace are the good performance in the second half .
ajay shine as his character shows his dark side .
so does salman as the drug addict .
watch it maybe only for the last half hour .
