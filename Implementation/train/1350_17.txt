just below the surface lies what ?
a simply awful movie is what.as other viewer have justifiably commented ,
the storm sequence are just plain ridiculous .
chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain ?
now that is smart .
menace ?
foreboding ?
sexual tension ?
for those read dull and contrived 
dull and contrived and dull and overly contrived.i want to say thank god for mia sara 's shower scene but in retrospect i think
the producer of the film ,
having seen the completed mess realised
that they had to put something in
to make it half way worthwhile at all .
so it just becomes yet another contrivance .
do yourself a favour
and give this a miss .
