just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim .
i agree with all the assessment
that make this among errol flynn 's greatest outing in a career of great outing .
i would think
this role
playing boxer jim corbett
is more like his real personality than the swashbuckler he was typecast as .
flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoir
and was one guy
whose real life was more exciting than his screen life .
the extra thing
i wanted to point out
is notice the great montage 
transition 
and still inserts
that punctuate the film .
although the director was raoul walsh 
a frequent collaborator with flynn 
with cinematographer sid hickox ,
the montage were made up by an up
and coming editor
named don siegel .
i never knew siegel went
that far back but he is listed right in the credit .
he would go on to a great career as action director himself .
