despite being told from a british perspective this
is the best ww ii documentary ever produced .
presented in digestible
( as digestible as war can be )
episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitude of eye witness
who were forced to live the event of that horrific time .
eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s. the european had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year .
