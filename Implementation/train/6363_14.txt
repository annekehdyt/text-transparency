i have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movie this summer
but was so disappointed about this particular film .
while some person walked out of the film ,
i decided to stay ,
only to laugh along with the other moviegoer at the acting 
lack of suspense 
ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line .
i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film .
the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack .
this is one of those budding star film
which they later regret doing .
in retrospect 
i would not even rent this one ,
let alone pay more than $ 5 to see .
