i love the series !
many of the stereotype portraying southerrner as hick are very apparent ,
but such person do exist all too frequently .
the portrayal of southern government ring all too true as well ,
but the sympathetic character reminds one of the many good thing about the south as well .
some thing never change ,
and we see the `` good old boy '' every day !
there is a lucas buck in every southern town
who has only to make a phone call
to make thing happen ,
and the storybook `` po ' white trash '' are all too familiar .
aside from the supernatural element ,
everything else could very well happen in the modern south !
i somehow think trinity ,
sc must have been in barnwell county !
