mild spoilersin the near future 
arnold star as ben richard 
a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man ' 
a deadly tv game show
where person have to keep moving
to try and escape utal death at the hand of the 'stalker ' .
of course 
person are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold
to prove
the system wrong.i have not read the stephen king book ,
but this is a great film regardless 
one of arnold 's best .
he does what he does best in the action man role ,
delivering death with unforgettable one-liner .
classic are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck ' after strangling a guy with barb wire ,
and 'he had to split !
' ,
referring to whereabouts
he just chain sawed someone vertically .
dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter ,
and all the 'stalker ' are suitably camp .
the action is violent ,
but its an action film .
that is the point .
the film is fast paced ,
and at 90 minute it does not overstay its welcome .
with starky and hutch 's paul michael glaser at the helm ,
and made in the wake of the success of the terminator ,
previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold 
and very far fetched .
but today 
anyone
who watches a lot of tv
could see
how the film is getting closer to reality .
i would not be surprised
if i turn on the tv in the 'near future '
and see a show not to far from this.on
that depressing note 
i must however recommend 'the running man ' to anyone
who likes the 80s 
arnold 
ridiculous act or violence or just a good action film .
9 .
