this was a highly original decent movie ,
and a ave move for all those involved .
i do not care
if it is not the most well put-together movie of all time ,
the fact
that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic ,
and that i do not know
what will happen next ,
makes it a favorite of mine .
i wish more movie were as imaginative as this one 
rather than the same old formula for entertainment .
