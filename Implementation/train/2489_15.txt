all dog go to heaven play on the canine criminal underworld .
the film is a delight for child with a comical and dark-but-satisfying and happy-ending storyline with plenty of song and dance .
it features outcast charlie 
a fellow canine criminal
who is murdered but return from the dead .
he meets a homeless human girl
who looks up to him ,
and through this relationship ,
he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice .
this is a cute animation loved very much through my eye as a child .
i would highly recommend this film to child .
i am unsure about how adult would react to it .
( i tried to watch it a few year ago on vhs ,
but those recording do not last long ,
do they ? )
