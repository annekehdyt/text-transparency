i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review
but in this film there is really not much to talk of .
just a mish-mash of other far better sword and sorcery epic .
lack of cohesiveness run rampant
as does banality .
even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other
then a loincloth is pretty boring
as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.mildly amusing
in it is ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it is worst .
lucio fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here
and it shows.my grade :
d- dvd extra :
poster and still gallery ; lucio fulci bio ; and us and international theatrical trailer eye candy :
saina siani is topless throughout
( some may consider that appealing ,
i did not ) ;
various extra are topless as well
