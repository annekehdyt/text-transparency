damn 
i have seen this movie for at least 4 time
now and i still do not get bored watching it.the visual are so good and together with the music
which is totally awesome
and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me.the cgis are quite bad imho ,
but the whole visual with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interior were just ... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie .
the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable ,
the plot is so good.however although ,
the movie had little flaw 
like e.g .
sometime i thought
the movie was a bit too `` slow '' ,
but i do not mean the scenic part by that 
i totally loved those.also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story ,
like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps ,
where all their datum is saved ,
and has this conversation with the guy down there ...
but that may also just be me :
d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized ,
they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and `` louder ''
but then again
without all these flaw
the movie would have been so good i
would have never stopped watching it again and again ...
