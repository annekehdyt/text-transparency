unfortunately 
this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original .
nicholas cage 
fairly wooden as far as actor go ,
imbues the screen with a range of skill from 
non-plussed to over the top .
the supporting cast is no better.the plot stays much the same as the original in term of scene progression
but is far worse .
not enough detail is given
to allow the audience to by into what
is being sold .
it turns out
it is just a bill of poor good .
disbelief can not be suspended ,
nor can a befit of a doubt
be given .
the only saving aspect of this film is
that it is highly visual 
as the medium requires ,
and whomever scouted the location should be commended.there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos 
literally 
at the end.disappointed !
wait for the original to come on television ,
pour a whiskey and enjoy .
