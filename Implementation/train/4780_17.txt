i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time .
the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension 
especially when landing 
yet the specially effect
when the krell attacked were awesome for a film
that was made over half a century ago !
living in the middle east i saw shade of islam creep
in when jj adams suggested
alta should dress more modestly ,
and as an engineer 
was amazed by the imagination
used for the 'futuristic ' gadget ,
and gizmo dreamed up by the prop department .
all in all 
an entertaining hour and a half 
my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance
to see leslie neilsen as a 'young ' man
