every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror ,
diamond are crafted ,
and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer illiance .
this is no less than a diamond ! !
this is a film imful of eeriness 
chilling anticipation 
and dark atmosphere ,
and i think
it is safe to say 
one of my favourite horror film of all time !
and of course it contains probably the single most ,
flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror !
every time i see the film ,
and it gets up to the point
where you know
the inevitably will happen ,
i try to remember exactly
when i will be frightened out of my wit ,
but it never fails to happen ;
i never get it right ,
and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it ! !
now 
it must be said ,
to scare a jaded horror fan like that ,
that is nothing short of pure perfection .
unlike the american 
the brit know their subtlety ,
they take pride in the art of acting ,
they do not need any special effect
in order to convey atmosphere ,
they rely on the power of the potent story ,
and the creepiness
( in this case )
of suggestion and anticipation .
every single element is impeccable 
from the set piece 
the acting 
the story 
to the menacing atmosphere .
pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper ,
that is for sure ! !
as an end note ,
if you for some demented reason do not like this piece of insanity ,
then you honestly
do not know
what horror is all about ,
and frankly do not deserve to know it either .
thank you !
