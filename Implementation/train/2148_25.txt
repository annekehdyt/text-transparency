my title just about sums this heap of crap up i should have taken a hint
when i saw
it was a fred olen ray movie -
but i thought 'hey ,
it might be better than his usual rubbish ' boy ,
was i wrong !
this has to be the worst movie
ever targeted at child .
the acting was awful ,
the humour was non-existent ,
the direction was the worst i
have ever
seen
and the special effect would not seem out of place
on a 1950 's disney movie.what has happened to dee-wallace stone !
who once had such a promising career in the 80 's .
movie veteran and former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad-guy
and the budget was so low
it was a totally unbelievable
even as a kiddie movie.i have not seen the sequel
made in 1999
and nor do i intend toif
you want a good kid movie watch 'honey i shrunk/blew up the kids/kid ' or any disney moviemy rating as a 19 yo :
- 2/10rating as a kid movie :
- 3/10 at the best !
