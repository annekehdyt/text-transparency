i will admit ,
i thought
this movie was not going to be any good
but i soon changed my mind .
the movie was keep you guessing
as which direction it is going .
pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man ,
who suddenly becomes burned out
and asks a man
he met at a mexican bar for help .
greg kinnear is an awesome straight man 
as his role as a mild mannered man from denver ,
who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar .
the movie will have you laughing
as pierce deliver hilarious one liner
( mostly about sex )
.the imaginary in this movie is very well done 
especially at the bullfight scene
and when pierce sees himself
when trying to finish his last job .
