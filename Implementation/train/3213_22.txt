take a pinch of goodfella ,
mix it with the godfather ,
add some roman mythology and plenty of lowow comedy ,
and you have the soprano ,
about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey .
it is almost as entertaining as pro wrestling .
i am not the biggest fan of this show ,
but i do admire jame gandolfini 's very complicated tony soprano 
a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience .
i also have come to admire te contribution of folk like gravel-voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior 
silver-haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous 
tough-as-nails carmela soprano .
the violence is sudden and graphic 
the body count steadily climbs each season ,
but it is often the small moment
that matter most here .
watch paulie and tony 's nephew christopher
( michael imperioli late of law and order )
as they get lost in the pine barren
and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck ,
both convinced
they have had it .
