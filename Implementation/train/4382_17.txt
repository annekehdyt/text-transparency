this is a typical `` perfect crime '' thriller .
a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ,
ignoring all the clue ,
immediately knows
who guilty is .
the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty
to be caught .
the result is like every single episode of `` columbo ''
or `` murder she wrote '' .
the director himself refers to the hackney story
by showing the police officer
watching an episode of matlock !
this story barely fills up 90 minute
but the director insists on using all 120 minute
filling with every cliche in the book .
skip this one 
you are not missing anything .
