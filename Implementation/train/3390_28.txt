greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman 
nina foch ,
( julia ross )
who is out of work
and has fallen behind in her rent
and is desperate to find work .
julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper
looking for a secretary
and rushes out
to try and obtain this position .
julia obtains the position
and is hired by a mrs. hughe ,
( dame may witty )
who requires
that she lives with her employer in her home
and wants her to have no involvemant with man friend and julia tell them
she has no family
and is free to devote her entire time to this job .
george macready ,
( ralph hughe )
is the son of mrs. hughe
and has some very strange desire
for playing around with knife .
this was a low budget film
and most of the scene were close up
in order to avoid the expense of a background and cost for scenery .
this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england
and there is secret door and plenty of suspense .
