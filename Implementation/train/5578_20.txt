i was duped into seeing this movie
after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p.o
'd ! ! !
it took me at least 15 minute to pick it up off the shelf b/c i
did not want anyone to see me .
then another 10 minute
to build the courage
to take it to the counter
and actually use real money to rent it .
i thought
that all my stress would pay off by the time i
got home
to and watching the movie b/c the review i read said
the movie was a pleasant surprise ;
what a joke !
if you can make it through the first hour of the movie
then your in luck !
b/c it is not until then the movie turn 's into a horror .
do not bother with this one folk 
your better off watching `` dankness fall ''
