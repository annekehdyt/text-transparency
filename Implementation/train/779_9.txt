i think
the biggest disappointment in this film was that 
right until the end 
i expected the acting instructor of the cast to eak in and apologize for how poor the acting was .
when you consider the powerful subject ,
the illiant scenery and the effort made
in creating a wonderful set and spectacular image ,
it is a shame
that little attention was given to acting .
