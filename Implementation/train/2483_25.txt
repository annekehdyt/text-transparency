though the plot element to `` the eighth day ''
seem like they have been done plenty of time ,
the film still has much of the spark 
mystery 
and symbolism
that jaco van dormal 's first film had .
though not as good as `` toto the hero '' ,
which will always remain on my favorite list ,
the movie still leaves us with lot of emotion .
daniel auteil 
from 2001 's flavorless `` the closet '' downplays his part 
afraid to overact
( rightfully so ,
the role could have easily been ruined
if the actor was overly dramatic ) .
however 
i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it ,
focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character 's growth.do not walk into this movie
expecting the dark humor and unexpected twist
that you got from `` toto the hero ''
because you will be disappointed .
however 
the film still serves as a decent 
if not flawed ,
movie
