( aka :
blood castle or scream of the demon )
*spoiler*this was a drive-in feature 
co-billed with the velvet vampire .
a spanish-italian co-production where a series of woman in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count
named yano dalmar is seen on horseback ,
riding off with his 'man-eating ' dog behind him.the townsfolk already suspect
he is the one behind it all
and want his castle burned down .
the murder first began around the time count yano ' older other ,
count igor dalmar was horribly burned
and killed in a lab accident.then a woman ivanna
( erna schuer )
that igor hired
before his death to assist him in his experiment shows up .
yano agrees to hire her in place of his other and together
they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cell .
yano wants to ing igor 's charred corpse back to life.but of course igor is still alive
( although horribly burned )
and stalking and killing the woman in the village .
we see his char-oiled face appear at various point in the film ,
so we know
he is still alive ,
making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious.igor meet another fiery end
when he gets into a fight with yano over ivanna ,
with the burning candle falling on to the same bed
that igor stumble on to 
meeting yet another ,
final char-oiled end.the retromedia dvd is taken from a vhs source
and looks quite grainy and bad .
other than an even scratchier trailer 
no other extra are included .
although it has a nice 
creepy spanish castle and good atmospheric ,
i found it to be fairly boring and predictable 
with no excitement or mystery 
whatsoever .
3/10 .
