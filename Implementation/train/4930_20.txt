although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death.i have never read the comic book

and decided to give it a chance.the animation
was ok ,
i got the sense of the 80 's anime from it

was fine .

who do not like it ,

cause everything person have bashed this can be said about everyone favorite anime vampire hunter d
