it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive
( maffia-like )
character of russian 
or at least of those russian able to travel outside their big country ;
that it is too easy to rob a bank in england ;
and that british police is so inefficient
that it can not find the person
who robbed the bank
even when these subject are leaving the country by air .
in addition 
nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleague spoke a language
not yet identified anywhere ,
probably spoken by alien in the ural mountain ,
but far to be the russian one .
so nicole ,
if you really want to talk russian ,
kindly go to moscow or st. petersburg
and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation .
