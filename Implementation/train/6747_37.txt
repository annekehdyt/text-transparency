i watched this movie recently together with my sister
who likes the performance of sophia loren .
i am a person
who they call a cultural barbarian .
i hate art in any kind of shape or form .
rambo is more my kind of movie 
action 
kill 
blood 
horror .
if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague .
no one dies 
no action 
no nudity 
nothing of the kind .
let me give you a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a few sentence .
it starts out with 5 minute in black and white nazi propaganda .
every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler 
except for a housewife 
an anti fascist and a caretaker .
the housewife who is cheated by her husband ,
meets the anti fascist .
she falls in love with him ,
wants to make love to him ,
but the anti fascist is gay .
despite of this they make love with each other .
at the end of the day 
the housewife reads a book from her gay lover ,
and the guy himself is deported by agent .
the end .
you want an even shorter r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ?
boring ... that short enough ?
the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself ,
to save the audience from this atrocity .
on a side note my sister loved this movie .
like i said ,
i am a cultural barbarian ...
