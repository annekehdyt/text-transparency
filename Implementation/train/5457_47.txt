a bunch of woman
who can not act sit around 
talk 
smoke pot .
they have another woman in a wheelchair
they hide
because she is deformed ,
and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh
that really looks like some store-bought ham
which they dressed up
by sticking on a few plastic finger .
we do not see them killing anyone ,
suddenly there is a body on the floor ,
covered by a bloodied sheet .
i can not eat spam cover by a sheet anymore
because of this .
just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough
to induce the same narcoleptic fit ought on
by trying to get through all of this movie .
occasionally there are randomly inserted scene of a guy
who is `` hunting '' them by way of torturing some guy
he strapped to a chair
is his basement .
why he caught this guy
and how he is connected to the sit-on-the-couch sister
is never explained .
there are also scene of some `` superhuman '' guy freaking out .
he p***es blood and punch through a wall ,
but
who he is or what is wrong with him
is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.there is no action 
no special effect 
no story .
if you want to watch some boring person talk in a profound way about nothing
while sitting around and eating ham and smoking ,
then here is 90 minute of that ,
because 
except for a scene
where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scene ,
absolutely nothing happen .
( yawn )
oh 
i almost forgot ,
you get to see them move some stuff ,
including the deformed sister ,
when they move to their new apartment .
its one of the few time they are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed .
