as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless .
tv told a lot of ly about panhandler in the early 1990s
and made everyone look bad ,
and claimed
we all made over $ 100 a day
when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality .
when someone drove
by where i held up a sign offering
to work ,
and offered me work ,
i actually went
and took the work
if i was physically able.and
if i would been offered the $ 100,000 id damned sure
invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 year ,
and kept most in the bank and still left myself $ 10-20000 for nl $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash game at the casino .
i usually always win
and could win decent
if i just had a bankroll .
instead i win about $ 1000 a month
is all playing in always minimum
buying in due to not wanting
to risk
losing it all .
i was only homeless cause i did not wan na risk
spending all my money and going oke ,
sometimes i had over $ 1000-2000 in my sock
while i slept outside .
anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit
i was different than most homeless person though 
due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drug .
im no longer homeless ,
am now in govt housing for $ 177 a month
and getting ssi
and spend most of my time winning at online poker .
mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi .
glad my day of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping 
worrying
about getting
caught by security
are finally over .
had this tv crew
picked me theyd been over a lot sooner .
its a shame how they do not better select
who they pick .
