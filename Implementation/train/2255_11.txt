dull 
cheap sci-fi thriller 
made with an almost total lack of conviction
( a control room full of computer and other device
used to receive and decipher message from outer space
is run by only one man ,
and is very poorly guarded at night ) ,
and full of campy sound effect .
christopher lee is not only wasted ,
but he also gives one of his few `` i am here strictly for the money '' performance .
( *1/2 )
