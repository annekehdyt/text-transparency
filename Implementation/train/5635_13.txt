tintin was one of my favorite hero as a kid .
i used to borrow the book from the school liary every chance
i got .
my favorite one was `` the red sea shark ''
- so much action and humor.this documentary was a illiant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin .
the film-maker 's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist
who was the inspiration for the chan character
was very moving.a great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist .
a great example of someone
who has become internationally renown ,
and has ought joy of million of child
( and the young at heart )
all over the world .
