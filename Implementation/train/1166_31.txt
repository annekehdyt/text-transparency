anyone
who has said
that it is better than hostel is talking complete crap ,
believe
me i am not a fan of hostel
but this is just ridiculous .
this is just another shot on camcorder 
straight to dvd 
low on idea waste of your time ,
i can not believe
how many of these film there are and i am yet to see a decent one .
in the 80 's video nasty 
gore and horror movie were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new idea and most importantly the heart and soul of the director
who had something to say .
now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick person owsing in blockbuster to rent a copy ,
until person stop doing this then i guess
these film will keep appearing .
this film is so low on idea
it is just amazing
how it ever got made ,
the acting is also terrible ,
the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief .
this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it ,
unless you are on a quest to compile a list of the worst movie of all time .
my best/worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them
if
they do not back off ,
you can see
that she is not even covering the trigger with her finger
just holding the grip .
an absolute joke .
