so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode
because this is the one episode i definitely remembered .
i enjoy watching the first season and yes
compared to the action packed show
we have now this show seems lame .
but frankly i like the `` less violent '' part of the show
and the story line has more substance than the new one now .
i thought
it interesting
that belisario 's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor
( hawke and harm )
both are looking for an mia relative
( other 
father ) .
wonder
if robert belisario 's personal life mimic these 2 show ' theme.question -
does anyone have picture of hawke 's cabin .
i love that cabin
( kinda like a dream cabin of mine )
and that is one of the scene i
remember about airwolf .
