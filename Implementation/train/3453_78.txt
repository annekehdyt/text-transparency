outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between dad authority and their hope and dream .
the period is captured ;
the bakelite light swithe 
the georgian floorpan 
the picture rails 
the wall paper 
the short skirt 
the cheeky lads 
the mini van 
shiny modern mangle ... . the location is captured ;
a wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape 
wall of local stone 
community 
freedom .
but there is much much more ;
childhood 
happiness 
sensuality 
pride 
value 
freedom 
authority 
rebellion 
violence
( in the deepest sense ) ,
love 
struggle 
puberty 
naivety 
morality 
trust 
faith 
deceit 
machismo 
manner 
maturity 
loss 
poverty 
sacrifice 
horror 
acceptence 
revelation 
comedy and parenthood are all there .
( and in no particular order ! ) .
this film is a richly woven expression of family tension
that are as relevent today as ever .
the fact
that some of these are not tackled directly
is testament in itself to the attitude of the day
but the fact
that they are all here
is a testament to the acting skill 
the story and the direction .
if there is anything bad about this film ,
it is that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end .
maybe i missunderstand - the doom and gloom
felt by many teenager really does disappear
if they deal with it
( ** ) - maybe the film is trying to send
even that message too - well worth doing .
what is the film trying to say ?
kid :
parent were young too 
parent struggle too ,
everyone makes mistake ,
everyone learn 
thing change ,
struggle can end happily .
parent : do not try too hard !
try to remember
that your support is the key to their well being .
it sounds simplistic does not it ?
sometimes the film feel like that too
but it is then that you notice
how much is being being challenged and uncovered .
the film is a classic .
( ** )
- not the problem themsleve .
