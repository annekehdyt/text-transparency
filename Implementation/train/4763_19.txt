all the folk
who sit here
and say
that this movie 's weak link is the ramone
would probably say
that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist .
rock and roll high school was centered around the ramone .
how anyone can watch this
and not get a kick out of joey ramone
eating bean sprout backstage in an attempt
to keep him in performing condition
is obviously a wet blanket square daddy-o .
ms trogar ,
exploding white mice ,
the hall patrol ... instant classic .
nevermind the riff randell character.if you do not like the ramone
then you do not know rock and roll
and you do not deserve to watch a movie
called rock and roll high school .
