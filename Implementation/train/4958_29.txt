`` i am curious :
yellow '' is a risible and pretentious steaming pile .
it does not matter what one 's political view are
because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level .
as for the claim
that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc-17 ,
that is not true .
i have seen r-rated film with male nudity .
granted 
they only offer some fleeting view ,
but where are the r-rated film with gaping vulvas and flapping labia ?
nowhere 
because they do not exist .
the same goes for those crappy cable show :
schlong swinging in the eeze but not a clitoris in sight .
and those pretentious indie movie like the brown bunny ,
in which we are treated to the site of vincent gallo 's throbbing johnson 
but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny .
before crying
( or implying )
`` double-standard '' in matter of nudity 
the mantally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between man and woman :
there are no genital on display
when actresses appears nude ,
and the same can not be said for a man .
in fact 
you generally will not see female genital in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica .
this alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability
to come to term culturally with the inside of woman 's body .
