i just watched the movie i
was afraid
it is gon na disappoint me .
i was rather surprised at the end though .
the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movie of all time .
yes 
it will not be true if i say
that i enjoyed it as mush
as i enjoyed the original one .
beta house along with the previous two py definitely lost something
that the first two py had.it is not gon na become a classic
as the first two already did .
but what the hell-it is still funny with a lot of good moment
and i think
it should be the first movie
to pick
if you wan na have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school .
beta house deserves 6/10
but i gave
it 7/10 just for being another slice of pie .
