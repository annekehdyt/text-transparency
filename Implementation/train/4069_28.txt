my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven ,
is the fact
that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minute in the trial scene .
and the trial itself 
imo 
is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lover ,
but it is roger livesey
who gives the liveliest and most credible performance .
french accented marius goring is a delight
( he even gets in a remark about technicolor )
as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven
when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight .
goring has some of the wittiest line
and deliver them with relish.seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so year ,
i think
it is a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for film .
the technicolor photography 
somewhat subdued and not garish at all 
is excellent and the way
it shifts into bandw for the heavenly sequence is done with great imagination
and effectiveness.the opening scene is the sort
that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspect of the story
-- and niven 's tense talk with radio operator hunter
while his plane
is crashing toward earth ,
unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter .
truly a marvelous film from beginning to end 
another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger .
