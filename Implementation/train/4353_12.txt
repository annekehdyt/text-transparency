we ought this film as a joke for a friend ,
and could of been our worst joke to play .
the film is barely watchable ,
and the acting is dire .
the worst child actor ever used
and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance .
the plot is disgraceful
and at point we was so
bored we was wondering
what the hell was going on .
it tries to be gruesome in place
but is just laughable.just terrible
