they filmed this movie out on long island ,
where i grew up .
my other and his girlfriend were extra in this movie .
apparently there is some party scene
where they are all drinking beer ,
( which they told me
was colored water 
tasted disgusting ,
and was very hard
to keep swallowing over and over again 
especially in the funnel scene ) .
yet none of us ever heard of the movie
being released anywhere in any form .
it never came out in the theater
( obviously )
and it ,
as far as i knew 
was never released on video ,
and i am sure was not released on dvd .
yet it looks like
it was seen by some person ,
albeit it probably very few .
so there must be something .
i would absolutely love to purchase this for my other ,
yet there is no way
i can find it anywhere .
does anybody know
anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased ?
and which format
that would be ?
