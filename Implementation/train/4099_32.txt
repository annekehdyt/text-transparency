sudden impact is a two pronged story .
harry is targeted by the mob
who want to kill him
and harry
is very glad to return the favour and show
them
how it is done .
this little war puts harry on suspension
which he does not care about
but he goes away on a little vacation .
now the second part of the story .
someone is killing some punk and harry gets dragged into this situation
where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret
that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet .
the police chief is not a subtle man
and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble .
this is harry callahan trouble follows him .
the mob tracks him to this town
and hell opens up
as harry goes to war .
meanwhile the vigilante strike again
and the gang having figured
it out is ready for her .
jennifer spencer is caught
and harry comes to her rescue during the film 's climax .
sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry
but at the time it gives us a harry
that is very much an anti hero ready
to go to war
just to pursue justice .
again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line .
go ahead make your day .
