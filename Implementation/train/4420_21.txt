it was simple and yet so nice .
i think
the whole sense of sex segregation in society ,
which can be bitter ,
was shown very delicately .
it had a bitter kind of hummer in it .
the fact
that most of the actor were not professional ,
made the movie more tangible and more realistic .
there was a `` documentary '' side to the movie too .
the best scene were those
that all the girl 
banned from watching 
were listening passionately to the soldier ,
who is supposed to keep an eye on them 
oadcasting the game .
if you are an iranian ,
the familiar cheering and dancing in the street after a game won ,
fill you up with national pride ! !
if you are not iranian ,
you will still love it all the same !
