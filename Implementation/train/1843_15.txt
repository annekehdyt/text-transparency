i came across this film by accident
when listing all the film i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i
was on holiday and i am so glad
that i included this one .
it deals with issue
that most director shy away from 
my only problem with this film is
that it was made for tv so i could not buy a copy for my friend !
it is a touching story
about how person with eating disorder do not necessarily shy away from everyone
and how many actually have dieting buddy .
it ought to my attention
that although bulimic can maintain a fairly stable weight ,
it has more serious consequence on their health
that many person are ignorant of .
