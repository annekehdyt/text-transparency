this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlight of the 1st season
where a holodeck malfunction trap captain picard 
beverly 
datum 
and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930 's san francisco setting .
this episode is an homage to raymond chandler 's `` maltese falcon ''
where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat .
the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey 's `` maltese falcon . ''
this episode also iefly introduce us to a mysterious insect race
called the jarada
that communicate with mostly a high-pitched buzzing sound .
communication with this alien race is difficult ,
and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue
so that negotiation and diplomacy can finally begin .
the best part of this episode 
though 
is the appearance of the famous hollywood b-actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock .
he was such a handsome man back in the 1940 's .
oh 
well ...
