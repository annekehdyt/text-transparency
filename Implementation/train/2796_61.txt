i think
the majority of the person seem not the get the right idea about the movie ,
at least that is my opinion .
i am not sure
it is a movie about drug abuse ;
rather it is a movie about the way of thinking of those genius other ,
drug are side effect ,
something marginal .
again 
it is not a commercial movie
that you see every day
and if the author wanted that ,
he definitely failed ,
as most person think
it is one of the many drug related movie .
i 
however 
think
something
else is the case .
as in many movie portraying different culture 
audience usually fully understands movie portraying their own culture 
i.e .
something
they have grown up with and
are quite familiar with .
this movie is to show what those `` genius '' person very often think
and what problem they face .
the reason
why
they act like this is because they are bored out of their mind : )
they have to meet person
who do mediocre thing
and accept those thing
as if they are launching space shuttle on daily basis .
they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time .
they feel
like- i went to work ,
did nothing ,
still did twice as better as the guys around me
when they were all over their project ,
what should i do now with my free time .
and what is even more boring ?
when you can start predicting behavior
not because you are psychologist ,
but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past .
so 
for them 
from one side it is a non challenging job ,
which is also fairly boring sometimes ,
and from another they start to figure out person 's behavior .
it is a recipe for big big boredom .
and the dumbest thing are usually done
to get out of this state .
they guy earlier
who mentioned
that their biggest problem is that
they are trying to figure out life in term of logic
( math describe logic ) ,
while life is not really a logical thing ,
is actually absolutely right .
