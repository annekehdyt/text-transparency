one of the worst movie i ever saw .
my only thought was :
`` how can i get my money back from hollywood video '' .
this is no way worth four dollar 
or any dollar .
i think
it was an attempt to rip off the mexican 
or vin diesel 's movie ,
but it failed miserably to do this.the acting was terrible ,
i felt sorry for the actor
that they could not find something better to do with their time .
the story was ridiculous .
we were calling out the line ahead of the actor ,
it was so predictable .
the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated 
worse than a cartoon .
skip it .
