there are some thing
i will never understand ;
why underwear comes in pack of three
when clearly thats not enough is an example .
similarly 
i will never understand this film ,
and that is illiant .
if you approach this film expecting an actual movie ,
you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug ;
although that may well be possible
if you greet this film 's satanic figure .
take pitch for instance ;
the most ineffectual 
camp 
unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined force
to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horn covered with condom .
however 
it does create some of the most hilarious moment of any film ever .
seriously 
this is no understatement .
the same can be applied to every other character ,
bar the little girl
who acts so sickly innocent
she is probably overcompensating for some serious crime
she is part of .
then again ,
if santa 's inter-space recon station is real ,
there is no chance
she could have avoided him this long .
put simply ,
if you have not seen this movie ,
you can not consider yourself a serious buff .
the achingly funny characterisation 
acting 
concept 
and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date
( if you are after pure laughter
that is ) .
