just because someone is under the age of 10 does
not mean they are stupid .
if your child likes this film you would better
have him/her tested .
i am continually amazed at how so many person can be involved in something
that turns out so bad .
this `` film '' is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else .
the writing is horrid .
i can not remember
when i have heard such bad dialogue .
the song are beyond wretched .
the acting is sub-par
but then the actor were not given much .
who decided to employ joey fatone ?
he can not sing
and he is ugly
as sin.the worst thing is the obviousness of it all .
it is as if the writer went out of their way
to make it all as stupid as possible .
great child 's movie are wicked 
smart and full of wit - film like shrek and toy story in recent year 
willie wonka and the witch
to mention two of the past .
but in the continual dumbing-down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo
( yes ,
that is right ) ,
the recent charlie and the chocolate factory and eye-crossing trash like red riding hood .
