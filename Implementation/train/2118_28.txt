kristine watts
( molie week )
is oken apart ,
missing her lover ;
she is not able to overcome her love for him
that is lost in the past .
she hires a stranger
( douglas davis )
and gives a list of her mistake to him with thing to fix .
but time is irreversible
and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end.the first point
that impresses in `` the cure '' is the stylish cinematography
that alternates black and white with color .
the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minute .
the soundtrack is beautiful
but the volume is a little loud
and associated to the fact
that english is not my native language ,
in some moment i needed to repeat some word whispered by the narrator .
the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance
and is extremely gorgeous .
i hope to have a chance
to see her again on the screen .
last but not the least ,
the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better .
my vote is nine.title
