i really enjoyed this movie .
most of the review have been bad ,
but most critic think
a movie should be like an idea drama .
this movie has a little bit of drama ,
but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining .
forget about julia robert being a pretty woman ,
emma robert is a beautiful young lady
and there is more to her than just that .
emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew .
it is good to see a new face .
i believe
she will go far.nancy drew may not be based upon the book ,
but the story is still good .
there is also a good blend of other character actor
and supporting actor like pat carroll 
barry bostwick 
rachel leigh cook and chris kattan - not credited .
i am surprised
disney did not release this movie .
some person may not like this movie
because it does not contain sex 
violence 
and cursing .
this is a good family film
which is rare in this day in time .
so take your family ,
see this movie and judge for your self how good it is .
i can not wait for the sequel .
