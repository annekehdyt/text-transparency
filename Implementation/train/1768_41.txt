with lot of sunshine 
gauzy light and shadow filtering through window and into room ,
tracking shot moving through crowds with hand-held camera 
quick-paced editing and extreme close-up here and there ,
the photography is the thing in this interesting ,
artistically done film.the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest .
the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool ,
where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu
( played by louise brooks )
- a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking man by poolside ,
she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest 
much to the chagrin of her very jealous 
stick-in-the-mud fianc\u00e9
( a pretty annoying fellow 
really ) .
strutting down the runway the ten contestant display themselves in swimsuit ,
while the winner is chosen as the contestant
who receives the longest applause
( i was wondering ,
could not the girl just walk slower
to prolong their length of time -
and thus applause - on the catwalk ? ! ) .
lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja ,
but her hot-headed beau does not like the attention paid to her by other man or her adoring public 
for that matter
( i guess
he just wants her in his house 
cooking his meal ,
and staying out of sight 
eh ? !
) .louise brooks is beautiful and charming ,
her presence helps enhance this film ,
but it is really the way
it is photographed
that held my interest the most .
a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound ,
which is a bit off .
the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though .
watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problem and watch the film visually ,
and i found the movie to be excellent ,
well worth seeing .
