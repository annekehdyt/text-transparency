this is definitely one of the weirder 70 's movie out there ,
and it is most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria .
it is also notable for the little touch of insanity throughout the movie ,
especially when the dark 
moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all thing
( as another user pointed out ,
one of the song is dedicated to a character 
travis crabtree ,
who paddles around in a canoe for a while ,
then ... leaves ,
never to be seen again ) .
although it is painfully dated now ,
i 's still a fun scary movie
to show to kid ,
and anyone
who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70 's hillbilly culture
is bound to get a kick out of this .
my favorite part : a guy gets so scared
that he jumps headfirst through a door
( ! ? )
and the narrator explains he went unconscious from `` shock . ''
uh 
i would say
eaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious 
but whatever.4/10 star 
or 7/10
if you like bad americana .
