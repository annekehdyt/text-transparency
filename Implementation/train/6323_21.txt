i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film
where being over the top was not the goal .
his character is like all of us .
wanting more - better thing to happen to us
and expecting god to deliver.morgan freeman
made a great god .
with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation
when the opportunity presents itself.i thought
jennifer aniston 's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding toward carry 's basically self-centered tv anchorman wanna-be
but that is the way
it was written.i think
the preview ruined several potentially very funny scene
because everyone
who saw them knew
what was coming
before it happened.i have read a number of the review
and it seems some person are looking a little too deep .
this is a summer comedy
and is not meant to solve the problem of the world
although there are a few message
we could all take to heart.a funny film .
