this movie should not classify as cinema .
although it is over 10 year old now ,
it should never ,
ever have gotten funding ,
and is a blight on the australian film industry ,
which is now producing such illiant film as `` the dish ''
the actor can not act ,
the music is..
to be blunt 
not music ,
the storyline is completely nonexistent
and is a struggle
to sit through.do not watch this film .
it is a complete waste of your time .
