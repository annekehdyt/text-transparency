i remember watching american gothic
when it first aired ,
it came into my mind recently ,
all i could remember was the same guy
appeared in midnight caller ,
which is gary cole ,
i do not watch much tv ,
but i watched american gothic ,
i purchased the complete series on dvd this week ,
and it is still as good as ever ,
this is one of the best tv series ever ,
the reason
i do not watch much tv
is because it is just rubbish
that is on 
except for derren brown 
it is all reality tv or soap 
such as grease 
big brother etc 
i am fed up with it ,
i got the complete series of american gothic for \u00a316.97 form the asda website ,
that is the cheapest i can find it .
