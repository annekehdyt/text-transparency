i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930 's romance .
boy meet girl ,
they fall in love 
boy losis girl ,
boy wins her back in the end .
it was not like that at all .
clark gable play con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyeow raising .
he is hiding out from the cop
when he bursts into ruby
( jean harlow )
's apartment ,
to find her covered in bubble in the bathtub 
no less .
instant chemistry.she play hard to get for a while ,
but a girl can only resist that grin for so long .
the heat between them is evident ,
and there are some scene
that are definitely pre-production code !
when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for `` troubled girls '' ,
she is miserable and 
thank to the ragging her roommate gives her ,
begins to believe
that eddie will never come for her .
harlow play the hard-nosed ,
fast talking ruby perfectly .
she never lets gable get all the good line !
there is an especially moving scene with her playing `` their song '' on the piano
that is acted perfectly .
the last fifteen minute have me crying every time .
a truly sweet romance .
