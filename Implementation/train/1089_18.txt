a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemploymant from a middle class `` artist '' with a comfortable upinging ... it is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemploymant directly
and certainly has no personal experience of it .
if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story 
unemployed man of all age behave like teenager ,
have no anger 
no fear 
no frustration 
etc .
all the character live trough the day
by carrying prank 
boyish joke .
they do never look for work ,
the do almost never experience rejection or anguish 
etc .
living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school ... ridiculous .
specially
if you compare it with contemporary masterpiece from the like of ken loach 
etc .
