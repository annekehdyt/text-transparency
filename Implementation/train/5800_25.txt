up until the last 20 minute 
i was thinking
that this is possibly jackie chan 's worst movie
( excluding his pre-1978 work ,
which i am not familiar with ) .
the final fight sequence changed all
that :
it is long and good and intense - indeed 
one of the highlight of chan 's career .
but to get to it ,
you have to sit through a lot of `` comedy ''
that might amuse five-year-old
( oh 
look !
someone threw a tomato at that guy 's face )
and endless `` football '' scene .
not to mention the dubbing
( which includes the line
`` how can i turn it off ?
it is not a tap '' - watch to find out what it refers to ) .
`` dragon lord '' is worth renting for the final fight alone ,
but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collector ,
and even then only for those
who 've already seen at least 15 of his other movie .
