first thing first 
the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed .
now actress wang zu xian 
the one
who played xiao qian in the movie ,
is 42 year old and well aged .
it is always good to review these glorious time
when seeing
old-school hongkong production like this.the movie is one of the most influential title
made in 1980s .
the art set decoration
and other aesthetic facet are all mesmerizing .
more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it .
it feels like a horror movie
but ultimately it is not scaring ,
but only fun.i had the experience
of translating the second script of `` a chinese ghotst story '' ,
and i thought
that script was a decent write .
however
when i saw the movie ,
i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script 
like in a smaller scale
and involving more comic role .
however 
it turned out to be better executed in term
of being entertaining.if
you have seen the lord of the ring ,
you will notice the similarity in this movie to lotr .
the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch .
it is definitely a laugh-out-loud .
bravo !
