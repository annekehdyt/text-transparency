strained comedy 
a sketch-like revue
which was initially a vehicle
to showcase one-time radio star jack pearl
but is now best remembered as america 's introduction to the three stooge .
actually 
larry 
curly and moe are billed alongside comic ted healy as ted healy and his three stooge .
although the supporting cast feature jimmy durante
( who is completely wasted on dim material )
and zasu pitts 
the only audience for the film these day are stooge-addicts ,
and even they will not find much to applaud here .
incredibly loud and overbearing 
it shows
how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication .
*1/2 from ****
