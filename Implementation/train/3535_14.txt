super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system .
the imax camera puts you right in the race car ,
where you cruise around various track at high speed ,
reminiscent of the driving sequence in grand prix
( if only that would appear on dvd ! ) .
i enjoy watching it again
and again.the only minus ,
and why i did not give it a 10 ,
is some of the driving sequence
look suspiciously like the film was speeded up .
the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief -
all you can hear in a real car
is the engine .
you will not hear swoosh as you go under idge .
