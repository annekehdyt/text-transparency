this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway
but it is close .
that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book .
this director 's film of 3 i have seen
i find them all to be miserable .
like the cook ... ,
whatever positive cinematic flourish
he displays ,
are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation .
