this is the best emma in existence in my opinion .
having seen the other version
( 1996 )
which is also good ,
and read the book ,
i think
i can safely say with confidence
that this is the true interpretation
and is the most faithful to jane austen 's masterpiece .
the 1996 movie with g. paltrow is good too ,
it is just that it is almost like a different story altogether .
it is very light and fluffy ,
you do not see the darker edges of the character
and if you just want a pleasant movie ,
that one would do fine
but the intricacy of some of the plot point 
such as the churchill/fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent .
but if you want the character fleshed out a bit 
more real and multidimensional ,
the 1996 tv version is the superior .
emma is a remarkable person ,
but she is flawed .
kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirk of the character .
you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith ,
yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet 's proposal until
that action has the effect
of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending .
you see her narcissism
and it mirror frank churchill 's in that they would do harm to other
to achieve their own aim .
for emma 
it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend
to while away the time
with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage .
for frank churchill 
it is securing the promise of the woman
he loves
while treating her and other abominably
to keep the secret .
in the book 
she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunder
she has made .
both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse
but paltrow 's is more childlike and stagnant
while beckinsale 's awakening is rather real and serious
and you see the transition from child-like 
selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult .
both version are very good
but i prefer this one .
