i would not be so quick
to look at all the good review
and say
this might be a good show..this show is only good
if you do not know what `` talent '' is..i will not even say
how offensive it is ( i know
it can be offensive to a lot of person ) because that not really what bothers me about the show.. what bothers me is that person watch this
and think
it is funny..it makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and i am actually scared that it will one day be run by person who watch this garbage..basically the plot is simple..it is about an offensive 
self centered 
spoiled woman
( sarah silverman )
getting through everyday life..that it..like
that has not been done a million times..in fact almost every joke
either has been done or is racist..sarah also likes to sing..i like her voice..that it..not the lyric..the lyric are dreadful..which
she likes to sing about a lot of things..if you like to see a hot woman
put everyone else down
and make them feel like crap
while at the same time farting
and saying
crap about every race then this show is for you..
