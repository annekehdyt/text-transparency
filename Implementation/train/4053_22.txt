the selection of sylvester stallone
to perform the protagonist by renny harlin
is commendable
since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person
who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the character of rocky balbao and rambo .
but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.the excellently
crafted opening scene
introduces the audience to the thrill 
suspense and intrigue
which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws .
the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit
case from one plane to the other
is something
not filmed before.the biting cold of the snow capped alp
and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist force makes one shiver with trepidation .
the force of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.good movie are not made every year
and person do not get a feast for eye to watch every now and then .
apart from the filthy language/parlance
which endows azen excitement during certain scene ,
the movie can be regarded as one
that is not going to fade its captivating appeal
even watching it after so many year .
