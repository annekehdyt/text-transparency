... but the keyword here is `` usually . ''
i have been known to adore movie
everyone think are dumb .
but in the world of b-rated movie 
this one is z-rated .
absolutely ridiculous .
the thing i respect about most of my favorite b-rated movie are
that they do not take themselves too seriously .
the maker of movie like that sort-of treat the movie lightly ,
even if it is a heavy topic .
i get the impression 
however ,
that the producer of this movie took themselves way to seriously ,
like they were putting together a 10-star classic 
complete with poor attempt at poignant line and dumb camera shot .
nevertheless ,
despite all this ,
i still gave it 4/10 star ,
as i am biased toward movie like this .
if you are a b-rated fan 
however ,
i would try too hard
to find this one .
