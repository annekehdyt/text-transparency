bob clampett 's 'an itch in time ' milk seven minute of crazy action out of a very small premise .
elmer fudd tells his dog
that
if he scratches himself just once more
that he will be given a dreaded bath .
unfortunately for the dog 
a relentless flea makes it all
but impossible to stop from scratching .
the cartoon switch between the flea 's progress inside the dog 's fur and the dog 's desperate attempt to cope with it .
in a great sequence
that really captures the frustration of an itch
that can not be scratched ,
the dog change colour from own to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid !
it sounds ludicrously surreal
but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way
only clampett could .
there are several other element
which make 'an itch in time ' pure clampett .
there is the grotesque concept itself ,
which leads to some graphic scene of the flea munching on the dog 's flesh .
there is the unrestrained violence
that rears its head in any scene
featuring the cat .
most notably 
there is the dirty joke
including a huge shot of the dog 's behind
which causes the flea to wolf-whistle and a hysterical sequence
in which the dog attempt to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor .
he momentarily eaks off to address the audience :
`` hey 
i better cut this out .
i may get to like it '' !
with a very limited concept 
clampett manage to make 'an itch in time ' a unique 
minutiae-based cartoon .
like an early episode of 'seinfeld ' 
'an itch in time ' is practically about nothing
but very funny with it .
