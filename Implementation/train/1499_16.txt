dil was a memorable movie
that ing to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar .
the movie
followed with beta 
ishq 
raja and masti all of whom were superb.but then every successful director gives a few horrible movie alongwith some hit too .
pyare mohan is one such movie.though the comedy
are told nicely
but then they fail the viewer to laugh .
comparing with the kind of comedy movie
being made today this
is a dumb.if
you really want to watch a movie and laugh ,
please do not watch this .
because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.in short ,
the movie is worth a miss .
