i just saw `` behind bedroom door 
''
and this was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it
that i have seen in a while.we begin with two neighborly couple
-- vivian and jame fenway
( julia krui and eric carrington ) ,
and lillian and gabe harris
( nicole sheridan and chris gustafson ) .
vivian appears to be a housewife ,
jame is a lawyer running for district attorney ,
lillian work in real estate ,
and gabe is a successful plastic surgeon .
got all that ?
now 
let 's get into it.enter abby ,
played beautifully by porn star chelsea blue .
she is renting the house across the street from the fenway and lives all by herself .
at the beginning of the movie 
jame looks out his window
and sees abby engaged in playtime with her girlfriend 
gigi
( played by prolific pornstress monique alexander )
and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her .
the next day 
abby gets acquainted with all four of them ,
and appears to be a nice woman
who just happens to be living an alternative lifestyle .
she makes a pass at vivian ,
who seems startled
and says to her 
`` oh ... i am ... not that way . ''
everything seems okay ...
until the plan gets set in motionfirst ,
abby shows up at gabe 's office 
naked ,
asking gabe
if she should get a boob job .
this is where we get our quote of the movie : ''
tell me about gabe . ''
`` what do you want to know ? ''
`` is gabe happily married ? ''
`` i am married . ''
`` there is trouble ... ..let me guess .
your wife stay at home ,
and does everything you ask .
but 
she is a good girl . ''
`` yes . ''
`` she is not a bad girl ? ''
`` no . ''
`` does
that door have a lock on it ?
`` you know
what happens next ... .abby gets it on with gabe 
right there in the exam room .
after that 
she puts on a little show in her window for jame ,
who comes over and wastes no time
in having sex with her .
what jame does not know
is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivity
( it is so obvious anyway ) .
abby has sex with gabe again later ,
and this time gigi joins in to make it a three-way .
now that abby has something on both man ,
she requests $ 100,000 from each
in order to buy her silence .
not only could she ruin jame 's run for office ,
but she could destroy gabe 's practice.while gabe and jame wrestle with their guilt 
abby find time to seduce lillian
-- who `` experimanted '' with woman in college .
that was a long time ago ,
but you would not know
that seeing her in action with abby
-- she looked like an old pro.while gigi goes along with the plan ,
she is seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having .
`` it is only business 
''
abby says .
confession and apology are sure to follow ,
as is some startling info on abby 's true identity
-- it seems she is been doing the same thing to different man in many different place .
gabe and jame use this info to fight back against abby 's blackmail.now 
on to the sex .
the sex scene were pretty good ,
and considering all the woman
involved in this film
except for julia krui
have a lengthy porn background ,
i would not have expected anything less .
nicole sheridan 's four scene were the best of the movie ,
with the three-way coming in a close second .
monique alexander only got naked once ,
but she was a relatively minor character .
julia krui was a major character
and got naked the same number of time .
i suppose
since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pro ,
she did not have to have as many sex scene.to wrap up ,
`` behind bedroom door '' had a great storyline ,
which enhanced the overall grade of the film .
i consider it tapeworthy.woman :
a-
( nicole sheridan was good in this film
-- better than her later offering in fred olen ray 's comedy .
at least she can do drama somewhat .
chelsea blue was a scene stealer
-- she was not that bad as the antagonist .
i would give her an a all by herself .
julia krui was her usual self .
i wish
monique alexander had more face time in this film 
though .
) sex :
b
( solid 
very solid sex scene .
nicole sheridan 's performance were almost hardcore quality .
chelsea blue looked good in her scene 
too .
the two girl-girl offering were not scorching ,
but they did warm up the screen .
) story :
b+
( i liked the dialogue and the main storyline .
chelsea blue 's performance was good for the genre ,
and i was impressed with nicole sheridan 's turn at drama .
) overall : b
( this was a nice softcore flick .
i
am glad i
was able to watch this one ,
as i was pleasantly surprised .
if chelsea blue ever wanted to do more of these ,
she had be welcome anytime .
that goes for nicole sheridan 
too
-- even though she is probably better at doing comedy .
i do not mind hardcore girl
who can act doing softcore film . )
