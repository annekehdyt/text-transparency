the good :
effective color scheme .
good costume .
top notch set production .
well detailed cgi building and vehicles.the bad :
horrible mixture of actor with all cgi actor mixes fifth element with final fantasy .
the cgi actor look even worse than video game from a few year ago .
flawed logic .
a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it ,
no one really even question it ?
and there is no explanation
as to why the god horus was even cast out ,
nor was there any reason
why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jill ?
the ugly :
awful script .
so many unnecessary subplot with too many idea
that are not fully realized .
the dialog was almost laughable at some point .
random character and event
that are not needed .
dull character .
jill is supposed to be this mystery ,
but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer .
there is nothing to her .
she is uninteresting and boring to watch .
she has no substance 
no texture .
her character has no redeeming quality .
in fact 
there is not one character in the entire film
who has any purpose 
any goal
( besides the obvious one of horus ) 
any motivation .
they are weak and ill-conceived .
there are no stake
- the key to screen writing .
horus will not become immortal 
but 
big deal ,
he is a bad guy .
one can not even decipher
whether horus or jill is the main character .
that is the problem :
devoting half the movie to each character
means the writer never fully explores one character ,
never ings one to fruition .
they are cardboard cut-out
who walk around and talk
and pretty much do nothing
but explore the fine set piece .
first time director pacing .
slow 
slow 
slow .
i am still watching the movie as i write this .
i can not pay attention
because it is boring .
everything is flat .
even the action is not interesting
because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary.overall :
not worth a watch .
threadbare story 
sub-par character development 
corny cgi does not save the nice set production .
