the thief of bagdad is a treasure .
first and foremost 
it is a good story .
though my four child 's primary exposure to this tale 
the most famous of the story of the arabian night 
comes from the disney corporation ,
the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end .
the story moves along at a good pace
and includes a twist or two
that reduced predictability .
sabu ,
who plays the young thief 
abu ,
also measures up to any of today 's teen actor in appeal ,
judging from the number of time i heard my oldest daughter say ,
`` he is c-u-t-e ! ''
in 1940 
the film won oscar for cinematography and special effect .
today 
of course 
those effect seem very dated
( `` look ,
it is barbie flying through the air 
''
declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying ) .
yet they fit into the story well .
the film is 
after all 
over 60 year old .
the effect fit with the script .
furthermore 
what one sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five year .
one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode
to see this .
in that 
it was quite an achievement.this qualify as a family film ,
though there are a few stabbing near the end .
the acting is so obvious
and the wound so bloodless
as to those scene nearly as artificial as animation.all in all 
a fun film worth
watching for either an evening of pure entertainment 
or for the historical value of the effect .
i recommend it .
