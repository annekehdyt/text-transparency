as a matter of fact 
this is one of those movie
you would have to give 7.5 to .
the fact is ;
as already stated ,
it is a great deal of fun .
wonderfully atmospheric .
askey does indeed come across as over the top ,
but it is a great vehicle for him ,
just as oh 
mr porter is for will hay .
if you like old dark house movie and train ,
then this is definitely for you.strangely enough
it is the kind of film
that you will want to see again and again .
it is friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic reference
that made great wartime fare .
the 'odd ' band of character simply play off each other
as they do in many another typical british wartime movie .
it would have been wonderful to have seen this film
if it had been recorded by ealing studio .
a real pity
that the 1931 original has not survived intact
