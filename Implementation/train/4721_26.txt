bug life is a good film .
but to me ,
it does not really compare to movie like toy story and stuff .
do not get me wrong 
i liked this movie ,
but it was not as good as toy story .
the film has the visual 
the laugh ,
and other that toy story had .
but the film did not feel quite
as ... i do not know ,
but i thought
it was still a pretty good film .
a bug life ... i do not want to say this ,
is a film
that i do not remember .
i saw it year ago .
of course 
i have not seen toy story in year ,
but i still remember it .
i should not have reviewed this film 
but i am .
i am
giving it a thumbs up ,
though it is not exactly the best work pixar has done.a bug 's life :
