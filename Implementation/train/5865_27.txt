'mojo ' is a story of fifty london 
a world of budding rock star 
violence and forced homosexuality .
'mojo ' uses a technique
for shooting the 1950s often seen in film
that stresses the physical difference to our own time
but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion
( owing much to the way
that speech was represented in film
made in that period ) ;
i have no idea
if person actually spoke like this outside of the movie ,
but no film made today
and set in contemporary time use such stylised language .
it is as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriter serves a common shorthand for a past
that seems 
in consequence 
a very distant country indeed ;
and therefore stresses the particular 
rather than the universal 
in the story .
'mojo ' features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying one from aiden gillan and ewan bremner ,
the latter still struggling to build a post-'trainspotting ' career ;
but feel like a period piece 
a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom .
rather dull 
actually .
