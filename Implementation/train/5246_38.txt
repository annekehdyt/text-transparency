there are similarity and continuity with that series
but it is also very different .
in the pilot at least the science fiction element are definitely present
but are smaller part of this series .
the scene on caprica
while reflecting a more technologically advanced society
also have retro feel ,
this is achieved through some of the architecture 
the costume and the way
it is shot.while the look
and feel of the two series have some substantial difference
some of the theme will seem very familiar ,
religion is again very important here ,
while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg
is far more important .
we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul
and whether or not a machine can have one ,
as well as issue
related to crime and government.the pilot
has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv ,
the series is set
to start in 2010.like battlestar galactica this series
