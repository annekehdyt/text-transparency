how this film gain a 6.7 rating is beyond belief .
it deserves nothing better than a 2.0
and clearly should rank among imdb 's worst 100 film of all time .
national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence
and just yet another assault made on american audience by hollywood .
critic told of plot hole
you could drive a 16 wheeler through.i
love the justification for this movie
being good ...
`` nicholas cage is cute . ''
come on person ,
no wonder person around the world think
american are stupid .
this has to be the most stupid ,
insulting movie i have ever seen .
if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season ,
consider kinsey 
the woodsman 
million dollar baby or sideway .
national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific film .
i bet most of you
reading this
have not even heard of them ,
since some have not been widely released yet.nicholas cage is a terrific actor -
when he is in the right movie .
time after time i have seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing film like con air 
the rock and face-off .
when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufman 's adaptation
he is an incredible actor.bottom line -
i would rather feed my hand to a wood chipper
than be subjected to this visual atrocity again .
