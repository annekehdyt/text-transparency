i was looking forward to kathryn bigelow 's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscar
which it was awarded .
unfortunately
it really is not a good movie .
the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all count ,
but beyond that the story simply came across
as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard .
the actor put in a good effort ,
but for me i did not really get what the movie was trying to be .
it is not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket 
not as epic as band of brother ,
not as action packed
as ... well 
anything .
i certainly can not see why it was nominated for so much ,
nor why person are 'hyping it up ' to these epic proportion .
mind you ,
given the calie of movie in the last couple of year i suppose there is not a lot to choose from .
