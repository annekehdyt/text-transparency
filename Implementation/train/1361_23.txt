well 
i can once and for all put an end to the question :
'what is the worst movie
ever made ... ever ? '
it is flight of fury 
starring and co-written by steven seagal .
sure there are lot of famously bad movie ,
but this one takes the cake
in that it takes itself so seriously.it
is a romanian-made film
that speaks to just how far romania has to go
to catch up with bollywood .
it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become .
this movie is so bad
that you literally feel violated
after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry ,
knowing
that nothing will make you feel
clean again.it was released only on video
( i can not imagine why )
and i suspect the worker
that had to make the dvd 's
had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .
