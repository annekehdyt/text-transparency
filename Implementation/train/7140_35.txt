this ,
like murder
she wrote ,
is one of those show ,
that after a stressful day at school ,
i sit down in front of the tv 
and watch .
why ?
because i genuinely enjoy it ,
and it is a shame
it is not on the air anymore .
dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan 
a doctor-turned-detective ,
who with his son 
solves murder .
he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast 
namely his real-life son 
barry van dyke .
victoria rowell is also good 
but i noticed
that every series her hairstyle change .
i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter ,
but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman ,
and was puzzled
how he suddenly disappeared .
this show is so entertaining 
with great guest star ,
it is a bit obvious at time ,
like colombo 
but in every episode 
there is always something to chuckle about .
in conclusion 
a great series 
with two thumb up and a 10/10 .
