i am writing this 9 year
after the final episode was aired and i am
still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me.it has effectively gone
where numerous other cop drama have gone and succeeded .
but it took it further
and did not stray from the realism of the street 
often portraying life event and character down to a t.i am sorely missing this series ,
instead we have are given the stupid `` underbelly ''
which is over dramatised
and acted creating a whole load of american-esquire garbage.wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney
and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series .
the acting was a-grade
and it is a shame
to see only a few actor have furthered their career whilst other have faded into obscurity.i do not want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history ,
thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd 
not the first three .
give this series the ending it deserves .
