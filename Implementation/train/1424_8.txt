the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable
but towards the end it became trite .
although turturro is an actor i generally like ,
his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius
as a semi-autistic man was annoying .
overall it seems
as if this film is trying to hard
and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performance .
