there is an inexhaustible hunger for `` basic training '' movie ,
so it is surprising that this one got so little notice
when first released .
look likely to have a well-deserved second life on dvd/vhs.tigerland
is not uniformly great by any mean ,
there are some terribly cliched character
( especially the portrayal of the nco 's ,
makes you long for the return of lee 'full metal jacket ' ermey )
but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom .
charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get .
