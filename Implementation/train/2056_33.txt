this show is a great history story .
it is has everything from slavery 
the way
they were treated 
religion ,
the way jew were sent into hiding 
the inquisition 
the belief in the orisha the african god 
the way
woman were treated ,
including the daughter .
even down to homosexuality .
the way
the character are intertwined
and that violante ,
that character sadden me .
she is so desperate to be loved
that
she destroys everyone around her.i am so glad
they decided to re-release it to t.v .
again .
although i would love to see the unedited version .
xica has become my heroine .
i look up to the way
she uses her power
to help all
who seek it .
i love all the character
and have found
that they can relate to many person now in this century .
i look forward to my xica every night .
it would be great to dub it in english
so the american can love her too .
