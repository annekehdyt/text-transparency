i hired out hyid on the weekend .
what a disappointment !
a stupid lame attempt at a tele-movie .
the guy
they got for the lead
was totally weak
and when running { he did a lot }
looked like he was eating those minty sweet ... with his backside !
the wolf contact he wore were great ,
though i feel
the actor relied on them too much ,
as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all .
the wise native american indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard
faced hag ever seen .
talk about a sour cow !
she smiled about once for the entire film ,
and i think
that is because she had sex .
the sex scene was lame too .
they may as well have shown blowing curtain ,
if you can dig that.last of all ,
and this is a big pet hate of mine 
on the cover and the dvd menu ,
the loser digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy .
they were nowhere to be seen in the film .
