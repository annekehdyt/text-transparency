`` mechenoset '' is one of the most beautiful romantic movie i
have ever seen .
the name of the film can be translated in english as `` the sword-bearer '' .
the main hero
( sasha )
was born with one exceptional ability :
he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword
which emerges from under the skin in his hand .
at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal event and feeling .
but it is not about mechenoset .
he hardly can be even called the anti-hero .
i think
he is just a person
who lost the purport in his life and faith in good 
justice and love .
in his life he has never met someone
who could understand and love him
( except his mother ) .
every his step is stained with blood ;
he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him .
and suddenly he meets her .
she does not need the idle talk and explanation .
she loves him for what he is .
she does not care what he did .
the fact
that he is next to her is more important than anything else .
but soon she finds out his secret :
he kills two person
( her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard )
to protect her before her very eyes .
even after that she could not escape her feeling .
they try to run
but it is hart to hide .
finally they have a serious car accident .
he is caged ;
she is in a mental hospital .
they do not know anything about each other ,
but she believes
that he will save her .
he surmounts a lot of obstacle
but finally finds her .
they run again
but they are not invulnerable .
she is wounded ,
she needs a rest ,
but polouse almost catch them .
he does not know what to do ,
they drive into a corner ,
and then his sword begins to cut down tree ,
helicopter around them ,
but there is no need for it ,
because she is already dead in his arm ,
and he is the lonely person in the whole world again .
