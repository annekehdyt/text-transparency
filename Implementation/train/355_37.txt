when i had first heard of `` solar crisis ''
then got a load of the cast ,
i wondered
why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before .
then i saw it.now i know.for a movie
that encompasses outer space 
the sun 
vast desert and sprawling metropolis 
this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature ;
it feels
like everyone is hunkered close together
so the camera will not have to pull too far back.and the effect ,
while good 
are pretty underwhelming ;
we are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth
if a team of scientist and soldier can not deflect a deadly solar flare .
but other than shouting 
sweating and a red glow about everything ,
there is no real feel of emergency.do not get me started about the cast .
what heston 
palance 
matheson 
boyle 
et al are doing in this movie
without even bothering to act with any feel
for the material is anyone 's guess .
makes you wonder
who else 's condo are not paid for in hollywood ... .and as far
as the end goes ... . well ,
let 's just say
it is tense and intriguing
but it is too little too late in an effort like this .
if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film ,
maybe i would have heard of `` solar crisis '' sooner.two star .
mostly for lost opportunity and bad career move .
i wonder
how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this ?
