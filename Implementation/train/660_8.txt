rob roy is and underrated epic of passion and action ! some mild spoiler within .
liam neeson gives a towering performance as rob roy macgregor ,
one of the best in his career.jessica lange is letter-perfect
as his wife mary.they have the most passion
and chemistry i have seen in a screen couple.john hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.tim roth portrays one of the great screen villains.his rape of mary is repugnant
and harrowing.he really is a magnificent bastard in this movie.the final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best swordfight ever.well scripted an scored ,
and michael caton-jones direction is flawless .
10/10 .
