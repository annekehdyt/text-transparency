this movie is not good.the first one almost sucked ,
but had that
unreal ending to make it worth watching.this one has nothing.there is zero scare 
zero tension or suspense.this is not really a horror movie.most of the kill do not show anything.there is no gore to speak of.this could almost be a tv ,
except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence.the acting is not very good ,
either.and do not get me started on the dialogue.as for the surprise ending 
surprise 
there is not one.i suppose
it could have been worse ,
although i do not see how.but then again ,
it is less than 80 minute long ,
so i guess
that is a good thing.although
it felt a lot longer .
apparently this is the cut version of the film.i
found it for a very cheap price ,
but it still not worth it.if
you want the uncut more graphic version ,
check out the anchor bay edition.anyway 
this version of sleepaway camp ii :
unhappy camper gets a big fat 1/10 from me .
p.s.if you watch this movie ,
you will probably be a bored
and unhappy camper.if you are a real fan ,
you might want to pick up anchor bay 's sleepaway camp
( with survival kit )
three disc collection
containing the first three movie uncut and with special feature
