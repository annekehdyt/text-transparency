here is one you can watch with a straight face 
with a script so bad ,
even will ferrell would not be in it.there are two laugh in hot rod.1 .
the punch-dance .
rod `` needs to go to his quiet place ''
and
before anyone can say kevin bacon ,
he is footloosing a passionate 
overwrought bodyswerve to the strain of a band
who wishes
they had the big-hair faux-metal chop of europe.2 .
john farnham 's you are the voice .
in one of those epic sequence
where the star and his cohort do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heel in support ,
the soundtrack is the gag .
how did the film-maker even come across this aussie recording artist ?
a major australian vocalist
( and a genuine talent )
who shot to fame in the early '70s
covering raindrop keep fallin ' on my head ,
then disappeared
until 1986 for the big comeback with you are the voice ,
john farnham 's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy ,
it leveled mountain in switzerland.beside these two high point in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone
else 's vomit.andy samberg is rod 
a failed stunt jumper
who has never made a jump .
maybe it is got something to do with the fact
he is driving a moped into the heart of darkness .
or his fake mustache .
yeh 
someone actually thought
that was funny.without one jump under his starry belt ,
he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza -
which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian 
like jason bigg or rob schneider -
to win the day and save his stepfather
and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever ...
who watches these movie for plot anyway ?
along the way
( as usual for moronic lead in these comedy ) ,
he scores a saluious chick
( isla fisher ) ,
who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosome with this loser.sissy spacek
( carrie 
1976 )
has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance -
then changed her mind
and just hung up .
ian mcshane must 've lost a bet
to be here .
