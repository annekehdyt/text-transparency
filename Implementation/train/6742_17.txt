saw
it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des film du monde in montreal .
what a disappointment .
this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fan .
the acting was only but regular .
the directing did not ing anything new or interesting .
the plot lacks considerably :
the movie is all about those college grad and the game
they play making prank call
( 7eventy 5ive ) .
and on top of that 
you can predict the movie 's end in the first five minute .
if you like prank call and a slasher with an axe
that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie ,
you might like it .
if you do not ,
this movie is not worth it .
