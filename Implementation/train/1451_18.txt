gena rowland plays an actress
who loses her grip on reality
when she witnesses the death of a fan of her .
she becomes increasingly deluded from reality ,
and as a result her emotional turmoil intrude with her work as an actress .
in the sense
that she eaks all the rule of acting and improvise everything ,
yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting
( if a bit self-important )
as a parallel of cassavette ' own struggle as a filmmaker .
there is so many idea thrown around ,
and as result it becomes a bit muddled
( i am still pondering the relation between the dead fan and rowland 
among many other thing ) ,
but the way
they are presented in their rawest form
makes it a consistently interesting and thought-provoking film .
would be great on a double bill with mulholland drive .
