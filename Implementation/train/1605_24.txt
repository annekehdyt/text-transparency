let me start off by saying
that this does not seem or feel like a movie .
it seems like just another tv show about popular girl and boy with no real film language
top back
it up.the camera angle are so straight forward
that the story is told the simplest way
possible never making the public connect with it .
this film takes us to where no movie i have seen has done
before :
to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium
giving the public every element of interpretation .
too obvious .
the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv
from where we can see every attribute of these woman in a larger than life manner.lately
it seems
that young director are compromising the art of film
making for sale .
this is very scary .
the industry is spoiling the art in movie .
we must educate ourself and our child about what cinematography and its language are really about .
not just sale and entertainment 
but a way to communicate feeling 
passion and even culture .
not as a launching platform for young divas and jock .
