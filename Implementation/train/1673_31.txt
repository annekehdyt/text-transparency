i would almost give it 10/10 .
however 
there are some confusing part as well as section
that are miss-leading
which hurt the flow/continuity of the film .
the story line is great and well composed ;
you will definitely want to watch this quietly
to fully understand it .
the character are complicated
and so is the story line ,
expect to be given only enough information
to stop scratching your head ,
it is a film
where all is explained in the end .
the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film
that is unlike anything else
i have seen in animation .
it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scene
so it is worth watching it on a good t.v 
or plasma .
the character voice do save this film in its english version ,
but it would have been more convincing
if there were some french accent to emphasize
that its happening paris 
i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitle .
one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray
if they have it !
and personally
if you enjoyed this film
you might also like ; waking life and ghost in a shell 2 innocence ,
this is just a personal suggestion .
