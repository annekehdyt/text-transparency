this superb film draws on a variety of talented actor and musician at the top of their form - levant 
crosby 
martin 
rathbone 
manone are completely at home in the story
that apparently was supplied by billy wilder .
one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it ,
because it is an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile master/fertile servant tale - nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry 
run by dried-up numskull ,
but made into a viant world of art
and play by an exploited underclass of nobody and non-wasp .
looking at the last six decade of music 
tv 
and film in the us ,
it is hard not to see the underlying insight of this film as prophetic .
