it is interesting to see what shape pierce brosnan 's career was in
before bond arrived on the scene .
in this `` tense '' thriller 
pierce brosnan plays the gentle patrick ,
who works leading ghetto kid on `` confidence course '' .
he romances a woman ,
who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90 kid
called eric .
the woman 's drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene
and begins to mess with pierce.at one stage pierce is innocently making `` vegeburger '' .
the husband enter .
pierce resume making vegeburger .
the husband then assaults pierce .
little chunk of half-eaten vegeburger call fall from pierce 's mouth .
the fight auptly ends
without showing the outcome .
this is as good
as the film gets .
