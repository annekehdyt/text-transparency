i have personally seen many disney movie in my lifetime ,
though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomstick .
although i personally would not have crossed live-action with animation ,
it was an improvement on trying to dress person up as animation character .
the movie pits three evacuee from world war two
who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country .
i would have to say
that the casting was illiant .
angela landsbury made a perfect miss price ,
while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest .
ending always surprise me and this was no exception .
it was neither happy nor sad ,
though i do not know
if this was intentional .
the dialog was not great ,
but considering it was designed to be a kid 's movie ,
that is alright .
overall 
i would give the performance nine out of ten 
the dialog six out of ten ,
the casting nine out of ten and the costume eight out of ten .
