this movie was so great !
i am a teenager 
and i and my friend all love the series ,
so it just goes to show
that these movie draw attention to all age crowds .
i recommend it to everyone .
my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says :
`` rosy cheeks '' ,
when he is talking about his baby daughter .
he is such a great actor 
as well as erin cottrell .
they pair up so well ,
and have such a great chemistry !
i really hope
that they can work again together .
they are such attractive person ,
and are very good actor .
i have finally found movie
that are good to watch .
lately it has been hard for me to find movie
that are good ,
and show good moral 
and christian value .
but at the same time 
these movie are not cheesy .
