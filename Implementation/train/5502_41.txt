chan wook park is nothing if not inventive .
i am a cyborg
but that is ok is chock full of amusing little technical flourish with some ingenious idea
sprinkled in between .
attempting to walk in the footstep of the like of marc caro and jeunet
( city of lost child 
delicatessen ) ,
park embark on a fanciful 
lighthearted tale
which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare .
hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision ,
it is genuinely unexpected 
then ,
to see all park 's effort add up
to so very little.i am a cyborg
but that is ok seems astonishingly to subtract from itself
as it goes along ,
with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its part .
the premise is promising ,
gag are copious and offbeat humour abound
but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience .
the character are cute and quirky
and played with gusto by the cast ,
but ,
try as i might ,
i could not ing myself to care for any.sympathy for lady vengeance was a misstep ,
indicating perhaps
that park was overindulging himself a little bit ,
but it still managed to showcase some of the director 's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography ,
was readily forgiven .
none of the assured confidence
that commanded joint security area or sympathy for mr. vengeance is evident here .
i am a cyborg
but that is ok left me
so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time
( more regularly as the film progressed ) .
i gave lady a 5/10 ,
and by that measure 
this probably deserves no more than a 3. for old time 's sake ,
i will be generous :
4/10
