first 
i would like to say
that ,
while i know my share about star war ,
i am not a fanatic .
i do not know
how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 .
what i know is this :
star war 
all the movie
( less so with episode 2 though ) ,
captured something magical .
it is hard to say what ,
what button lucas has found and boldly pressed ,
but it works .
star war is more than a movie .
it is an idea.how ,
may you ask ?
i shall explain .
star war touches on the most universal of stereotype 
good vs evil .
it does this so obviously 
so profoundly ,
that literally any person from any environment can understand .
episode vi does the very well ,
concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father ,
yet also 
with the addition of the prequel 
reveal even more to the hinted back story .
suddenly 
it is darth vader at the front ,
and viewer realize
that it is the story about anakin 
not just luke .
but even before 1-3 
there was amazing depth to it all .
it felt real ,
as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas 's lap ,
detailing a historical account of a galaxy far ,
far away.star war is definitely something far above the norm ,
and i must admit ,
whenever i see them 
particularly this one 
i feel very small .
i feel
as though i have been thrust into a world where good
and evil are so clearly defined .
i get a tingling feeling
when i see them 
a feeling
that something 
somehow 
has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope .
