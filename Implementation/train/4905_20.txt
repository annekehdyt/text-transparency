usually 
any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass .
rambo :
first blood part ii was no exception to this .
the only movie
that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood .
this film is extreamly unrealistic 
and boring .
it has action ,
but not very good action .
i did not enjoy watching it ,
and i would never ever watch this again .
no wonder
why it won the razzie award for worst picture .
i would give this a 3/10 ,
the only reason
why it got the 3
was
because it had somewhat good action 
but not good enough .
