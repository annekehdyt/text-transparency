i thought
that ice age was an excellent movie !
as a woman of 30 
with no child 
i still seem to really enjoy these humorous 
witty animated movie .
sid is the best character
i have seen in some time 
better than bartok in anastasia
( although he was really humorous ,
and i did not think
that his character could be matched or even beaten )
and even more humorous than melman in madagascar .
i have seen the movie at least 15 time
( i own it obviously )
and i quote the movie at work
( on many occasion ... yes ,
still ) .
my favourite scene is the part
where sid says
`` oh 
oh 
oh 
i love this game ! ''
and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the `` tiger '' ... '' pack of wolf 
pack of bear 
pack of flea 
pack of whisker 
pack of nose 
pack a derm ? 
pack of ly 
pack of trouble 
pack a wallop 
pack of bird 
pack of flying fish ... ''
or however that part goes !
that is the funniest part about the whole movie ,
although i also really enjoyed the humour behind `` putting sloth on the map '' and many other part as well .
the only animated movie
that can remotely compare to ice age
is `` brother bear '' .
