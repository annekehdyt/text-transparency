i was utterly disappointed by this movie .
i had read some of the other review here
and had much higher expectation .
i expected a drama with more intense character development .
but that never happens in the movie .
daniel-day lewis is a good actor ,
but not as good as some reviewer here would have us believe .
i tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movement in the movie .
i would rate his performance 6/10.acting :
6/10 direction is 5/10 .
script is the worst :
2/10 .
i deleted the movie from my dvr at 70 min .
into the movie .
much better movie out there than this ...
