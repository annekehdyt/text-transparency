my first full heston movie .
the movie
that everyone already
knows the ending to .
a `` sci fi thriller '' .
the campy factor .
everything
that goes with this movie
was injected in my head
when i rented it ,
and on the morning
that i watched it ,
it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood
that i was in ( not wanting to move .
put in player ,
hide in blanket ) .
and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending
that will be eternally ruined by pop culture ,
it just really did not make it .
everything was all over the place ,
relationship had no backbone ,
the ending had no lead in .
everything was just kind of there in some freakish way
and the watcher has no choice
but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending
that it gets to ,
because
even though we all know
that it is person ,
it is quick answer as to why it is person makes any serious attempt
at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window .
