utter dreck .
i got to the 16 minute/27 second point ,
and gave up .
i would have given it a negative number review
if that were possible
( although 'pissible ' is a more fitting word ... ) .
unlike the sizzle you could see
and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original ,
the chemistry between dumb ol ' dicky crenna and whats-her-face here is just non-existent .
the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky acelet ?
there is no ciggy-lighting-by-fingertip ?
and i thought
i would be sick
when they have a mortified-looking
( and rightly so ,
believe
you me )
lee j. cobb as keye practically burping/upchucking his way through the explanation of his `` little man '' to mr. garloupis .
no offence to the non-sighted ,
but it looks as though a posse of blind man ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff house .
the same goes for those horrid plaid pant
that phyllis wear .
and crikey 
how much $ $ does neff make ,
that he lives overlooking a huge marina ?
this 
folk 
again 
all takes place in the first 16 and a half minute .
if you can get through more of it ,
you have a much stronger constitution than me ,
or you are a masochist .
but please 
take some alka-seltzer first ,
or you will develop a `` little man '' of your own
that may never go away .
proceed with caution 
obviously .
