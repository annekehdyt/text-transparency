1st watched 11/7/2002 - 2/10
( dir-john bianco ) :
pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in brooklyn
who like to say four-letter word a lot and kill person .
the only thing of interest here was their attempt
to show the fed being a lot like the gang .
this is the only attempt at good film-making .
the rest of the movie was predictable 
and cheaply-made .
the quality of the photography on some of the scene inside bar and floozy joint almost made you think
there was a problem with your dvd player
because of the bad contrast and some of the actor were hard to hear at time
because of the bad sound .
the acting was pretty-much characature of all your favorite gangster from better movie with corny name like vinnie `knuckle ' and jimmie `tattoos ' ,
and the plot pretty much followed those pattern as well .
so 
go see a better gangster movie
before you put your money out for this one .
