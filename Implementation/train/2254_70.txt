i am a huge fan of say anything 
jerry maguire 
and almost famous
( i was not that big on single ) ,
so it is safe to say
that i look forward to anything
that cameron crowe attaches his name to .
i went to see vanilla sky
having been told
that it was a very weird movie
and that i probably would not like it
if i was expecting anything similar to crowe 's other film .
well ,
having just seen it ,
let me say
that the former was correct ,
and the latter could not have been more wrong .
it is a very weird movie ,
and nothing really comes together until the end .
anyone
who tells you
that they saw
it coming halfway into the movie is either lying
to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory .
anyway 
the movie was stellar ,
and i look forward to owning it as soon
as the dvd is released .
i was moved by the film ,
and felt emotionally spent by the end .
this is an experience
that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion ,
if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot .
in the theatre
in which i saw the movie ,
there were more than a few person
who clearly lost track of the movie
and were bored by it
when they found
that they were unable to get back into the plot .
i am sure
other just lack the ability
to properly follow any movie like this .
i do not mean that to sound pompous ,
but some person are more cut out for the seagal 
chan 
van damme genre of movie ,
and these are the type
that probably would not enjoy this movie .
it is very cereal ,
so make sure
you are prepared for a two hour mental bender ,
as well as much thought afterwards.as far as comparing this film to other crowe movie ,
it is very similar in at least one regard ,
in all crowe movie 
the soundtrack is a character unto itself .
this is almost definitely due to crowe 's longstanding ty to music 
as anyone
who has seen almost famous know ,
and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson .
it was also worthy to note
that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise 's acting and crowe 's directing
that made the movie seem familiar to anyone
who has seen jerry maguire .
in my mind 
that is not a bad thing.anyway ,
if i had to compare this movie to any one other film ,
i would say this :
if you enjoyed david fincher 's the game ,
you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky .
