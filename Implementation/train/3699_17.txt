i realize
it is not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow-paced show
if they are interesting
but i find myself completely uninterested
and bored with this series.the formula for bsg seemed to be :
action + adventure + scifi + suspense + mystery + dramathe formula for caprica seems to be :
bland drama + moderate scifimaybe
it will get more interesting
but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it .
in fact 
it is at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week .
this is a sad state of affair .
the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup .
whatever happened to the glory day of sg1 
stargate atlantis 
and bsg on friday night ?
they had a good thing there .
