having watched this movie on the scifi channel ,
i can only conclude
that this film was made by a bunch of amateur
who have never seen a movie in their life .
the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrence 
or `` delight '' as the friend
reading over my shoulder
is telling me .
the plot is not really worth commenting as ,
but basically a plane carrying football player crashes into yeti territory .
before the movie is over ,
we are treated to yetis ripping heart out 
yetis waddling in an effort
to run
before jumping 50 meter ,
yetis ripping a man 's legs off
and beating him with them 
a woman
killing a rabbit at 30 meter with a javelin 
a yeti surviving several bullet
and being set on fire with no apparent harm ,
a yeti dangling off a cliff
by holding to a man 's shoe ,
yet then jumps off 
and a whole collection of further 
bizarre occurrence .
basically ,
if you are not staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose
of watching the worst of scifi channel original movie ,
avoid this film like the plague .
or as my friend reading over my shoulder says :
`` it is the best movie i
have ever seen . ''
to which the friend on my right says :
`` only battle techno music could have made it better . ''
