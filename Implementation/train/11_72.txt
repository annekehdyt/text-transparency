this movie should be shown to film school student as an example of what not to do .
the original kicked some major tire squealing butt 
this horrible disaster eaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer film ,
which is :
we all know
they suck ,
but they have great action .
this film has no action .
this film is boring .
where are the car ?
where are the chase ?
where is the tension ?
where is the suspense ?
where is the rush ?
where ! ! ? ?
this is not really a movie at all ,
it is a bad commercial .
50 car in 24 hour ?
that is wrong .
they have 3 day to steal them ,
the ad is wrong .
how bad is that ?
the lead acting is stiff 
wooden and forced .
the villain 
the cop 
the other ...
who cares .
they utter their pointless line ,
they serve the illogical plot .
they slog through it the best they can as the music video director
says
`` do not worry
we will make a lot of fast cut
and no one will notice
how bad the film is ''
or `` we will fix it with lot of loud music ''
the `` script '' is not really a script at all ,
it is more like a list of clich with an ending
that is a total ripoff of : -- -- -- -warning - possible spoiler -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 4 -- -- -3 -- -- -2 -- -- -1 -- -- --
the fugitive .
the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jone ,
man ... .this is the baddest 
coolest mofo since jule in pulp fiction .
and what do they do ! ?
they make him a mute
who 's hardly in the film !
make vinnie the main villain
and he could have saved the film .
how could they have been so dumb ?
how ?
how ?
why ?
the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end
that gets the driver away .
the original has a great 40 minute chase
that delivers !
go find the original .
or if you are craving some real car chase action go rent ronin .
the chase in ronin raised the bar
by which all other car chase will now be judged .
bruckheimer and cage had all that money 
all those resource 
all that experience ,
and they can not even come close to matching a film made 25 year ago for $ 250,000 ?
how can that be ?
you feel
like you got ripped off after seeing this movie .
where i was once excited to see coyote ugly ,
remember the titan and pearl harbor ,
now i say :
god help us all .
