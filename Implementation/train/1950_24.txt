madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past .
his next film page 3 was one of the worst movie of all time .
it apparently tells the story of some high class person in india .
after seeing a scene
where the man forces another man for sexual reason to star in a movie .
i felt like spitting and eaking the dvd .
coincidently i did .
the reason
why was the movie
contains scene of child pornography and molestation .
i literally vomited
and was shocked to see a movie showing naked child .
very disturbing stuff 
there was no need to show the child fully naked .
one of the rich guy like to kidnap poor child
and sell them to foreign person ,
british man in this movie .
i am shocked to know
this film was a hit in part of india 
otherwise super flop in uk 
usa and australium .
i am from uk ,
and this kind of stuff makes me sick ,
should not of been released in uk .
