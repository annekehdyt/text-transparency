this is actually an insult to the victim and their family of the btk killer .
the event in this movie are not even close to the truth .
why they could not make a movie of the real event
does not make any sense
since the real event are more interesting
then this made up farce .
do not even waste your time
watching this for free .
low budget and a shameful depiction of the event
which should not be made a joke of ,
which is really what this movie did .
if they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie i would .
the acting sucked and it looks like
it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s .
save your time and money by not watching this movie .
