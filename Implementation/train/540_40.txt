first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel 
revelation 
matthew 24 
isaiah and other prophetic scripture .
there is also nothing wrong
with making a film such as this
to attempt to present the gospel message .
so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspiration .
as a christian 
though an amillenialist 
i believe
there will be a great tribulation and i believe
christ will return
as he said as much .
so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture
that is not why i rate this movie so low.no ,
what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message 
but rather its lack of production value 
awful script 
mediocre acting 
and pitiful fx .
this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s .
no 
this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace .
this movie failed to age well
and was probably dated by the time
they made a sequel.the apocalypse genre film producer
could have learned
how not to make an end time film from this ,
but they failed .
the left behind series 
the apocalypse series 
and the omega code series all failed to learn from this
because they addressed the fx problem and the dated look problem ,
but their script are still poor ,
and their acting is wooden.there are great christian film 
with extremely low budget ,
but this film is not one of them .
i am surprised
the mst3k crew never lampooned this one .
