christopher lloyd is funny
and really believable as `` al the head angel '' .
this movie is much better than the first ,
but it has great special effect
that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing.ok -
it was written for kid ,
but adult have as much fun as the kid do .
tony danza does a very realistic job in his role -
but this is not a taxi reunion.danny glover is actually good
and even seems to be very human in his emotion as well
as showing some real acting talent for a change ,
a pleasant change.watch at least once - it is worth the effort
to catch it .
