i saw this on a can notonese vcd with the english subtitle .
i thought
the story was good
but there were time
when some of the subcharacter were grossly over-acting .
this took away from the film
as did the fairly lame musical score ,
which really irked me throughout the entire movie .
if the musical score was improved
i could overlook the few overacted scene .
then the film would be much 
much better .
