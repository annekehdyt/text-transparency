high school friend andre kriegman and cal gaiel declare war on their classmate
and plan a terrifying assault on their high school .
as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge ,
the two start a video diary
to explain their feeling
and chronicle their mission.there is another similar movie like this ,
called `` elephant . ''
why do i ing this up ?
to compare the two film 
of course .
i have to say ,
even though i liked `` elephant 
'' this is a much better film .
what is the difference ,
you ask ?
well 
for starter 
this is shot differently 
much along the line of `` cloverfield 
'' `` blair witch project 
'' and `` diary of the dead . ''
this makes the movie all the better
because it is much more painfully realistic.but
what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the `` other side of the story . ''
you get to know these two shooter 
unlike `` elephant . ''
i actually cared for one of the shooter
and could understand their action
and why they did
what they did .
this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these person
and that is a good thing
because it is not always black and white.to be honest ,
this is why i almost cried in this movie .
the character are real human
being with logic
and reason behind their action .
you get to understand them .
it is not like they want to kill person for attention .
overall 
this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than `` elephant . ''
