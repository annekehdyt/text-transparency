from the start of this movie you soon become aware
that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman
being chased by person in very silly mask to servant running round in the worst clothing i
have ever seen and all this in subtitle makes this the kind of movie
you should think
twice about seeing
and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise
that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder
where the title came from some part of the film
made a bit of sense with pierre
and is father
but as the film gets to its really silly ending
you have got to think
why end a film this way
and surly they had a better ending
if only in there head this is not a film to watch basically
