monarch cove was one of the best friday night 's drama
shown in a long time.i am
asking the writer to please write a long series
and air it on lifetime ,
soon.each person was very interesting
and did a wonderful job with their line
to make the plot come true .
however 
the movie needs to continue for a long time .
i would love to see bianca and jake 's child grow-up
and get a major role in the movie 
along with the new grandparent planning for her educational future .
also 
ing kathy back to see her niece
and help foster her life.it was great seeing the grandparent work out their problem ,
but the family business needed to be restored to working status ,
and let us see
how jake and bianca survive through the marriage year .
