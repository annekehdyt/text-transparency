i really like this movie .
bozz is an ultra-cool ,
not to be intimidated soldier
who does not want to go to war .
his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch-22 
joseph heller 's classic novel about man and war .
this film 
however 
is not set in a war zone ,
but in a pre-war combat prep training .
this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization
that the vietnam war was a mistake and those man
who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause.colin farrell
is illiant as bozz 
a soldier
who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier
as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishmant
that was trying to kill him .
bozz is totally cool and non-plussed 
testing and tweaking his military superior ,
getting their goat at every opportunity .
he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree 
`` saving '' his fellow soldier
and showing the one in genuine need ,
the way out of this man 's army.the acting and action is crisp and believable
and as a `` sleeper '' 
tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam film in my opinion.five star 
a top pick .
