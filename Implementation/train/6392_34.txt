spoiler within.it appears
that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the event
than she was in her earlier film versprechen 
das
( 1995 )
.the direction seemed carefully controlled ,
and visually i felt
it was highly appealing -
especially where the visual narrative was concerned
( the title-sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern time commemorating the death of various character in the past )
.to clarify two point
that many person have been confused by :
firstly ,
lena did not sleep with goebbel .
although this may have seemed implied ,
it was not the intent .
von trotta told me so herself !
( and she is a very nice lady 
by the way !
) secondly 
the time-frame of event was in fact historically accurate
( the actual date are shown on the close-up of the memorial )
and the prisoner were released as suddenly as in the film .
there is evidence showing
that goebbel was annoyed about having done this ,
and had planned
to eventually recapture those
he had set free.overall ,
what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over-movied ' era .
it seems a shame
that it has taken such a long time
( for various reason )
for this film to hit our screens.more of the same please
