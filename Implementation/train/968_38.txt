since september of last year 
i have been borrowing four to six film each week from the harold washington liary ,
which boasts an impressive dvd collection .
( the hwl truly is a circulating liary :
three-quarter of its film are out at any given time ! )
recently 
i was thrilled to find the short film of david lynch .
yesterday ,
knowing little about the animated series ,
i picked up dumbland .
i am here to report
that 
for david lynch fan ,
watching the eight episode
is half an hour well-spent.the most remarkable feature of these ief piece
are their soundtrack .
each episode has its own rhythm .
respiratory and digestive system provide percussion .
outrageous voice accent pause ' end .
physical violence supplies the beat .
chirping bird and buzzing socket ush along the edge .
many other element fill out the orchestra .
the pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound ,
but the soundtrack itself struck me as lynch 's primary interest
in creating and disseminating this work .
in a way 
these eight short are unique lynchian rhythms.that said ,
the situation are odd 
ugly 
profound 
dumb and funny as hell .
and there is enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we human can be .
i can not say
that i will watch the collection again 
but for anyone
who revelled in the movement
that is the suite inland empire ,
dumbland is worth half an hour of your time .
