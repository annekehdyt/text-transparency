i strongly disagree with `` ctomvelu ''
regarding jim belushi 's talent .
i happen to like belushi very much .
admittedly 
i was skeptical
when he first appeared on the scene ,
because i was such a huge fan of his late other john .
but jim has an on-screen charm
that has gotten him very far
-- and he has developed it well over the years.curly sue is one of his earlier film --
his weight is a giveaway (
are not that true for most of us ? )
-- and i like the film .
yes 
it is touching and heartwarming ,
so
if you are into car chase 
explosion and gratuitous sex ,
then you might want to pass on this one
-- it is a warm film of three lost sole
who find each other .
do not get me wrong ,
i am all for the three aforementioned key to a successful film ,
but i also like a nice 
solid tale like this one.and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performance ,
the real star of this film is alisan porter
-- who is absolutely adorable.i do not know what happened to her career ,
but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball
( agent ?
parent ?
herself ? )
should be shot .
you could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film ,
and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since.another sad hollywood story ...
