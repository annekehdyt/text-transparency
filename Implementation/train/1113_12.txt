not wishing to give *anything* away here ,
i would just say this technically excellent 
flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment :
it will amuse 
surprise 
possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstring from time to time ,
as it approaches the inevitable 
but not obvious ,
ending
without becoming clich\u00e9d or predictable in any way .
most definitely recommended.a previous user 's comment gives 8/10 for the film and 10/10 for both branagh and bonham-carter 's outstanding performance -
i agree entirely ... .
