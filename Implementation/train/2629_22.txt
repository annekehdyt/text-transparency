# 3 in young john travolta 's trilogy of blockbuster .
he dances to disco 
rock 'n ' roll and country .
he heads to houston to find work and love .
gilley 's is the hot spot ,
and it is the time of the mechanical bull .
not to be outdone ,
i rode the bull at a club in nashville .
i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television
and remembered how good it was
and how good a year 1980 was .
i wore a black cowboy hat
that year just like travolta .
dea winger was in her prime .
she looks stunning in her red top .
there is plenty of charisma .
bud and sissy seem the ideal couple
even if they are trailer trash .
they split up just
because it feels so good getting back together .
urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack .
we get to hear lyin ' eye by the eagle and lookin ' for love by johnny lee .
