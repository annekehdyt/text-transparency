i had the opportunity
to see this film debut at the appalachian film festival ,
in which it won an award for best picture .
this film is illiantly done 
with an excellent cast
that works well as an ensemble .
my favorite performance were from youssef kerkour 
justin lane 
and adam jone .
also 
there are some great effect with dragonfly and cockroach ,
that i was surprised to find out
that this film was done on a small budget .
the writer-director adam jone ,
who i believe
also won an award for his writing ,
does an excellent job with direction .
the audience loved this movie .
cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie .
definitely a must see .
