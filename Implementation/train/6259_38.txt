after a few lean year 
1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis :
not only did he make that celeated `` comeback '' tv special
but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movie as well \u0096 speedway and live a little 
love a little .
therefore 
personally i can forgive him for the misstep
that was stay away 
joe
which 
at best 
emerges as an interesting misfire
and is not all that bad considering .
sure 
burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing \u0096 as 
respectively 
a dopey indian father to elvis ' character and a bawdy bartender
who has her eye on mr. presley too -
but one is glad to see elvis
surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado
( as meredith 's mexican wife ) ,
the two jone \u0096 henry and l.q .
- and thomas gomez
who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud
who is meredith 's stubborn father
still donning his old chieftain clothe in the present day !
while there is a surprising
( if not unwelcome given their usual blandness )
lack of song ,
there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all party were the male indians hit the bottle steadily
while presley practice his womanizing skill behind their back !
as can be expected ,
the typically 'western ' arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy ,
snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point .
on the other hand 
the climactic 'destruction of the house ' episode is one
we have seen too often since
and does not work too well here ...
