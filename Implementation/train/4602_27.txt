this movie is one among the very few indian movie ,
that would never fade away with the passage of time ,
nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish ,
even as the indian cinema transform into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture
while drill oriented extra take
to enhancing the p.t .
styled film song.the cinematography speak of the excellent skill of josef werching
that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety.gone are the day of great cinema ,
when every scene had to be clipped many time and retake taken
before finalizing it ,
while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scene .
some of its poignant scene are filled with sublime emotional intensity 
like the instance ,
when meena kumari refuses to say `` yes '' as an approval for nikah
( marriage bond )
and climbs down the hill
while running berserk in traumatized frenzy .
at the moment 
raj kumar follows her ,
and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari
and onto the leg of kumar ... ... ..kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden word in the annal of indian cinema 's history for endeavoring
to complete this movie in a record
setting 12 year .
he had to manage filming of some of the vital song
without meena 's close up ,
because meena kumari 
the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971 .
