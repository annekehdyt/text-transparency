a well-made and imaginative production 
refreshingly free from clich\u00e9 
this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship
that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal condition :
the man an escaped convict
who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage .
expertly
directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement ,
the film provides freshness in nearly every scene ,
as felon martin steckert
( richard harris ) ,
believing
that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved ,
contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan ,
following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore
as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood .
often bursting into song or dancing a few step ,
the capricious steckert gradually gain the trust and affection of his captive and 
as polouse close in for an inevitable showdown ,
the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their response to form of rejection 
as discerned by a psychiatrist
( lindsay wagner )
assigned to aid a zealous polouse lieutenant
( jame coburn )
who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his `` prisoner '' .
this is an engrossing story ,
worth telling 
a quickly-paced and novel adventure
that profit from a capital performance by harris ,
fine turn from wagner 
coburn 
and karen black 
along with justin henry as the snatched lad 
with an appropriately whimsical score
contributed by wilfred josephs ,
and top-notch cinematography by frank watt ,
with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province .
