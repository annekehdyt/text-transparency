i had two reason for watching this swashbuckler
when it aired on danish television yesterday .
first of all 
i wanted to see gina lolloigida -
and here i was not disappointed .
she looked gorgeous .
second of all 
through reading about the film i had gotten the impression
that it featured absurd humor
not unlike
that which can be found in philippe de broca 's film .
on this account 
however 
i was sadly disappointed .
i found the joke predictable
( apart from a few witty remark on the topic of war )
and the character completely one-dimensional .
also 
the action scene were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion 
with no sense of drama at all .
i kept watching until the end ,
but i got bored very quickly
and just sat there ,
waiting for the scene with lolloigida .
