perhaps i am out of date
or just do not know
what electra is like in current publication ...
but the electra
that i read was far more manipulative
and always seems to have a plan .
she usually used other
to do her dirty work
and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved .
just when you think
you have it all figured out
she pull the wool over your eye
and gets her way.this movie was fairly weak on the dialog ,
the acting was not particularly convincing ,
and the action was spotty .
i was really looking for something more along the line of frank miller 's book `` electra assassin . ''
which is much darker than anything in this movie.special effect
where cool ,
action was interesting at time ,
but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical .
tha hand was not menacing enough ,
and electra was not ... .. bitchy enough .
she is the girl you love to hate ... but in this story ,
i just did not care either way .
