i stopped five minute
in when beowulf was given a double-shot ,
automatic crossbow with sight on it .
not only do crossbow not have telescoping sight ,
but beowulf beat grendel in hand-to-hand combat .
the terrible 
wooden acting and eternal darkness
that plagues all sci-fi original movie did not help either .
having only gotten a few minute in before i felt my bile rise
and decided to watch i love lucy rerun instead ,
that is really about all i have to say .
but 
you might as well just realize
that it is a made-for-tv movie
and skip it right there.a travesty .
