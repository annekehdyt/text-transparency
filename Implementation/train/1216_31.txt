we all create our own reality ,
or do we ?
that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality .
blending eastern and buddhist philosophy with the visual chicanery of m.c .
escher 
this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cereal question of `who are we
and what is our place in the universe ?
' ,
and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minute .
the film center on bart 
a writer struggling with his screenplay 
`the sea
that thinks . '
as he sits at his computer ,
the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer ,
writing the screenplay .
before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum
in which everything he writes becomes reality .
director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual trick
that confront the nature and validity of our perception .
ultimately 
de graaff 's film challenges the audience at several level to question
whether anything we see or touch or taste
is really what it appears to be ,
or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our sense .
