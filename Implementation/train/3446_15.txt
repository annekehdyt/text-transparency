all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film ,
set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente
( run lola run ) ,
franka play kate 
a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friend
who falls asleep at an underground station ,
only to wake up and find
she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by `` someone '' or `` something '' with killer intentions.plot hole and unbelievability are rife
and there are very few moment
that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.all in all an unpleasant film
that should just stay locked underground forever
and do us all a favour.the
only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell ,
who 's done better than this \u0096
that is even including `` erasmus microman '' ! .
