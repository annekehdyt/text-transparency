updated version of a story
that had been turned into the film in 1938 england
( return of the frog )
concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal
known as the frog
because of the frog like get up
( bulging eye etc )
he wears.one of the good wallace film from the 1960 's it is a solid little entertainment .
clearly influenced by
( or did this influence )
the restart of the dr mabuse film 
the frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief .
while not the best of the wallace film ,
it is worth a look .
it would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film.between 6 and 7/10 .
