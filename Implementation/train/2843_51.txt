i guess
when `` beat street '' made a national appearance ,
`` flashdance '' came at the same time .
the problem with `` flashdance '' is that there was only one eak dancing scene
and the rest was jazz dance and ballet .
that was one of the reason
why `` beat street '' was better .
the only movie
that could rival `` beat street ''
seems to be `` footloose '' ,
because both movie focused on how dance had been used by person
to express their utmost feelings.the eak-dance scene in `` beat street '' come just before the middle and at the end of the flick .
and i loved all of them .
almost all of the eak trick were featured in the eak jam scene :
the jackhammer 
the flare 
the head spins 
the suicide sit 
the crazy legs 
the mortal 
the forward flip 
the figure four
-- -almost everything.like `` the warrior '' ,
`` beat street '' does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world ...
but in a much less violent way than the former .
the only major fight scene in `` beat street ''
was
when graffiti artist ramon
( which in the movie was abeviated as `` ramo '' )
is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway track ...
..fighting each other on the third rail
and both dying by electrocution on that rail .
well ,
although that chase scene
ended tragically ,
it was better
that they died that way
than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture 
and rap music .
a lot of rap music appeared in the flick ,
because hip-hop member used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspect of gang life .
even the theme song of the movie ,
which closed the curtain to the flick ,
was not just an homage to hip-hop culture
-- it also was an homage to the death of ramon.by the way 
during the dance scene
called 'tango 
tango ' ,
i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra
conducted by actress rae dawn chong
was sheila e. making a cameo appearance .
