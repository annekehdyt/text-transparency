there is nothing i hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness .
kevin smith deserve to be hung up by his toenail for inspiring every white middle-class whiner
to make a movie
about why
they can not get laid .
i do not really mind inexperience and low-budget production
but when the writing is this obvious and cloying
it really burns my potato .
the money put into this could have gone to a real struggling filmmaker
who actually has a chance like john gulager .
if you watch project greenlight you will immediately recognize a talented visionary
who is fighting against the system .
anybody could grab a camera
and make a talkative picture
that does not manage to say anything really 
at all .
when will we be saved from the smithonite and whedonette of the world ?
the revolution can not come soon enough .
go watch a real first time effort
by buying desperado or searching out friend with benefit .
thank you and good day .
