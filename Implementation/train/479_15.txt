i have grown up with scooby doo all my life ,
my dad grew up with scooby doo .
we have just watched the first episode of the travesty
that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue .
what planet are warner bro on allowing this shambles to air .
the character could have been drawn better by my younger sister .
the story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousin
( who are scooby doo fan too ) .
scooby and shaggy just are not ! ! ! ! !
if anyone but casey kasem does the voice of shaggy
it just is not gon na work folk ! ! ! !
trust me.this program was disgraceful .
what is new scooby doo is much better .
why change a winning format .
bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby
