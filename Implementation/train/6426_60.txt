this is one of the very worst film clark gable made .
only parnell was obviously worse .
it is just so painfully clich\u00e9d
and the dialog is so lousy
that it is something
neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making.gable is a heel whose illegal activity result in his girl going ' to the slammer
( like the gangster talk ? ) .
she holds out hope
that he will do the right thing
but he just leaves her there
-- unknown to either of them 
gosh ,
that she is `` in the family way '' .
eventually 
the rogue return
to do the right thing and somehow
they tie this all together into a happy ending !
they seemed to have forgotten about gable 's needing
to take the rap
and spend several year in the hoosegow .
leonard maltin says
`` the star are at their best here '' .
by what standard ?
best at producing unintended chuckle ?
gim me a eak ! ps
-- after saying this ,
my wife thinks
leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt .
hmmm .
however ,
despite my comment ,
i think
mr. maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet
( i hope
that appeased him ) .update
-- 2/2/08 .
because i disliked this film so much the first time
( especially the ridiculous ending ) ,
i decided to watch it once again .
after all 
sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more
and realize
that i was a bit too harsh .
while that has been the case with several film in recent month ,
i still disliked this film
-- even the second time .
most of it was not because of the first half of the film .
in the first half 
harlow 's character was amazingly stupid
but at least it was believable .
but when she was sent to prison ,
it was all clich\u00e9s until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred .
the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb
-- it just makes no sense at all
and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two con .
i stand by my original review
( despite all the `` not helpfuls '' )
and think
that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus 
it might just be the worst gable film .
