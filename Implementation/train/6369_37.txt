some may feel
that the rating i have just given is a bit generous ,
but for what this film is i think
the director have done a good job
with that they had available to them ,
this is also a film a film of an acquired taste !
my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing ' i.e the parasitical alien from outta space 
infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible !
you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and other of the horror/gore genre ,
however cleverly maintains its own originality ,
well these thing fight each other for one
and then continue to eat then fallen rival !
only killing and picking a human
when it needs a new host !
to then pick another fight with another infected host !
and this film even throws in a love story
but i wont say
no more otherwise it gives too much away.great !
but like i said of an acquired taste ,
so do not be surprised
if you do not like the film .
it is low budget
and yes
it is blood thirsty 
with the creatures/alien/thing morphing their limb into crude looking weapon ,
i.e saw 
drill 
blade and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent .
i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next !
so if you like gore ,
you like alien ,
you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love
thrown in somewhere ,
then i must recommend this film
as a must see .
i just wish i came across this earlier
then i did !
