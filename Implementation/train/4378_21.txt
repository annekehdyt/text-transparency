the movie has a distinct
( albeit utish and rough )
humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy/lyrical score point up the comic side of their misadventure ,
and
even when they are at their most thuggish
( like terrorizing the woman on the train ) ,
a semi-pitiful vulnerability lurk never far away
( dewaere suck on her east like a baby ) .
blier cut away from the scene
where depardieu may be about to rape dewaere ,
so we are never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way ,
that incident is the start of their relative humanization
( so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay ,
although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want ) .
the movie has many objectionable scene and point of sexual politic
and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foible of both sex ,
making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty ,
and hitting numerous point of possible profundity on the basis
that
if you fire off enough shot ,
some of them are bound to hit .
