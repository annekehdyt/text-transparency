i really love this movie .
i remember one time
when i was in 2nd > grade ,
my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel .
this movie 
however 
can be a little frightening for 2nd grader such as the scene
where bill murder nancy
and seeing fagin 's face for the first time on the screen .
one of my relative is sick of seeing this movie
because she studied over it in music class .
if i were a teacher
and could grade the person
who produced this wonderful film ,
i would give them an a+ .
