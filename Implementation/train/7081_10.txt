i really hope
that concorde/new horizon was not trying to make a serious horror 
or even action movie
when they made carnosaur 3. the movie is flat-out silly from start to finish .
even the humor in c3 is funny
because it is bad .
definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad
it is good ' genre .
if you enjoy the very worst of the worst ,
this is for you .
