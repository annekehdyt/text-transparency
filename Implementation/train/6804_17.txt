a great british indy movie !
fantastic chemistry between the 3 main character make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set piece
that cheech and chong would be proud of .
great to see phil daniel back on the big screen
( even if he has swapped side since quadrophenia ! )
and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the lady !
loved the final fight scene with it is nod to zulu
and now i know
what happened to arthur brown
after he set himself on fire on top of the pops ! ...
he is not acting ...
.he really is a bona-fide british hippie ! ! !
you do not have to be a biker
to enjoy this
and it is straight into my friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection .
give this film a go
and you will not be disappointed .
