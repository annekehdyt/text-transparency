unentertaining 
uninvolving hyid of `` cruel intention '' and `` wild thing '' ,
but it is not nearly as good as either of those trash min-classic .
it is about the acting sheriff 
artie
( taye diggs )
being called in
to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class univesity ,
but to keep it on the down low .
as he digs deeper
he thinks
it is much more
than it at first glance seems to be .
we follow alicia 
the girl
who overdosed in flashback as well .
at about 90 minute 
if this film was welcomed to begin with ,
it would have worn it out .
this film ings absolutely nothing new to the table .
but it is the only movie
thus far
that has miss swain topless
so the grade is higher just for that.my grade :
deye candy :
dominique swain gets topless
( fixing a mistake of `` happy camper '' ) ;
another girl is topless anti-eye candy :
more man ass than girl tit
