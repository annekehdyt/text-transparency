clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film 
essentially a film about a spanish/american girl
who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war .
it turns out ,
the mother goes home to die ,
and she is left with her grandfather .
she also makes friend and experience much in a short time .
tomiche
( juan jose ballestra )
is at first a nuisance to her then
they become close .
the film is shot beautifully 
bathed in soft color mostly .
carol yearn for her dad ,
who is a pilot in the war ,
and you can feel
the love sher has for him .
while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film ,
it envelops the character 's life .
i think
you will like it .
see it especially for clara lago ,
who does a great job as carol .
she is definitely one to watch .
