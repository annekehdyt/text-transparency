this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtiz 's film `` angel with dirty faces '' .
as directed by ray enright ,
the only interesting thing is how tamed these kid were in comparison
with what is going on with the youth in america 's inner city today.the film
is only worth seeing
because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan ,
who showed
they were well paired together .
the dead end kid have larger part
as the plot concentrate on them rather than in the older folks.in a way
it is curious how arson was used in the same way
some scrupulous landlord did in later year right here in new york .
it was the quickest way
to turn a property around
never considering the social problem
it created .
in today 's climate with so many gun around there is a new reality .
the young kid of the story seemed mere prankster rather than criminal .
how time change !
