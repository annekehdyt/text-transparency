i love horror movie
that ings out a real amount of mystery like say
`` silent hill ''
( which i found to be quite good 
but still ,
was missing something )
and movie
that keeps you guessing ,
this i thought was one of those movie .
at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense
and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene ,
but after that it just rolls down the hill
and from there it only goes faster and faster down .
i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason
because i can see a lot of `` stolen '' theme from that movie in here.. all in all i would say ,
watch silent hill instead of this one 
its better 
its more scary ,
it has a lot more suspense
and also the ending is a lot better.. and best of all ,
you wont feel ripped off
as i did with this one.. this just seems to be one of those `` i like that movie so i am gon na re-make it in my own really bad version '' kinda movie.. oh and one more thing ... lordi.. in a horror movie ...
that like trying to scare a kid with a care bear
who has `` hug me and i will love you forever ''
written on the stomach of it..
