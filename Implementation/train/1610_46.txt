the `` math '' aspect to this is merely a gimmick
to try to set this tv show
apart from the million of other cop show .
the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow ,
although his career must have been ( undeservedly )
waning after northern exposure
if he signed up for this schlock.the lame-ness of the `` math '' aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring lou diamond phillip
( which just confirms
that this show is the last refuge of the damned . )
in order to catch a fugitive ,
the `` mathematician '' uses some theory about `` bubble '' .
so 
he gives this long explanation that ,
if we have seen the suspect in place a 
b and c ,
then we can use `` bubble theory '' to calculate
where he might be .
he does this all on a chalkboard 
or maybe with a stick in the dirt
( i can not remember )
.anyway ,
when you look at the finished product ,
he basically took three spot ,
and picked a point right in the middle
and said
`` ok 
mathematically 
here is where we are most likely to find the fugitive . ''
at which point 
one other character point out `` oh ,
that point also happens to be the cabin
where the guy used to live . ''
is that math ?
its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots ! ! !
this show reminds me of the math major i used
to work with in banking
who had a mathematical analysis
he could do to `` support '' point
that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense.it
just goes to show
-- when you are a hammer ,
everything look like a nail .
i can not wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama ...
they will use calculus 
call an airstrike in the middle of the mountain ,
and hit osama and not even scratch the five child he uses as human shield ... cuz hey ... its all about the numbers.totally ludicrous tv show .
