this has got to be one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
it is ( i think )
a story of a rebellious college basketball player 
his tough-but-fair coach 
his girlfriend 
and a fellow student
( played by michael margotta )
who has continual nervous eakdown .
the story goes nowhere ,
there is zero character development ,
there is nobody to care about ,
and the performance 
with the exception of bruce dern as the coach 
are terrible .
it is hard to believe
how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie .
make sure to avoid this turkey .
