imagine
that you are asked by your date
what movie you wanted to see ,
and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about `` the grudge . ''
so 
in good faith 
you recommend seeing that movie .
it is the halloween season 
after all .
and it did boffo box office this past weekend ,
so it must be pretty good ...
so you go.and you are actually in a state of shock
when the movie ends the way
it does ,
and you hear yourself audibly saying ,
`` that can not be the end of the movie ... . ''
but 
alas 
it is .
and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed
for recommending such a dog of a movie .
you think
that your date think
you are a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity ,
and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship .
actually 
it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was .
i see no future for miss gellar in the movie ,
and suggest
that she sticks to television in the future .
actually 
it will not be long
before she is consigned to flea-market convention selling buffy memorabilium ,
and it can not happen soon enough ,
if you ask me .
horrible 
horrible 
horrible .
the plot did not make sense ;
continuity was terrible .
it is apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a `` grudge ii
-- the return of 'cat-boy ' . ''
