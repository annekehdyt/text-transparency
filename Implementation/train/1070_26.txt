here again is yet another diane lane movie
where she cheats on her husband .
is this the only role
she knows how to play ?
this time it is set in 1969
and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man .
i am so not surprised
because that is so very predictable .
then her husband gets mad
and throws the milk .
i would not be surprised
if she slept with the milkman as well .
i would not be surprised
if she slept with the ice cream man too
because this is a very boring movie .
then after some milk throwing 
she says
sorry and sees the blouse man again .
duh .
then
while she is making it with him 
her son gets stung by wasps .
my mom always told me not to throw rock at a wasps nest .
this kid mom did not have time
to tell him that ,
she was too busy with the blouse man .
