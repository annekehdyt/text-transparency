this movie deliver .
the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor try to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks
like he is never been anywhere near a bike in his life
as he attempts not to fall off.but this movie
does not stop there ,
when less than 5 minute later it deliver a scene of nothing but an arm
reaching through a fence and into a cooler
pulling out a beer .
stereotypical grilling dad 
several plot line
that go nowhere ,
and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up
to making this the perfect saturday night at home .
