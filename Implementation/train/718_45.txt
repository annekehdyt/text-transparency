this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan
which was aired at least 15 year ago .
the series was known as `` gubbarre '' meaning balloon .
each episode was a new short story .
the story is excellent
and the original is much sweeter
and `` convincing '' abhay doel does a good job
but he does not fit the role of a `` normal '' and `` third class '' guy
( as he calls himself in the movie ) .
in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short
and without the designer clothe would have fitted the abhays role
but shayan just does not have the talent
to pull
it off.i would suggest watching the series
if it is available .
it is the same story except for the running around with the friend mother and the initial introduction .
the acting of the tv actor was much better
than these `` star '' .the only reason
this movie is a flop
is because the director tried to stretch half an hour
( or 45 minute )
story to 2+ hour .
so it has to get draggy .
even the nasal singing sensation song could not make up.this movie is good for a lazy sunday afternoon
and is really refreshing
if you have not watched the original tv serial .
the script and the ending of the serial was much better # # # # # spoiler ahead # # # # # # # # # # # # # # spoiler ahead # # # # # # # # # # # # # # spoiler ahead # # # # # # # # # # # # # # spoiler ahead # # # # # # # # # # # # # # spoiler ahead # # # # # # # # #
the ending of the original serial was much stronger
as the hero himself dumps the girl
even thought she is willing to marry him .
he is aware and tell her
that he does not want to be `` repayed ''
and never helped with that intention .
the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film .
the original ending would have bought tear to the girl eye
and would have had the guy nodding in agreement .
the deliver just was not right.but personally i feel
this is a pathetic copy .
no credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter .
the story is amazing
and is by one of the famous novel writer int
he class of premchand munshi .
i am not sure
if this is premchand munshi 's story but many of the other short story int
he series feature a few of premchand munshi 's and other great hindi writer story .
