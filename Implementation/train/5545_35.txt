well 
tivo recorded this because of angelina jolie .
it had 2.5 star .
it seemed promising .
it went downhill fast.there is much overacting 
even from angelina .
she is about 20
and playing a 16 year old .
there are three character
that are supposed to be italian .
everyone else is italian- american .
the native italian accent were good ,
i thought .
the young male lead is cute ,
my wife says .
everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman .
even the men.i should have known
that
when dick van patten was cast as a randy doctor ,
that that was a bad sign .
the two couple
chasing their kid around
are like the four italian stooges.my wife would not let go of the remote .
hopefully she was not taking makeup 
clothing or decorating tip .
it was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish .
it was hidegarishous.cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain
of watching this movie .
if this movie shows up on your tv ,
do yourself a favor and ram your head through the tv screen instead .
you will be glad you did .
the only movie i have ever seen
that was worse than this was `` hamburger :
the movie '' .
or maybe `` deadly friend '' .
