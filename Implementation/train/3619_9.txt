this movie surprised me ,
it had good one-liner and laugh 
+ a nonstop action-packed storyline with ton of gun action and explosion .
this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twist and turn .
the plot is solid
despite what other may think ,
it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end .
in conclusion ; this is a great way for an action movie buff
to spend time on .
