this kind of film has become old hat by now ,
has not it ?
the whole thing is syrupy nostalgium
turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop.it sure sounds like a good idea :
a great ensemble cast 
some good gag 
and some human drama about what could have/might have been .
unfortunately 
there is no central event
that binds them all together ,
like there was in `` the big chill '' 
one of those seminal movie
that spawned copycat film like this one .
you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular person
instead of getting short takes on everyone .
the superficiality this creates is not just annoying ,
it is maddening .
the below-average script does not help .
