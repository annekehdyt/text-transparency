first off 
this is an excellent series ,
though we have sort of a jame bond effect .
what i mean is that
while the new casino royale takes place in 2006 ,
it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 
dr. no
( 1962 )
being the second ,
while in golden eye 
the first film with pierce brosnan 
judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male `` m ''
so how could
she have been in place in the beginning
before bond became a double-0 ,
aside from the fact
that she is obviously 14 year older ?
this is more or less a `` poetic '' license to thrill .
we need to turn our head aside a bit
if we wish to be entertained .
no 
the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronic of the original series from nearly half a century ago .
in the 1960 's communicator were fantasy .
( now we call them cell phone )
and there were sliding lever instead of button .
omg ,
do you think
400 year from now ,
they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard ?
so 
please 
let 's give the producer some leeway.but
to try
and make thing a bit consistent ,
let us just ponder about the cylon creation
just 60 year prior to the end of battlestar galactica .
if that is the case ,
where did all the cylon
that populated the original earth come from ?
we know
that the technology exists for spontaneous jump through space .
well 
what happened
if one of the cyclon ship at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon
or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship ,
loaded with human-looking cylon ,
wound up not only jumping through space ,
but through time 
back a thousand or ten thousand year with a crippled ship near earth one .
they colonized it ,
found out they could repopulate it
and eventually destroyed themselves ,
but not before they themselves sent out a `` ragtag '' fleet to search for the legendary caprica ,
only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet ,
which they colonized to become the human ,
who eventually invented the cylon .
time paradox ?
of course .
which came first 
the chicken or the road ?
who cares ?
it is fraking entertaining !
