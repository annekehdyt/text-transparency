i agree with most of the columbo fan
that this movie was an unnecessary change of format .
columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox polouse method .
this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past .
and that is the disturbing point ,
because columbo is no ordinary detective.there are two part in this film
that left me intriguing .
first 
i can not figure out the title of this movie .
it is misleading .
maybe a better title would 've been `` the vanishing bride '' or something similar .
second 
columbo hides a piece of evidence
without offering the reason
( to the viewer at least )
why
he does it.i do not feel betrayed ,
just disappointed .
i am
glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo .
