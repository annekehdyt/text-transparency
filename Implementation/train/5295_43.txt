`` victor does not have much ,
but that is not stopping him from trying to go out with judy 
the prettiest girl on the block .
all he is got is hope and a one-bedroom apartment
he share with his family .
his grandmother does not trust him 
his other worship him ,
and his half-sister just declared war .
but victor think
love really can conquer all in this warm 
genuine 
and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city most person never see 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.peter sollett ' `` raising victor vargas '' elicits engaging `` debut '' performance from lead actor victor rasuk
( as victor vargas )
and the cast .
mr. rasuk and juicy judy marte
( as judy gonzalez )
are sexy
and endearing as `` lower east side kid '' discovering the joy of sexual attraction .
considering how attractive they look in this picture ,
it is not hard to predict they hook up - and ,
although you may wonder how `` innocent '' they really are ,
their characterization seem true.victor 's other `` nino '' is played by victor 's real-life other silvestre rasuk ,
who looks the part his older other is playing .
sometimes 
it is nice to see movie other
who actually look alike ;
and 
hopefully they will work together again .
`` cuckoo for cocoa puff '' sister krystal rodriguez
( as vicki )
and old world altagracia guzman
( as grandma )
round out the sex-starved dominican immigrant family .
so 
are hand-held-camera coming-of-age film in vogue 
or what ?
