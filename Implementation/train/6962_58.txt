i have watched anime
but i am not a die hard fan ;
and i do not read manga .
i say
this
because many of the reviewer
who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background .
i have seen `` st. john 's wort 
''
and although it is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination ,
it made me pick up `` shinobi 
''
especially since everyone seems to love it.well ,
i watched it this afternoon ,
and fought very hard
to keep watching .
yes 
it is very beautiful - the slow motion water scene ,
the autumn leaves on the tree 
even the cgi eye flicker - majestic .
i liked the hawk 
the costume 
even some of the fight scene ,
but overall this was dull as dirt.it seemed
as if someone took `` romeo and juliet '' - the translation even mention
that they are star crossed lover -
and threw in some `` x-men '' for good measure .
two of the character split wolverine 's power - the guy
dressed in a bear costume
had his claws
and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself .
then you have the girl
who has a poison kiss -
that is poison ivy
( from batman ) .
why do they give these woman such dumb power ?
poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death .
man 
that is some great power for you .
and the other girl 
can create bug from this yellow dust
that she rubs on her hand .
the other woman 
one of the star crossed lover 
has the power of a hypnotic stare .
wow.i sort of made it to the end of the film 
by fast forwarding it ,
and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected .
some person are comparing this to `` house of flying dagger '' and `` hero . ''
do not make that mistake .
they may share similar ending ,
but that is where the similarity end .
`` shinobi '' is made by an amateur -
the other film
are made by an experienced filmmaker.i
would say
avoid this film
unless you are 12 to 18 year old .
