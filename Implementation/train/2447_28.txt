susan swift is an appealing youngster 
a flower child
transplanted to the 1980 's
( like a young susan dey ) ,
but she does not quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead
and she tends to whine ;
still 
she is rather sweet
and has ight eye and a pretty smile .
in `` the coming ''
( as it was called
when iefly released to theater ) ,
swift may be the reincarnation of a salem witch .
the flick is very low-budget and borrow from so many other picture
that i gave up on it with about 15 minute
to go .
it starts out strong
and has some camp appeal .
obviously 
there are more serious film
that deal with the salem witch trial
that deserve to be seen over this one ;
however ,
as junk movie go ,
it is not too terrible .
the boston locale are a definite plus ,
and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy .
