if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product
that we get forced on us these day
do not bother .
this well-written film kept me up
thinking about all
it had to say .
importance of myth in our life
to make it make sense ,
how child interpret the world
( and the violence in it ) ,
our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here ,
but not flatly on the surface .
you could technically call it a `` monster movie ''
even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end ,
and then it is even up
to you
and your belief as to what is happening with the legendary spirit/beast .
some standard thriller element for those
looking just for the basic and the film
never bores ,
though in fact the less you see of the creature 
the better .
fessenden successfully continues george romero 's tradition
of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum
while still keeping us creeped out .
