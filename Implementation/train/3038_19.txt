i just watched this movie on showtime .
quite by accident actually .
if i would not have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two day then i would not have came home early from work .
if i had not came home early from work i
would not have seen this movie .
i would not have known what i was missing ,
but i would 've missed
a lot.that is the way
this movie is .
it is almost playing on the kevin bacon effect .
that and causality
( hence my verbiage above ) .
ever character is intertwined in some way or another .
action 
reaction 
interaction 
non-interaction .
this movie is just wonderful .
i am going to have to find a copy to buy .
