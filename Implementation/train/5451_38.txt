usually 
i do not think
hollywood production are fit
to be called film ,
so i call them 'movies ' instead .
but this piece of elephant manure 
is not even fit to be called a movie ,
hence the quote in the title.where shall i start ?
1.
if this is not the start of geriatric casting ,
it sure is the epitome of it .
stefanie power is supposed to play someone even less than half her age ,
she is supposed to play an 18 year old ,
and she is forty effing two ! ! ! !
2. a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france ,
where we see clich\u00e9 character such as :
the sympathetic grumpy shop owner 
the bitchy queen of model 
the fairy god mother ex-queen of model 
etc .
this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code ,
( which reviewers correctly determined
was a comedy ) .
3. it is highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place
where nudity was so common place ,
especially if the whole focus is about that4 .
the horrible accent ! ! !
5. the nana mouskouri elevator-music ! !
! i could go on ,
but i think
this is enough .
and i was able to make these observation
after watching this crap for just half an hour ,
while surfing the internet and talking to my friend about math equation ... i mean ... ! ! ! !
! i invite everyone to add to my list .
