a few year ago i added a comment to the imdb on `` the real mccoy '' tv series .
i said
then and repeat now it was a charming 
funny ,
and entertaining show 
well-acted with wonderful characterizations.i recently saw on dvd four old episode plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna 
kathy nolan 
and tony martinez .
as another writer here mentioned ,
it is curious that lydia reed
( hassie )
and michael winkelman
( little luke )
were not refered to ,
but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra.the reunion show was well done
and gave us many unknown insight into the show .
one piece of inside information
we did not get
was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute ,
which left luke a `` widow ''
in it is last year ,
which was not very good .
nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy
called `` broadside '' 
about woman nurse in the pacific in ww ii .
get it ?
broadside ?
no 
not funny.unlike the sleazy 
salacious ,
and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our value 
`` the real mccoy '' entertained with decent value and fine human being .
and i thank all involved ,
including the creator 
irving pinkus ,
for having ought it to my family .
we never missed it .
