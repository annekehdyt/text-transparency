macy 
ullman and sutherland were as great as usual .
ritter was not bad either .
what is her name was as pretty as usual .
it could have been a good movie .
to bad the plot was atrocious .
it was completely predictable 
trite and boring.from the first 15 minute ,
the rest of the movie was laid out like a child 's paint by number routine .
the character were stock piece of cut out cardboard .
there was nothing new or interesting
to say
and that completely outweighed the acting ,
which was a pity.finally ,
too bad the script writer was not the victim .
especially with the `` precocious '' line from the child ,
which were completely unbelievable.again ,
it is only the acting
that prevented a much lower score .
