i am at this very moment debating
whether i should even finish watching this `` poppycock '' of a movie .
they had a pretty interesting idea 
with the buried movie set ,
and that was it .
so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story .
there is the buried set ,
some wolf headed monster running amok 
an amulet 
and a bunch of bad actor
attacked by the wolf masked whatever
it is .
what i would have missed ,
had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase 
some really bad c.g.i. 
some incredibly stupid dialog 
more bad c.g.i. ,
and the hero fighting paper cut out .
other than the original idea 
this film has absolutely zero redeeming quality .
my mistake for continuing to watch .
