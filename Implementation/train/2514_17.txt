a bit slow
( somehow like a sofia coppola movie )
but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girl .
the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to ing back many memory
to how it felt like to be their age .
the confusion and the insecurity are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life .
the music is perfect
and the acting is amazing .
the camera works beautifully also .
i highly recommend it for those
who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life
when we discover our sexual impulse and our desire .
i would also say
that it is a fine film for young person
going through that period .
so many movie have been made about adolescence
but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexity .
