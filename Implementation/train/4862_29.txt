this is not among jimmy stewart 's best film
-- i am quick to admit that .
however ,
while some view his film as pure propaganda ,
i am wondering
what is so wrong with that ?
yes 
sure 
like the tv show the fbi 
this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work
to try to drum up support .
but ,
as entertainment goes ,
it does a good job .
plus 
surprisingly enough for the time
it was made 
the film focuses more on crime than espionage and `` commy '' .
instead 
it is a fictionalization of one of the earliest agent and the career
he chose .
now considering
the agent is played by jimmy stewart ,
then it is pretty certain the acting
and writing were good
-- as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio
who was not about to waste the star in a third-rate flick .
so overall 
it is worth seeing but not especially great .
