the acting is some of the worst i
have ever seen ,
the character are totally unconvincing .
this could be overlooked to some extent
if the plot was interesting ,
which the plot to `` the prodigy '' was not .
it is sort of a bad mix between `` fresh '' and `` animal house '' ,
except that both of those movie were good .
