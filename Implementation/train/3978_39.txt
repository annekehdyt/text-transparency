okay ,
so there is a front view of a checker taxi ,
probably late 1930s model .
it has the great triangular shaped headlight .
there also is a desoto cab in this black and white ,
character driven 
almost a musical love gone wrong
story.the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interior and fashion and hotel elevator .
the hair style 
male and female are gorgeous .
if dolly parton had victor mature 's hair
she could have made it big .
there is an artist loft
that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabe.if
you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom-pah-pah ,
you will be disappointed .
there is a nice little story
beneath the runway model approach in this film.my copy on dvd with another movie for $ 1 was very viewable .
the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad 
mad 
mad 
mad world or the pink panther .
this was an rko movie
but it did not have the nice airplane logo
that rko used to use.i liked victor mature in one million 
b.c. 
and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday .
see if you can find that one .
he was wonderful in the comedy with peter seller
called caccia alla volpe
or after the fox.richard carlson went on to do i led three life on tv in the early 1950s.vic mature was offered the part of sampson 's father in the remake of sampson and delilah .
he supposedly was asked
if he would have any problem
playing the part of the father
since he was so well known as sampson .
victor replied ,
`` if the money is right ,
i will play sampson 's mother . ''
