if you are under the age of 6 or 7 ,
then you are going to really enjoy this movie .
my youngest daughter is glued to the tv
when she watches it .
as an adult 
i can not stand it ! !
i am all up for sequel ... .when
they have a decent storyline .
but this is nowhere near up to standard .
please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid 's film ,
but
when you have to sit through it nearly every day
when your kid
who love it so much ,
you will understand why .
my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day
if we let her.i have given this film 4/10 purely for the fact
that it keeps my youngest entertained .
