> contrary to most review i have read ,
i did not feel this followed any of the other rock movie
( `` spinal tap '' 
etc . )
the story was more unique ,
although i feel most person wanted to see the `` sex 
drug and rock and roll '' vice
that the band kept alluding to. > as an american ,
i knew a few of the actor - spall 
connelly and rea .
surprised to find out `` brian '' /bruce robinson was in zifferedi 's
( > `` the flame still burns ''
- my wife ,
who hails from mexico ,
did not follow the english/british language too well ,
missed some of the joke
( which i dutifully explained )
but she cried her eye out at the concert scene .
she loves the song so much now. > funny
that amazon.com has the soundtrack for $ 30+usd
when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for $ 5.50usd .
price non-withstanding 
i first saw this on late night cable
and have been dying to find it ever since .
