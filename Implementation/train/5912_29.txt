just given the fact
that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern time
would have been enough
to give this 2-part 1980 made-for-tv film attention .
but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev .
jim jone ,
who built a church into a virtual empire ,
and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult
in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated ,
and 917 cult follower committed suicide by drinking kool-aid doused with cyanide.done very tastefully
but horrifying enough 
unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned 
guyana tragedy features an all-star cast ,
including ned beatty
( as rep. leo ryan ) ,
meg foster 
randy quaid 
brad dourif 
brenda vaccaro 
levar burton 
and madge sinclair .
but it is power boothe
( in his first big role )
that really stands out as jim jone .
he actually becomes the man ,
and his performance is riveting and chilling .
thus 
it is no wonder
that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty year .
