snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station ,
as you toss this into the waste disposal unit .
spend a useful 90 min .
living your favourite game .
disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk .
it takes a bit from several other `` science fiction '' movie
and badly attempt
to join the part into a pathetically weak story .
there is nothing new here ,
the filmmaker do not seem to realise
that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game ,
but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required
to turn it into a good film .
any money
spent watching this
is a waste ,
and personally i would like my 90 min of life back .
