this movie is not funny .
it just takes the dandd nerd stereotype and amplify them .
all the main character make less than 30k a year ,
they all live with their parent ,
they are all socially retarded ,
and they have no luck with woman .
the joke are horrible and unimaginative ,
such as two of the gamer getting beat up by a black midget
because one of them had a kkk looking hood on
( it was his wizard costume )
and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up
( oh how funny ,
he is a nerd
so he does not know about sport ) .
you may have to be a childish high-schooler
to find any of this stuff funny .
poorly done mockmuntary are so painful to watch ,
but obviously extremely cheap
to make .
i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo .
i guess
these are the only opportunity available for hottie way past their prime .
