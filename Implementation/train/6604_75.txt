riget ii is a good sequel ,
but not quite as good as the first one .
this series do not seem to be quite as serious as the first one .
there are much more comedy in this ,
good one 
though.we are back at the danish rigshospitalet 
the danish national hospital .
mrs. drusse is just about to leave the hospital
as her work is done ,
but fate want 's it otherwise .
she is soon
chasing ghost
and helmer is doing everyone mad
and it is soon to get much worse
as black power are unleashed in the kingdom.this story involves a lot more comedy
that the previous .
by all mean lot of fun ,
but it makes you take the series a little less serious .
the story has kept a lot of element from the last series
and added some new one .
it is well written ,
but some of the new element are just kind of silly ,
but they save it
by making it more like a comedy .
good story 
but not as good 
original and thrilling
as the first series.the actor are the same with some addition to the regular cast .
they are all very good .
it is an odd story and setting .
some part are a total freak show
and the character change during the show so to keep it serious
and keep
it real is not an easy job .
yet 
these actor handle this whole situation perfectly.much of the good quality from the first series are kept intact .
the cinematography is one of those quality .
the hand-held camera
that made trier world
famous gives suspense and reality to the series .
it gives the camera a unique ability
to move
and follow the character
and trier makes use of these ability .
good 
movement 
great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch.be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first .
also be prepared to see some more .
i did not think
that green thing looked all too good .
thought
it was unoriginal
and did not fit .
never the less ,
the effect like the ghost are really good .
the non-digital effect looks good too .
little brother looks just really odd ,
but you accept it .
all over i would say
effect are from ok to good.the music
is also quite good .
moody and nice .
some of it are really touching .
it fits really nice .
as the first one there are rather little music in the action scene
and it works very well.all together this makes a good sequel .
if you would seen
riget you can see this one
without being disappointed .
it has many of the same quality as the first series .
however 
i would recommend seeing the first series
before seeing this .
these two makes up a series
you do not wan na miss .
