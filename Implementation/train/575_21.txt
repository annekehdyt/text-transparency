really bad shot on video `` film ''
made by not one 
not two ,
but three amateur video makers.if you are going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood 
gore and nudity .
there is some blood
provided by latex cut off arm prop
bought at a halloween store .
there are lesbian and hooker but no nudity or sex .
the lesbian spend a lot of time in bed
but only talking.there seems to be no editing effects- fade 
wipe etc .
once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.terrible music by bad heavy metal band
whose website take up the majority of the end credits.the werewolf
are represented by rubber mask
that are attached to just the `` actor '' face .
they did not even bother to apply own makeup to their neck 
arm or wrists.i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie.no reason at all
to buy 
rent or watch this film
except as an example of how not to make a low budget video .
