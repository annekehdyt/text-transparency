i can not believe
that this movie even made it to video ,
and that video rental store are willing to put it on their shelve .
i literary asked for a refund .
take away the fact
that the movie has no historical truth it ,
and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store .
it is not even good enough
to be called a b rated movie .
do not waste your money or your time on this movie .
just listing to the voice over
and the horrible music made me sick .
anyone
involved with this movie
should be pulled from the union ,
gives the industry a black mark ,
but after watching most of this movie i really do not think
anyone involved is a union member .
