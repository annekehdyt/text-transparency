`in the tradition of 'carrie ' and 'heather ' ?
try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two film ,
but 'the evil dead ' and 'the shining ' as well . '
that said ,
they really do not make bad horror movie like this anymore ,
and that is a shame ,
'cause it is a gas.rainbow harvest
is the winona substitute here ,
and although she barely does more than mumble her line
( and occasionally scream 
`you are ugly ! ! ! '
into her haunted mirror ) 
she is goth way
before it is fashionable ,
so you have to respect her .
( and she is quite creative about it too 
accessorizing with black leather scarf and a kind of black-spray-painted hawaiian-punch-guy hat .
eat your heart out 
cher .
)
karen black overacts a bit ,
but she is not totally without dignity ,
and you can not help but sympathize with her .
( unless you are a certain friend of mine ,
who asked ,
`who is that 
horse lip from 'm.a.s.h ' ? '
the first time she came onscreen .
) there are decent supporting performance by kristin dattilo
( as the square chick
who befriends rainbow ) ,
ricky paull goldin
( in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role ) ,
and william `larry 
darryl and darryl ' sanderson
( as some kind of pet undertaker 
or something ) .
but it is sad to see the once smokin ' yvonne decarlo reduced
to playing what can only be thought
of as the charlotte rae part.the eighty were the heyday for hilarious 
mindbogglingly dumb horror movie like this 
and `mirror 
mirror ' was one of the last of its kind .
definitely worth a look .
