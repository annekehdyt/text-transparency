robert altman 's downbeat 
new-fangled western from edmund naughton 's book `` mccabe '' was overlooked at the time of its release
but in the past year has garnered a sterling critical following .
aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario ,
the character here do not merit much interest ,
and the picture looks
( intentionally )
ackish and unappealing .
bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur
who settles in struggling community on the outskirt of nowhere
and helps organize the first othel ;
once the profit start coming in ,
beatty is naturally menaced by city tough
who want part of the action .
altman creates a solemn 
wintry atmosphere for the movie
which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place ,
but the action in this sorry little town is limited
-- most of the story being made up of vignette --
and altman 's pacing is deliberately slow .
there is hardly a statement being made
( just the opposite 
in fact )
and the languid actor stare at each other without much on their mind .
it is a self-defeating picture ,
and yet 
in an altman-quirky way 
it wears defeat proudly .
