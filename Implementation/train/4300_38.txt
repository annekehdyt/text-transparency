one of the most appealing element of a gilliam film is that the well-concocted visual 
the unsettling backdrop 
and the manically frustrated character are evidence of the creator 's involvement .
instead of most movie
( where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire
that is paid to feature a star or two ) ,
you can feel terry gilliam 's presence through the experience .
`` 12 monkey '' is evidence of gilliam 's own vision and style ,
as opposed to making offbeat movie for their own sake .
`` 12 monkey '' is a variation on similar theme of gilliam 's repertoire :
oppressive/recessive society 
the solitude of the protagonist 
the frustration
associated with disbelief ,
and parallel realm .
in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring line between the two realm ,
using ambiguity
to force the audience
to believe rather than know .
this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gap
leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness .
the difference between gilliam and artsy poser is that gilliam 's choice clearly have a purpose and all of his image have meaning .
the two nearly identical bathing scene of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparison
which leave the audience unsettled .
his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world ,
yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world .
the title itself is a mark of gilliam 's creativity ,
as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning
to be fully understood .
all in all 
gilliam 's dedication
to making creative film
that are interesting to watch yet
also require thought and interpretation from the audience .
the film has immense re-watch value ,
since there are subtle detail and hint
that can be missed upon the first viewing .
definitely one of my favorite .
