you like beautiful girl ?
yeah me too .
what is there bad to say about beautiful girl/woman ?
nothing imo ,
so why would i give this movie only 2 star out of 5 ,
although it got the `` talent '' of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto ?
if i really wanted to watch beautiful person ,
i would watch mtv or something
that is why .
this is a movie ,
a so called action movie nevertheless .
so by definition it does not even really need a plot right ?
i am not agreeing 100 % ,
but let 's say yes to that .
so what does it need ?
20 minute footage from part 1
( i might be exaggerating a little bit ,
but it felt like more than 20 minute ... ) ? !
that would be `` no '' .
but then again you never know ,
the person
who watched part one might
not know
what they ate this morning for eakfast ,
so hey let 's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice ?
just to be sure
they will not forget ... at least until the credit roll 
of course ! ! ! !
so forget about the story ,
about character development 
about real emotion 
about the `` acting ''
( and no ,
i do not think
woman in skirt walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting ! )
... what does that leave ?
yes the action scene .
the action scene are not bad
and that is the reason
i gave the movie 2 star instead of 1 !
i was giving this movie a chance ,
but it was a waste of time ...
you have better thing to do/watch ,
believe me ...
