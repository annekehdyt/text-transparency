although this is not a `` great film 
''
there is something compelling and memorable about it .
like another commenter on the film 
i saw this in childhood .
it is been thirty three year since 1952 ,
but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title .
see it
if you have the opportunity .
you will feel like a voyeur of small town life
as it evolves through the decade .
more than any other film ,
this one ings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century `` progress . ''
it is engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one .
furthermore 
it is easy to like the character and watch their passage through time .
