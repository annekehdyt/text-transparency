i first saw this
when i was around 7. i remembered
what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place .
turns out now 
15 year later ,
that i remembered everything with great accuracy
because it seems the writer
never got beyond making an outline to the story .
there is no plot to this movie/cartoon .
there is no character development 
no back story 
no character arcs 
nothing .
the good guy do thing
because they are good ,
while the bad guy do thing
solely
because they are bad .
one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone
who you
would think to be important dy and nobody care in the least .
they just shrug their shoulder
and move on .
there is barely any dialogue either .
if you cut out the fight scene and the running scene ,
you lose 70 % of the movie.watch this
because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason .
or if you like to look at scan notily clad hot cartoon chick
( or scan notily clad hot cartoon dude ) .
