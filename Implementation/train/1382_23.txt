mirage
( 1990 )
is a very rare horror/chiller from 1990 ,
released here in the uk on the `` new world video '' label.it is a desert based horror film about a group of young friend
who are partying for the weekend ,
only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force
who drives a menacing black truck ! ! !
this film has some creepy scene 
and some gore here and there ,
but i have to say
that the acting was so lame 
even by low budget standard !
but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it ,
and i never fell asleep or turned it off ,
which is always a good sign !
i nearly gave this movie 6/10 ,
but seeing
as it built up steam along the way ,
had some good moment of gore and suspense ,
had some good nudity ,
and the fact
that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too !
i will give it 7/10 .
