for a film with so much promise
it was disappointing 
thinly plotted and the acting
ranging between horrendous and unbelievable.the plot had more hole in it than swiss cheese
and it is the worst clich\u00e9d
ending i have seen in a movie for some time .
the final scene would have ripped my heart out ,
if the entire movie had not been so painful
to begin with .
i was numb !
from the very first scene - one was left wondering ,
if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help ,
or simply scare her to death
which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hour of the worst acting i have seen to date .
it was a horror in the true sense of the word .
