as i have noticed with a lot of imdb comment ,
certain reviewer seem to demand
that every film
they see
have smugly intelligent plot
that wallow in there own cleverness .
i am not one of those person .
if i watch an action film ,
i want to see explosion 
gunfire and heroic .
if i watch a comedy ,
i want to have tear of laughter in my eye .
you get the idea .
therefore watching a horror film ,
i primarily want to be scared .
the grudge is a very scary film ,
in both it is well executed 'jump ' scene ,
and it is creepy imagery .
i have been a horror film fan for many year ,
and i am talking about the master such as dario argento 
rather than director of some of the treadmill teen horror flick
that are churned out these day .
if you want to be scared 
watch this film .
way scarier than the original japanese 'ring '
( which i also think
is a great film ) .
