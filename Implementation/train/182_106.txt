been lurking for a couple of year or so .
i have never been moved to post on here before ,
so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that ,
but i doubt it .
i just watched it on dvd ,
having missed it in the movie due to illness
and never got around to watching it till now .
i had not read extensively about it ,
certainly not even thought about the movie in some month .
it was just what the buddy picked up in the store ,
so it got watched.bad mistake.the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster .
right from the off ,
jason statham has hair .
like in no other gr movie .
or any js movie
that i have seen .
at least not in the quantity on display here .
and ray liotta in underpant should be advance warned .
it is scary
and funny but not in a ha-ha-humour way .
its more in an almost-theoffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-sort-of-humour way .
they each say
the same thing :
`` this movie is not like anything
you expect this movie to be .
`` now ,
based on previous 
extensive 
movie-watching experience ,
i expected this movie to be a few thing .
like :
( )
coherent 
( )
interesting or engaging 
( )
not a complete and utter farrago of navel-gazing ,
( )
something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly-realised fable from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a `` cool 
modern 
self-aware art-form '' ,
( )
hopefully better than `` the idiot '' .as
you may have guessed by my tone ,
it thoroughly failed to check any box above .
instead it was :
( x )
badly edited { pace all over the shop 
70s-amateur high-8 style jump cut 
incomprehensible `` plot '' `` twist ! ! ! ''
delivered through hackneyed flash-back montage ,
i could go on ... } ,
( x )
shot as if by a depressed 14yr-old goth
who 'd just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drape drawn
( x )
so up its own behind with the whole `` i am really smart 
me '' motif/ message ,
that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minute or so ,
just to make sure the dumb person
( ie :
everyone
who does not like it )
in the audience make sure
they get the point ,
( x )
a genuine waste of my time.as for the undoubted ability of some person
to `` get '' something from this 
fine .
i am glad you enjoyed it .
one poster said
something
that caught my attention :
under-25s probably understood it better
because of the editing .
maybe ,
but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible 
not less .
as for the `` genius is only recognised by the enlightened '' igade out there ,
go suck an onion
and grow up .
there is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than person
who say the reason
another person does not know
great art is because they do not understand the 'craft /material /moon cycle /filament of supreme rational thought '
which the 'auteur /poet/ artist/ palm reader/ idiot savant ' is using to explain his or her 'vision /grand scheme /oneness with gaea /great big bucket of dog-sick'.for me and many 
many more person 
its garbage .
movie 
art 
story 
poetry 
anything
designed to be viewed by another human
is supposed to be engaging and moving .
in some direction be it metaphorical 
spiritual 
emotional or whatever
you are having yourself.the only way this moved me was forward in time 
two hour closer to my own inevitable demise .
`` the greatest trick he ever pulled
was making you believe
any part of this movie meant anything at all '' and now 
please 
by all mean 
toast my buns for me .
