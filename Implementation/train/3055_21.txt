i saw this movie in 1976 
my first year of living in new york .
i went on to live there for the next 26 year ,
but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie .
it was part of a pbs series as i recall ,
and i have never forgotten it .
there are no sex scene to speak of 
just delicate 
moving 
extraordinarily touching moment full of tension and excitement ,
all set within a conservative 
boston
( i think ) ,
world war 1 environment
where woman played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war ,
and did not seek out a career and financial independence .
france lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer
and i have spent the next 30 odd year
searching for her in equally challenging role to no avail.there has to be a video of this movie ?
sure
it should be on dvd but surely at least a video ?
