this film was shot on location in gerard garden in liverpool ,
and was the uk 's answer to film such as 'blackboard jungle ' .
the film stands the test of time quite well ,
with all the moral story still
( or even more )
relevant today .
the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actor such as david mccallum 
stanley baker 
peter cushing and anne heywood .
baker plays a liverpool cop
assigned to juvenile liaison duty 
with the premise
that
if you catch the kid at an early age ,
they will end up being responsible adults.notable cameos in the film
include freddie starr
( fred fowell )
and melvyn haye
( gloria ) .
tsai chin and michael chow play other and sister
( they are real life other and sister )
who are caught up in an arsonist web .
tsai chin is still acting
and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor'.violent playground features a gun siege in a school ,
so is unlikely to be shown on tv
following similar event in scotland / russia.i
lived in gerard garden
where the film was shot
( though was not born at the time ) ,
and have fond memory of the area .
i have recently completed a documentary on gerard garden
which includes extract from 'violent playground ' 
and a small uk film 'coast to coast '
which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite .
the tenement were demolished in 1987
and the film go some way
in keeping the memory alive.there were some complaint from the resident
when the film was released ,
as the film portrayed the area in a bad light .
time has helped heal those wounds.a little gem of a film ,
i would recommend you seek this out
