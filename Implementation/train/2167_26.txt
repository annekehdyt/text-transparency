i do not pretend to be an authority on actor
who have played othello ,
but i have never witnessed a performance of the play 
on film or on stage ,
wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity.according to the biographical note ,
fishburne never received any professional training as an actor .
perhaps this explains
why his acting 
in this beautifully edited film 
comes over as so believable and so powerful .
instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered role ,
fishburne 's portrayal is focused more on othello 's love for his wife 
and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal 
than on violence and vengeance .
in a word 
the performance is understated ,
and made far more impressive by fishburne 's extremely intelligent interpretation
than it otherwise would have been.the acting throughout is superb ,
and the ( aidged ) speech gain grace from their light editing .
( even shakesspeare 
after all 
can be improved upon 
now and again
-- and if
that be treason ,
make the most of it !
