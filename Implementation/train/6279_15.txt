i do not know where to start ;
the acting 
the special effect and the writing are all about as bad
as you can possibly imagine .
i can not believe
that the production staff reached a point
where they said ,
`` our job is done ,
time for it is release '' .
i am just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk .
i would actually recommend watching this film
just so you can appreciate
how well made most film are.i do not know
how any of the other imdb user could find it scary
when the `` terrifying '' dinosaurs waddle down corridor with rubber arm flailing around .
