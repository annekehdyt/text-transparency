the story is similar to et :
an extraterrestrial run
around on earth
and try to come back home .
while its stay on our planet ,
it will create friendly ty with humans.but ,
unlike et
which exudes drama 
comedy 
poetry ,
this movie is only fun .
it is indeed a pure dysney production :
its core audience are child
and the movie is more more in the visual than in the message.thus ,
you will find some funny scene
( the first sighting of the town 
a `` cosmic '' stray toaster )
and the casting is experimented 
with special mention to `` doc '' ,
who rejuvenates in a `` mac fly '' character ,
and to hurley ,
who seems open to auto-derision.ice on the cake :
the main title is scored by danny elfman ,
and like every other great composer 
you recognize his `` voice ''
before he is even credited .
