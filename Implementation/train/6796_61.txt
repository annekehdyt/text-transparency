if one were to review the film
based on the premise alone ,
one might think
that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick .
the plot is as follows .
a group of documentary filmmaker head off to an island
in order to film a documentary about surfing with shark or blood surfing .
( i live in south africa
so it was released as `` blood surf . '' )
admittedly 
this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it
which ,
if it were explored further ,
could have improved the movie somewhat .
however 
this is not the case
as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact
that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt-water crocodile.the script
is absolutely terrible .
a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile
which is a frequent occurrence in this film ,
no one seems to give a damn .
the most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene
which was meant to be poignant
but just ended up being laughable due to the fact
that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature .
another thing
that really irritates about this film
is the fact
that they introduce character
who are totally superfluous to the film itself .
they introduce a bunch of pirate
who can only be seen
to be adding another 10 minute to a mercifully short film.the acting can be said to be mediocre .
it probably would have been a lot more impressive if
they did
not have such a terrible script
to work from .
all in all there is not one person
who made a terrible impact on me .
every single person seemed to be a watered-down caricature and in this way ,
not one of these actor made any sort of impact on me.the crocodile itself is said to be huge 
over 31 foot exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile
that they have provided for us in the film .
the crocodile 's death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived
that it makes one 's stomach turn .
with a huge cry of avado 
the hero of the film announce
that he has a plan
which turns out be falling down a hill
and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily-placed spike at the bottom of this said
hill.all in all 
i would say
that this film is one
which has to be seen for you
to believe
how bad it could be .
what probably seemed like a good idea at the time
suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low-budgetness
which all served to create a truly awful movie .
