scifi has been having some extremely bad luck
making quality movie lately
( such as minotaur or dog soldier ) .
grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf 
however ,
it deviates so much
( and offers so little in comparison )
that the advertisement on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty christopher lambert movie ' .
i was not expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production ,
but i did however expect the 'artistic integrity ' to not interfere with the actual story
( even if a little bit was changed
to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slot )
.did the director and producer have any idea
about what they were doing
( did any research go into this ? ) .
obviously not ,
as one could tell from the massive horned helmet
that beowulf and his crew
( save for mullet boy )
are wearing .
one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendel
if beowulf is supposed to wrestle him ,
should not he not have been sixteen foot tall and weigh 2 ton ?
grendel 's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script ;
for example : grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf \u0096
not cut off at the forearm
after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow
that looks like it weighs 300lbs !
and grendel 's mother did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies
when he succumbs to his wound ?
and honestly 
what the hell was with that mullet ?
if you want to see this movie
because its connection to the epic .do not ,
as there really is not one
( other than character name ) .
the only way i could recommend this film
is
if you liked the movie druid
( directed by jacque dorfmann )
\u0096
although i do not recommend watching either .
