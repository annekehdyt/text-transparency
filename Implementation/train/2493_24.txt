two house 
one street 
one phone booth ,
one car 
a girl next door 
a boy next door and a zombie .
this list of ingredient should suffice for a great horror movie .
all you need is some blue light 
ambient music and ... done .
not in the hand of dutch director van rouveroy though !
i like to organize `` bad movie evening '' from time to time .
the concept is really simple :
get some booze 
get some film-loving friend ,
and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer .
for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best .
laugh guaranteed !
the bizarre thing is ,
van rouveroy is still defending her film
as if it were a great achievement .
to be a witness to this you
will have to listen to the dvd 's commentary track .
again :
disbelieve and laugh guaranteed !
