a mess of genre
but it is mainly based on stephen chow 's genre mash-up
for it is inspiration .
there is magic kung-fu 
college romance 
sport 
gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping .
the production is excellent
and the pacing is fast
so it is easy to get past the many flaw in this film.a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court .
a homeless man ings him to a shaolin monastery
that is in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual
that the homeless man somehow has but can not read .
the old monk teaches the boy but expires
when he tries to master the special technique in the manual .
the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master
who is assisted by four wacky monk .
the new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master 's weak punch
and throws him out for the night .
the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man
who ing him to a gangster 's club to play dart .
this leads to a big fight 
the boy 's expulsion from the monastery and the man 's decision
to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation.al
this
happens in the first 20 minute with most of it happening in the first 10 minute .
aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character
until way into the movie .
the man
who uses the boy
is more sharply defined by the time
the first third
is over .
the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film .
i am sure
you can easily imagine
how the wacky monk will show up toward the end .
the effect 
photography and stunt work are all top- notch
and make up for the uninspired plot .
stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing
and this film will live in his shadow
but that is not a good reason
to ignore it .
it is quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending .
recommended .
