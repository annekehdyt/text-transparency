i rented this movie on the merit
of what the trailer showed ,
and of course sir anthony hopkin.if jackson pollack teamed up with david lynch 
and timothy leary
to make a movie ,
this would be the end result .
i do not think
i have seen a movie
like it
that made an lsd trip look like an episode of sesame street.it is a bunch of set piece
where the character flash in and out of reality 
or various reality 
and the film does not culminate into anything until the last 5 minute ,
where all of a sudden it makes sense .
i wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog
that essentially gives everything away ,
and i will not do that here .
it is a well acted piece of cinema ,
and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkin ,
and let me say this ,
if there is one redeeming feature to this film ,
it is the music .
it fits perfectly .
some of the dialogue is unbelievably good ,
and unbelievably bad all at the same time.i enjoyed part of this movie ,
i truly did ,
and
once you get to the end of it ,
you will actually figure out what is truly going on .
it is unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hour of crazy
to get to a salient point ,
which minimizes the effect of the entire movie.i give it a 3/10 for the simple fact
that the real problem with this film is not the acting ,
it is everything .
