*soiler* it is fake !
the whole thing is a fake !
there is no ghost or zombie ,
alan is a lord and his cousin or other or half other or something
like that wants the castle and his title for himself .
so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby-doo to drive alan
to commit suicide .
most of the movie is him picking up redhead and attacking them .
he is not even killing them .
he drops off to sleep and the girl vanish
and he thinks
he buried them someplace .
if he looked at the so-called ghost of evelyn ,
he could tell
she was wearing glove !
my god what a waste of time .
do not bother watching it ,
renting and if you bought it
and have not watched it yet ,
sell it .
quickly !
do yourself a favor
and stay away from the night evelyn
came out of the grave .
i give this stinker the crap-o-lantern .
