few movie can be viewed almost 60 year later ,
yet remain as engrossing as this one .
technological advance have not dated this classic love story .
special effect used are remarkable for a 1946 movie .
the acting is superb .
david niven 
kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job .
the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie .
it has not been seen on television for 20 year
so few person are even aware of its existence .
it is my favorite movie of all time .
waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many year is 
in itself 
`` a matter of life and death '' .
