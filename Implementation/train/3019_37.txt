( sorry for my faulty language ,
i am no native speaker ... )
yes 
this is a movie
that almost demands an overwhelming reaction .
personally i agree upon all those superlative
that are around .
but i will not use this rather sematically void way
myself to describe the movie here .
because those `` perfect !
the one-and-only !
best-ever !
`` -review make some person turn away
( including me )
.so
if you are looking for another 'hamlet '
that has the potential
to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic one -
then do not miss this one ,
if you happen to find it anywhere .
( unfortunately not too many person will have any chance
to see it .
it seems
there is no dvd out there ,
and the german language version -
which is quite well done -
is not available in any format .
) just in case you decide to get a copy :
spare out
that cut down two hour
( or so )
version of this movie .
it is no use and no fun ,
and gives a wrong impression of a movie ,
that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture .
and its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio.greeting from germany 
f.l .
