a year after losing gorgeous jane parker
( maureen o'sullivan )
to love rival tarzan 
hunter harry holt
( neil hamilton )
returns to the jungle
to have another bash at winning the unette babe 's heart .
mixing business with pleasure 
he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard
that lies beyond the mutia escarpment 
tarzan 's stomping ground.accompanied by his slimy 
womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearer 
harry finally arrives at his destination
( having narrowly avoided death at the hand of savage native and rock-hurling apes )
only to find
that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller 
and worse still ,
that tarzan is refusing to let the hunter take any ivory from the graveyard.nasty arlington decide to resolve matter by ambushing
and shooting the ape-man and then telling jane and holt
that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile .
of course 
tarzan is not dead\u0097only wounded ;
after being nursed back to health by cheetah
( !
) 
he swing back into action just in time
to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savage
who have attacked holt 's expedition.tarzan and his mate 
the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few word ,
is often cited by fan as the best of the series ;
although i slightly prefer the original ,
i can definitely understand the film 's popularity :
it is damn sexy
and there are some great action sequence !
the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous
and leads to some pretty steamy scene ,
and with both star wearing eensy-weensy outfit throughout 
there is eye-candy aplenty for viewer of both sex
to enjoy
( despite o'sullivan 's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double ,
the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin ,
even threatening to do a 'sharon stone ' at one point
as her loin cloth flap to one side !
) .the film 's most exciting moment come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile 
and the spectacular final\u00e9
where jane is attacked by lion and native ,
but is rescued by her beau 
his monkey pal 
and a load of elephant in full-on lion-crushing mode
( once again ,
the violence is surprisingly nasty at time ,
although as far as i am concerned ,
there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmy and their gorilla pit from the first film ) .
cheetah also has his fair share of excitement 
dodging rhino 
crocs 
and big cat ,
riding on tarzan 's back
as he crosses a river ,
and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride.like
it is predecessor ,
tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effect and unconvincing props\u0097dodgy back projection 
a few laughable monkey suit 
more indian elephant masquerading as their african cousin ,
and poorly disguised trapeze swing\u0097but these should not spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film .
if anything 
they make it even more fun ! 8.5/10 
rounded up to 9 for imdb .
