this game show lasted just one season ,
but was intriguing to audience
because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand .
one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize ,
even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer .
it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing ,
wondering
if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out ;
allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest .
it was a light-hearted show ,
but it was clear that the contestant were often time embarrassed from a silly mistake
made unintentionally .
rarely seen 
the game show did not survive past one single season .
only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show ,
as it proved to be quite unpopular ,
even though game show were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandal of the 1950 's game show .
but it was a unique concept for a game show ,
and one
that has as yet never been seen again .
