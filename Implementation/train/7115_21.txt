i am not sure this is a spoiler ;
perhaps it is a public service .
if you are one of those person
focused on instant gratification
who skip end credit ,
you will miss the final line of the end credit news announcer 's voice-over ,
which states the u.s. has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7 
1945 to end wwii .
here are just a few of the problem with this close :
1 ) the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movie in their mind 's eye
to fill in the yawning chasm between movie event and this startling conclusion.2 )
the average person will really kick themselves
that they did not `` watch '' one of these unholy fill-in-the-blanks flick
created in their own head for free ,
instead of shelling out time and money
to see this unholy from the video store
( or on cable ) .3 )
this end credit sequence of imagined news bulletin may be the first information
some younger viewer are exposed to about wwii ,
leading them to the conclusion
that george w. bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne .
