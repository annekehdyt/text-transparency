this film is excellently paced ,
you never have to wait for a belly laugh
to come up for more than about a minute
and there is much more going on than the initial premise of the film .
throughout it there are mockery of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parody .
do not let anyone tell you
that they are trying to get cheap laugh just by using obscenity ;
- sure ,
there is plenty of that
but it is all contextual 
not gratuitous .
i loved this film
and it only cost me \u00a32.99 on dvd 
so in term of entertainment value for money ,
it has been the best film i have seen this year .
