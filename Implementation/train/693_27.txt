seeing as i hate
reading long essay hoping to find a point
and being disappointed ,
i will first tell everyone
that this movie was terrible .
downright terrible .
and not 
surprisingly for the reason mentioned in the first review .
i thought
i might agree with him ,
seeing
as he gave the movie the rank it deserved ,
but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading
what he said .
i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone
who commented
that the movie `` definitely lacks good-looking female . ''
let me be the first to say 
`` wow !
that was definitely some serious in-depth
reviewing there .
my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musing about this movie . ''
seriously though 
a lack of `` good-looking female '' should not be considered an essential to a movie .
if you are desperate enough for `` good-looking female ''
you should really watch other type of movie ,
not necessarily falling into the sci-fi category .
