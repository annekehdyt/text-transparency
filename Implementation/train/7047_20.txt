capture what can only be described as a true to life
setting in the panhandle of florida .

to the lack of work 
the echo of what life is really like on the `` red-neck riviera '' provide rough choice for the young girl .

and learns to be her own woman 
with a strength that flows from within .

that of `` ulee 's gold '' in 1997
