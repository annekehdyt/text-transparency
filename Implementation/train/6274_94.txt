so on the chill network on cable
they are having `` vampire month '' ,
i am such a dork 
but i love vampire .
so after a few dud
that
they showed i
was pretty disappointed ,
but then i noticed sleepwalker was written by stephen king .
so i decided to go ahead
and check it out ,
well much to my surprise ,
this movie was really bad .
most stephen king film are entertaining
and some are very scary .
while sleepwalker was bad ,
it was a beautiful kind of bad .
i had a good time laughing at this movie
and just taking it for what it was .
i have never read sleepwalker ,
from what i understand
this is the only real vampire story by king ,
so i can not really compare book to film .
i do not know
if it was just my tv ,
but sleepwalker looked like it was made for tv .
the special effect were corny
and the story was a bit far fetched ,
even if it is fantasy ,
it had a lot of problem .
charle brady and his mother mary are vampire
who feed off the life force of virgin woman .
they are considerably more resilient than human
and have power of both telekinesis and illusion .
their one weakness is cat ,
who are not only able to see through their illusion
but whose claw are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wound upon them .
they also maintain an incestuous relationship .
charle and mary have taken up residence in a small indiana town .
charle attends the local high school ,
and there he meets tanya robertson in his creative writing class .
tanya does not suspect the real reason
why charle wants her so much ;
to take her life force for his mother ,
who is starving .
at first 
it seems that charle has fallen in love with tanya .
on their first date 
however 
a picnic at the nearby cemetery 
charle attempt to drain the life force from tanya
while kissing her .
as it happens ,
deputy sheriff andy simpson
who had earlier
tried to pull charle over for speeding 
drife by the cemetery and notice charle ' car .
when tanya runs to him for help ,
charle track andy down and kill him .
when charle then turns to resume his life force-depleting make out session with tanya 
the deputy 's cat 
clovis 
rises to the occasion and nearly kill charle by scratching him in the face and chest .
mortally wounded by clovis ,
charle stagger back home to mary .
mary then seeks vengeance on tanya 's family.so to sum this movie
up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow .
the scene
where charle attack tanya for the first time
is very clich\u00e9
and you almost vote for charle
to win
just
because tanya is one of the dumbest female lead in horror movie .
then you got ta love the scene
where mary has a gun
and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explode 
god bless hollywood explosion and exaggeration .
i am taking the movie for what it is ,
it is just so deliciously bad
that it turns into a dark comedy for me
that i could just enjoy making fun of .
i am not sure
if this is what stephen king wanted to see for his story ,
but he does have his typical cameo in the film .
so my suggestion
if you watch this movie ,
just take it for what it is
and do not over think it ,
it is mindless entertainment with corny effect 
bad casting 
a silly story and enough cat
to make the crazy cat lady from the simpson 's say `` wow ,
that is a lot of cat '' .4/10
