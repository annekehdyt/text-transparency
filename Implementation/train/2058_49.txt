once in the life means
that once a hoodlum 
always a hoodlum ,
and nobody gets in or out of `the life ' for free .
neighborhood hoodlum in new york sell drug and run scam
because they can not make it in the legitimate world ,
maybe
because they have a criminal record 
or a drug habit ,
or because they are just lazy .
this simple story with a couple of twist about mostly despicable character
manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main player
because of their loyalty and compassion for each other .
the film is written ,
produced ,
and directed by laurence fishburne ,
who also stars as 20/20 mike
( all hoodlum have nickname ) ,
and is based on his play 
`riff raff . '
it feels like a play from beginning to end 
especially during the longest scene
where the three main player square off
to decide
who can be trusted .
often times the dialog comes very fast ,
much faster
than it would on stage ,
and i think
it is the film 's biggest flaw .
mixed in as flashback throughout the film are poems from the street 
a sort of iambic pentameter rap ,
that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses .
the poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these man 
these hoodlum
who murder 
cheat ,
and betray each other 
as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt .
the disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these person live ,
but how they suffer for the same reason
as us all .
one is too stupid 
another a junkie 
and the last suffer from conscience
while the audience wonder 
or even laugh 
at the irony of executioner demanding from him hanging in the gallows
to tell joke in the midst of his demise .
