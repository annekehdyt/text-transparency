in this film we have the fabulous opportunity
to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film
when they are not shown -
which is a lot !
this film even goes back to before simba and ( presumbably )
just after the birth of kiara .
quite true to the first film 
`` lion king 1/2
( or lion king 3 in other place ) ''
is a funny 
entertaining 
exciting and surprising film
( or sequel if that is what you want to call it ) .
a bundle of surprise and hilarity await for you !
while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema
( with a remote control ) ,
timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of `` the lion king ''
they are going to start watching ,
as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning .
they have a very fair compromise
of watching the film of their own story ,
which is what awaits ...
it starts with timon 's first home ... for anyone with a good sense of humour
who liked the first film of just about any age ,
enjoy `` lion king 1/2 '' !
