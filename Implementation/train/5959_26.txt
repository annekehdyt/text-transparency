if you want to know what kind of music white person
listened to in 1974 ,
this is the movie for you .
but you will have to listen to a lot of flute and violin ,
too
( see my remark on my girl 1 for the reference )
.indulgent admission :
i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance ,
having just viewed its predecessor .
but as an adoptee
preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother ,
my girl 2 made me look 
with its theme of searching for mother.put another way ,
anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2 ,
but relating to a protagonist
who asks ,
like so many adoptee ,
`` who 's my mama '' ?
and if there are home movie of my mom in an acting troupe ,
i will be sure to make my own movie about it.person are listless .
movie should not be listless .
my girl 2
( like my girl 1 )
is just ... listless.avoid
unless you are a complete sap
who 's comforted by a series of small annoyance .
