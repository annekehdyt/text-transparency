beautiful film 
pure cassavete style .
gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress ,
dealing with success 
aging 
loneliness ... and alcoholism .
she tries to escape her own subconscious ghost 
embodied by the death spectre of a young girl .
acceptance of oneself 
of human condition 
though its overall difficulty 
is the real purpose of the film .
the parallel between the theatrical sequence and the film itself are puzzling :
it is like
if the stage became a way out for the heroin .
if all american movie could only be that top-quality 
dealing with human relation on an adult level ,
not trying to infantilize and standardize feeling ... one of the best dramas ever .
10/10 .
