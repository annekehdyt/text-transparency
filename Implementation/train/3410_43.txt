i was not expecting much ,
and 
to be honest ,
i did not like this film the first time around
but watching it again and i realised
that it is kinda cool .
sure 
it is a one joke film
but it is a funny gag .
someone posted
that it could be better written
and it could be .
i think
this film had the potential
to be a over-the-top my cousin vinny .
but with a horror host instead of a lawyer .
sadly it is a wasted opportunity .
with just a bit more writing
it could be a classic .
the kid are underused there is no reason
why they should latch on to elvira .
apart from the obvious reason .
it would have been great to see their relationship flourish .
i know
it is a comedy
but it is little difference
that separate the good film from the illiant.elvira herself is always fun and engaging .
not to mention flirty .
every time
she smiles
you will too .
it is hard to knock a film
when the main character is so charming .
and it really is her charm ,
do not let her looks fool you into thinking
that she is some sort of tart .
well she is .
but she is a nice one .
the sort of person you would let look after your kid .
would not let her cook for them ,
though ... i would recommend giving it a go .
just do not expect too much.she is more than just a great set of boobs .
she is also an incredible pair of leg .
