some guy think
that sniper is not good
because of the action part of it was not good enough .
well ,
if you regard it as an action movie ,
this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting .
however 
i think
this is a psychological drama
rather than an action one.the movie mainly told us about the inside of two sniper
who definitely had different personality and different experience .
tomas beccket ,
who was a veteran
and had 74 confirmed kill ,
looked as if he was cold-hearted .
however ,
after beccket showed his day dream of montana ,
we can clearly see his softness inside .
it was the cruel war and his partner ' sacrifice
that made beccket become so called cold-hearted.millar ,
on the contrary 
was a new comer 
a green hand ,
and was even not qualified as a sniper .
billy zane did quite well to show millar 's hesitation and fear
when he first tried to `` put a bullet through one 's heart ''
( as what beccket said ) .
what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was
that it could be easily accomplished
and then he could safely get back
and receive the award.these two guy were quite different in their personality and i think
that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personality .
these two sniper quarreled 
suspected each other
and finally come to an understanding by the communication
and by what they had done
to help even to save the other.sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one .
