most person
who chase
after movie featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand
that amelie was a character -
it is not really audrey tautou 's real life personality 
hence 
every movie
she partakes in
is not going to be amelie part 2 
part 3 ,
etc.now with that said ,
i too picked up this movie
simply because audrey was in it .
yes ,
it is true ,
there is a big gap after the first scene
where she is not seen at all for maybe 45 min ,
but i did not even miss her
because i was having so much fun with the other character .
the guy
who lies about everything
is too funny 
the guy
who justifies person
who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill
by finding coupon and such
which balance out the loss ,
actually ... .
getting into all the character here
could take quite a while ,
but this is one of the best movie i have seen in a while.audrey tautou 's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl
that amelie was .
in fact 
as irene 
her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first .
in this film 
irene is a girl with good intention ,
but over the course of a
( very awful ) day 
her disposition becomes more and more smy and pessimistic.what makes this film
completely great is you have all these really interesting story and plot building ... very entertaining to watch 
great scenery and shot 
very colorful
and never too slow ,
and all of the character can actually act .
the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minute left ... .
this is when all of the plot start to mesh together
and the ride really picks up and everything ty together
and makes sense ,
and the whole butterfly effect blossom .
i swear ,
it was the best 20 minute of film i
have seen in quite a while ,
and the ending ... .
it made me think
`` damn i really lucked out finding this movie '' .
the ending to this movie is top notch .
whoever wrote the script for this is illiant ,
because not only are there all these other subplot going on ,
but to somehow make them all tie in together
( and in a sensible manner ,
which is the case here )
but also to make each character feel human and come alive ,
not just some stale persona used as a crutch
to build up this whole butterfly effect ...
very impressive.i highly suggest this movie
as it is a great film to watch anytime 
in any mood 
with any company or alone .
