well well well .
as good as john carpenter 's season 1 outing in `` master of horror '' was ,
this is the complete opposite .
he certainly proved
he was still a master of horror with `` cigarette burn ''
but `` pro-life '' is perhaps the worst i
have seen from him.it
is stupid 
totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension
and it overstays it is welcome ,
despite the less-than-an-hour running time .
the script is nonsense ,
the character are irritable and un-appealing
and the conclusion is beyond absurd.and for those sucker
who actually bought the dvd
( one of them being me ) ;
did you see
how carpenter describes the film ?
he is actually proud of it
and he talks about it as his best work for a long time ,
and he praises the script .
and in the commentary track ,
where he notices an obvious screw up
that made it to the final cut ,
he just says
he did not feel it essential to rectify the mistake
and he just let it be there .
i fear
the old master has completely lost his touch .
i sincerely hope
i am proved wrong.i want to leave on a positive note and mention
that the creature effect are awesome 
though .
technically speaking ,
this film is top notch 
with effective lighting scheme
and make up effect .
