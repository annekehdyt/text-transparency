as someone
who has both read the novel and seen the film ,
i have a different take
on why the film was such a flop .
first 
any comparison between novel and film are purely superficial .
they are two different animals.the novel is probably intended as a satire ,
but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead .
any comedic elemant such as those
which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version
are merely incidental to the author 's uniformly cynical thrust .
and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you
into thinking this
is another mark twain ,
think again .
a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of amose bierce in a top hat and tail .
tom wolfe is equal part clown and hack 
more celeity than author ,
always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill .
it is therefore no wonder
that the excellent production skill and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start .
unlike true satire ,
which translates very well into film ,
polemic are grounded not in universally accessible observation on some form or other of human behavior ,
but in a single-minded attack on specific person
-- whether real or fictional straw man --
who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer .
any effort
to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning
must have a clean start 
free of the writer 's influence or interference.having said
that 
i too find fault with the casting .
it is not merely that incompetent like bruce willi and melanie griffith fail to measure up ,
but that real talent like tom hank 
f. murray aaham 
and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given role
that are mere caricatures.there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire ,
but it fails to come even close .
