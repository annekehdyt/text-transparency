i wish
kid movie were still made this way ; dark and deep .
there was ( get this ) character development
( and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character ) ,
plot development 
superb animation 
emotional involvement 
and a rational 
relatable 
and consistent theme .
if not for the handful of song-and-dance routine ,
you would never have thought
this was a kid movie ,
and this is why i give it such a high rating .
this movie is an excellent film ,
let alone for a kid ' movie .
which ings me to my second point :
this has got to be the darkest `` kid ' '' movie i
have seen in quite some time ,
this coming from a 22-year-old .
i would be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie ,
and it all ends with one of the saddest ending
you could ever come across
( ala `` jurassic bark '' 
for those of you
who are 'futurama ' fan ) ,
and this is what makes this movie so good .
just because the movie universally evokes emotion we do not normally like to feel
and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad ;
in fact 
it means it succeeded .
good funny movie are supposed to make us laugh ;
good horror movie are supposed to make us scared ;
good sad movie are supposed to make us sad .
my point is 
good movie are supposed to move you ,
not simply entertain ;
this movie moved me.also ,
this movie is incredibly violent by today 's standard for a kid ' movie
and contain subject matter
that 
by today 's standard 
may not be suitable for some child .
parent 
i would say watch it first .
i am not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing ,
but i just saw this yesterday
and it came as a surprise even to me .
