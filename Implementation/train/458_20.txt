absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch ...
i highly recommend this movie .
her performance 
in my opinion 
was academy award material !
the only real sad fact here is that universal has not seen to it
that this movie was ever available on any video format ,
whether it be tape or dvd .
they are ignoring a very good movie .
but universal has little regard for its liary on dvd ,
which is sad .
if you get the chance to see this somewhere
( not sure
why it is rarely even run on cable ) ,
see it !
i will not go into the story
because i think
most person would rather have an opinion on the film ,
and too many `` reviewer '' spend hour writing about the story ,
which is available anywhere.a 10 !
