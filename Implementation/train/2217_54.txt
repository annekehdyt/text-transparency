first of all 
let 's get a few thing straight here :
a )
i am an anime fan-
always has been as a matter of fact
( i used to watch speed
racer all the time in preschool ) .
b )
i do like several b-movie
because they are hilarious .
c )
i like the godzilla movies- a lot.moving on ,
when the movie first comes on ,
it seems like it is going to be your usual b-movie 
down to the crappy fx 
but all a sudden- boom !
the anime comes on !
this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill.the animation is very bad and cheap 
even worse than what i remember from speed racer 
for crissake !
in fact 
it is so cheap 
one of the few scene from the movie i `` vividly '' remember
is when a bunch of kid run out of a school ...
and it is the same kid over and over again !
the fx are terrible 
too ;
the dinosaur look worse than godzilla .
in addition 
the transition to live action to animation is unorganized 
the dialogue and voice
( especially the english dub
that i viewed )
was horrid
and i was begging my dad
to take the tape out of the dvd/ vhs player ;
the only thing
that kept me surviving
was cracking out joke and comment like the robot and joel/mike on mst3k
( you pick the season ) .
honestly 
this is the only way
to barely enjoy this movie
and survive it at the same time.heck ,
i am planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b-movie night .
because it is stupid ,
pretty painful to watch and unintentionally hilarious at the same time ,
i am giving this movie a 3/10 ,
an improvement from the 0.5/10 i was originally going to give it .
( according to my grading scale :
3/10 mean pretty much both boring and bad .
as fun as counting to three unless you find a way
to make fun of it ,
then it will become as fun as counting to 15 . )
