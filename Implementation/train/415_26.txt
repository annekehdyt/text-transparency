while rehearing carman of bizet 
the middle-aged choreographer antonio
( antonio gade )
ings the sexy carman
( laura del sol )
to perform the lead role .
antonio falls in love for carman ,
who is an independent and seductive woman incapable
to accept a possessive love .
when carman has an affair with another dancer ,
antonio is consumed by his jealousy like d. jos\u00e9 in the original opera 
entwining fiction with reality .
`` carman '' is another great movie of carlos saura 's trilogy
dedicated to the flamenco dance .
the dramatic love story is developed with the life of the artist entwined with the character
they are rehearsing ,
and many time is not absolutely clear
whether what is happening is reality
( with the dancer )
or fiction
( of the play ) .
paco de lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous bizet 's opera ,
which is based on the novel of prosper m\u00e9rim\u00e9e .
