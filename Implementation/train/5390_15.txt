i loved the the film .
it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society ,
how the leftist of the 70 have given up all their ideal and come to a happy arrangement
which they do not want disturbed .
for instance 
the aging psychoanalyst
who is jealous of his own son ,
and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth.for a long time
wanted to buy the video
after having seen the movie a couple of time on the big screen and on tv ,
but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market ,
even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film .
a great pity.the one sex scene ,
which everyone seems to go on about ,
does the film no harm .
