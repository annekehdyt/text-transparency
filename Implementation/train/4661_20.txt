cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic
that appears fascinating
( except for the dragon prop ) .
now just how did the long-gone studio known for chuck norris movie ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place ?
case in point :
the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign
that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution .
they actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundred of lusty bimbo ,
just to make this look even better .
for the two `` barbarian brother '' 
they sure know how to make weird noise
than becoming ave warrior so strong and bold enough
to save their native land .
this is the single greatest waste of potential i
have seen from an `` expensive '' low-budget movie ,
and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print
without mercy .
all of this followed an advertising campaign
that sold t-shirt based on the barbarian !
the movie alone makes a great souvenir !
