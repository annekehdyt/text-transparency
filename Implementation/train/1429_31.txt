i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2 ,
but this is possibly worse than both title .
first of all 
i did not like the animation 
very saturday-morning-cartoon 
only worse in some scene .
i liked some of the character 
namely thunderbolt and patch ,
but the other character 
like cruella were mediocre .
cruella was truly villainous in the original ,
but she lost her quality in the sequel .
what she said
was nothing at all
to write home about and her animation
was kind of ugly .
also her artist companion lar was a joke
to be honest with you ,
and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight .
the voice talent were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt 
with the exception of jodi benson 
the accent ruined it for me .
there were some good moment ,
but the whole plot seemed bloated for me 
and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode .
all in all 
a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movie along with jungle book .
sorry 
i can only give this a 3/10 ,
it just was not my cup of tea .
