overrated and only for those person in their 20 's whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glass ,
who never actually saw it in the first place
because they were to young .
awful animation 
dialogue and a tired narrative .
a real product of the 80 's 
the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy
( that right 
toy not the absurd 
pretentious and child alienating `` collector action figurine '' ) ,
sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia ,
only matter to those
who bought the toy
when they were `` actual '' child in the period of '84 ' to '87 ' .
it has become cult
because of those same adult are to immature
to let go of their memory .
avoid .
