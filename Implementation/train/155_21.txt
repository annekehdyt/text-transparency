first and foremost i would like to say
that i am a huge sarah silverman fan ,
and having other person
say
that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me .
everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form ,
maybe not directly funny ,
but the situation and the delivery are what counts.if you liked jesus is magic
then i do not see
how you would not like this .
it has that same flow and that same rhythm .
true it is only for the true fan ,
but
if you are you
will be pleased.again only for the true fan ,
there is no way around that .
if you are not used to her style
then you would not get why this is funny .
however 
it is ,
and i hope you think so too .
