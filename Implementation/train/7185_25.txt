this movie is one of the worst one of the year .
the main character have no chemistry
and the acting is horrible .
paul rudd is the only one
that has any talent ,
and the only one that is not annoying .
i have never watched desparte housewife ,
so i do not know
how eva longoria is on that show ,
but in this movie she was horrible .
it is like she knows nothing about acting .
all her character does is whine throughout the film ,
and she can not pull off being a b****
and still be entertaining .
and the other girl 
lake bell 
displays little emotion
and it is like you are looking at the cue card
as she reads them.as for the story ,
it is so cookie cutter .
it goes from point a to b with little surprise .
so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost .
the plot should have revolved more around her and the thing
she does as a spirit.final verdict :
it is not worth watching .
