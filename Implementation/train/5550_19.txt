this series has its up and occasional down ,
and the latter is the case 
here .
there is an agreeable amount of spatter 
with an inventive implementation of the baby cart 's weapon ,
but the editing film is a seriously disjointed ,
the film-making itself rougher than usual .
at time 
the action slows to a crawl
as the camera follows the wordless wandering of the `` cub 
''
who nearly gets lost early on .
all in all ,
disappointment.that said ,
there is a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action
that may win the approval of dedicated viewer .
this installment spends much of its time
following the minor misadventure of the little boy ,
who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him .
