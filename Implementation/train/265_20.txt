definitely the worst movie i have ever seen ...
can somebody tell me
where should have i laughed ?
there is not a single hint or shadow of an idea .
the three leading actor are pestilential 
especially the one
( i think
it is aldo )
from sicily
who _can not_
make a sicilian accent ! ! !
not to say about the dream-like insertion about dracula ... just another expedient ,
drawn from the worst cabaret tradition ,
to make this `` film '' last a little longer .
massironi and littizzetto do what they can ,
but this so-called movie was really too ,
too hard to rescue .
i would have given it `` 0 '' /10 ,
but the lowest mark was 1/10
and so i had to overestimate it by one mark .
