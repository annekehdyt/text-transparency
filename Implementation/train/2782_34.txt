i see where a few person
involved in this debacle
wrote review to share their side of the story ,
and i thought
what they wrote was helpful in understanding it .
the fact
that they basically came up with excuse
-- rewrite 
budget constraint 
production format etc --
simply underlines how bad this movie is .
and my criticism in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning
that this one does not make the cut.it is watchable ,
but barely so .
there are plot hole in every corner ,
the dialogue border on the ridiculous ,
and the ending is telegraphed a mile away .
the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like
who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy .
would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally ,
between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweeper ?
apparently this elite team
equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder
armor has no access to mre .
once they get into the last room
they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is
that it can not be killed single handedly .
yet only one scene ago 
the hero making
that case abandoned king to do exactly that .
huh ?
vivian woo was attractive
and hands down the best acted character in the movie .
but that is not saying much .
