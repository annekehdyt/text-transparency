johnnie to 's election has some cool music on the opening credit\u0097and a nice opening credit ' design too 
a kaleidoscope of chinese character and those asian mobster solemnly
taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff ;
as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored .
i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist
and was quite eager to see a to movie .
the one
with which i began 
election ,
is exciting and interesting ,
and only moderately violent by nowaday standards\u0097moderately
and also essentially violent ;
the story of an asian godfather 's scheming 
it uses a puzzle play of element ,
violent fact from the mobster ' life 
the race for the scepter 
true detail ,
and as with coppola we are expected to believe
that some of the morally glamorized mobster are entitled and nice and likable .
the performance are reasonably amusing
and colorful.election is well made in the enjoyable 
somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare ;
the ending is bitter 
true 
straight
and will scare the kid .
