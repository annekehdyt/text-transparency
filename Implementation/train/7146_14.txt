when philo vance
( edmund lowe )
is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city 
apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death ,
it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine year later 
`` the woman in green ''
in which sherlock holme
( basil rathbone )
is similarly about to hurl himself into space
while being hypnotized .
happily 
both philo vance and sherlock holme survive these attempt at murder by unscrupulous criminal .
exciting cinematic suspense in both these scene .
when will they learn you can not cloud the mind of great fictional detective ?
