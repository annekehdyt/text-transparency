this is not `` so bad
that it is good 
''
it is purely good !
for those
who do not understand why ,
you have the intellect of a four year old
( in response to a certain comment ... )
anyway 
killer tomato eat france is a parody of itself 
a parody of you 
and a parody of me .
it is the single most genius text in cinematic history .
i have it and the three prequel sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa .
it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermine all
that you or me call standard .
i write script
and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me ,
the like of which we have never seen .
it can only be taken in portion ... its sort of exploitive ...
by now i am just trying to take up the ten line minimum .
my comment ended a while ago .
hopefully it works
when i submit it now .
