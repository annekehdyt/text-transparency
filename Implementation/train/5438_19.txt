i was really stunned how much a film ,
that is over 60 year old could impress me .
it is nearly two hour long ,
there are absolutely no star in it ,
there are subtitle
but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch .
what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film .
you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice ,
because you could see
that the storm are real .
this is a relief in a cgi-world like ourday .
i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke .
i read somewhere
that it took 17 month to film it .
now who wants to talk about 'titanic ' anymore ?
it is a great film with a great message
and i would recommend it to future director
to see how great and realistic movie can be
if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effect .
