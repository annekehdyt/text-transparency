i have to say
that this is one of the best movie i
have ever seen !
i was bored
and looked through the t.v .
and found `` home room ''
and it was already in about 5 min. ,
but i got hooked .
it was so interesting and moving .
it shows what can happen in anyone 's life .
i give it a 10 
more if possible .
the director/ writer and actor did an amazing job .
i think
teen should watch this movie
and will learn from it .
it was great 
drama 
mystery 
and more .
i cried for hour !
i think
that the director/ writer should write more movie like this one .
i loved it !
i did not even know about this movie ,
which is sad
because it was so good .
i wish
it could go in the movie for more person to see .
