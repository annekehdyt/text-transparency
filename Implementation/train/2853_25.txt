why bother seeing this movie ,
if you have great movie to see .
it is a total waste of time and money .
the movie is so bad
that i felt bad for wanting to watching it .
everything in it is bad .
actor were bad .
script was really bad .
the story is stupid .
and the worst cgi ever .
the only good moment were the first 60 second of the movie in the strip club .
one interesting thing that 
there is a characther
that we wish
that
he dies because ,
he is so stupid
that we get enough of him .
( i do not remember the name
but was the boyfriend of the `` chosen one '' .
)
note :
if you want to see a good movie ,
this movie is not the right choice .
0-star out of 10
