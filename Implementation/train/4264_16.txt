this sci-fi adventure is not the best
and by no means the worst .
i agree with the statement
that bad sci-fi is comical .
bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effect make this a favorite for the late 
late ,
late show viewer .
space explorer on the planet mar fight off strange giant amoeba-like monster and other strange creature .
pretty cool.the cast includes les tremayne 
naura hayden 
gerald mohr and jack kruschen .
get comfy and enjoy .
do not feel bad
if you nod off for a moment .
i agree
with adding this to the list of cult classic to not miss .
