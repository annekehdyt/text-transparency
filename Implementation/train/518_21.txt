i actually found this movie 'interesting ' ;
finally one worth my time to watch and rent .
it is true ...
some scene were over the top on emotionalism ,
shouting 
etc. ,
but what movie does not stress its agenda 
genre or 'ax to grind ' ?
almost none !
what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere
done by a s.fran reviewer on another review site ,
but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his `` own '' review of the movie ; not of the movie at all .
anyone that watches this movie will realize
that it is great to recommend to family and friend ;
no car chase 
yea ! !
being `` in '' an italian family myself ,
i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen .
the movie has its tear jerking part as well .
it is what real life can be in such an environment .
nice movie .
