*warning* possible spoiler belowthe film is more boring then anything else .
there seems to be some attempt
to build tension through badly lit shot of empty room and empty lawn ,
but none of it works.mst3k did a fairly good job with it ,
but on its own the movie is mostly tedious.funny moment :
when the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ash 
the wife becomes hysterical and woozy
while the husband
( who is trying to drive the wife crazy )
says in a deadpan voice
`` there is no skull there ,
there is no skull .
`` when the real ghost-skull have the husband caught in a pickle ,
as if trapped between first and second base .
