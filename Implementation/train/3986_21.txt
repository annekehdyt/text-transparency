sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry film
and one of the best trait of these film is that they do not really degrade in quality from one film to the next .
thus 
sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan .
this time harry attempt to solve a series of murder
while on vacation .
harry 's always on the job it seems .
clint eastwood play harry
as he play all his man of action 
slow 
deliberate ,
and without fear .
as the first of the dirty harry film
to be made in the 80 's ,
sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel
that characterizes the first three film .
this does not mean that
it is quality is any less .
bottom line :
brimming with intensity and action ,
sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series .
