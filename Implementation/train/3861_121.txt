if you have ever wanted to see a film
that stresses style over substance ,
this is for you .
to me 
son de mar is beautiful to see ,
but there is precious little substance ,
unless mawkish 
melodramatic ,
manipulative love yarn turn you on .
this may be one of those famous 'chick flick '
you have heard so much about .
we are about half-way through this film
before anything really happens :
ulise
( jordi molla )
goes out to sea
looking for tuna ,
and does not come back ,
leaving his wife martina
( leonor watling )
and son to fend for themselves .
then 
in a furious six minute of screen time 
they bury ulise ,
martina gets married again ,
and her son grows into mid-childhood .
this rapid transposition is jarring ,
to say the least 
and very sloppy :
after 40 minute of more or less hanging around ,
we are suddenly into a full-blown melodrama 
all in six minute .
i think
this is called wayward narrative pacing.five year later 
ulise
( as in the wandering superhero ulyss ;
get it ?
) 
returns to his 'penelope '
( watling )
only to find
she is married to sierra
( eduard fernandez ) ,
an inexplicably wealthy guy
( what does he do to earn all that dough ? )
who inexplicably keeps crocodile as pet .
when martina 
in great anger 
question ulise about his absence ,
he tells her
that he will take her to the island of sumatra someday
and she will understand
everything.and here is the thing :
he does not take her to the island of sumatra .
the reference just dies somewhere in the script .
he does not really explain
where he was
and why he ignored his wife and child for five year .
he does not acquit himself as an honourable guy ,
and the movie does not fill in the plot hole
that are staring at us for at least half of the film .
i can only assume
that director bigas luna wants us to fill in the story line with the mystical clue
( fish 
reptile 
the sea )
he offers through eathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue .
it just does not work .
the narrative 'arc ' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline.i
am
sure
jordi molla is a good actor ,
but i just could not buy his ulise as any kind of hero
( which is what the original ulyss was supposed to be ) .
with moist sensuality 
he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from virgil roughly 2,000 time and each and every time
it excites martina to explosive orgasm .
this guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriage .
i am
sure virgil would be impressed .
he did not get laid that often ,
as i understand it .
this poetic 'device ' figure prominently in the film ,
and i had no choice
but to assume
it was a gender reversal of ulyss ' famous 'siren song '
( i.e .
beautiful maiden singing seductively to far-off sailor ,
who were doomed
if they answered the 
well 
siren call ) .
if this is what bigas luna is up to ,
you can see the problem
-- he is offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch-and-grab attempt at high art .
once again ,
it just does not work 
at least in my eye.watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor ,
but she gives us a character here
who does not seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth .
it is beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy
who sport a for-rent sign on his face
( as in vacan not ) ,
oily 1960s-style hair
that looks more like seaweed ,
and one of those trendy 21st-century 'beard '
( you know ,
four day ' growth 
no more 
no less ) .
he is supposed to be a dreamy kind of guy
( i think ) ,
but those eye of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script .
but 
do not despair ,
this film is great to look at .
just do not try to connect the dot on the red herring
or think too much about what you are hearing in the way of dialogue .
you can do a lost of fast-forwarding on this film
( particularly in the first 40 minute )
and you really will not miss much .
