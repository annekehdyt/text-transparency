i 
like many person 
saw this film in the theatre
when it first came out in '97 .
it was a below average film at best 
defiantly not the `` masterpiece ''
that all these `` titanic '' fanboy like to make it out as .
first off 
dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter
which way you look at it .
person just like him because of his look .
his acting `` skill '' essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy line and trying to act sexy .
second 
the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot :
girl falls in love with guy ,
ship they are on sink ,
lot of crappy love scene thereafter .
anyone with an iq above 50 will realize
this is not ingenious in any way whatsoever .
nor is it original .
plus the director felt the need
to drag it out for 3+ hour .
i could compress it into a 1 hour block
without losing any of the plot .
in conclusion 
`` titanic '' is the most overrated movie to date .
why it got so much attention and money
is beyond me .
