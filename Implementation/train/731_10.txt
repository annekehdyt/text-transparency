i liked this film very much .
the story jumps back
and forth quite a bit
and is not easy to follow .
there is no resolution to the story whatsoever ,
and you are left to wonder what really happened .
since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this .
i especially like the `` dating '' scene between the boy and i was drawn into their life .
and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra point .
