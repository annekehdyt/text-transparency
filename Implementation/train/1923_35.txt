casting aside many of the favorable comment
that have obviously come from friend and/or relative
that pepper this and many other low budget independent listed on imdb 
one is lost
when it comes to using these review as an accurate gauge .
so eventually you have to go out and rent
the flick just to see for yourself .
one of the first thing
you must understand
are the catch phrases
that camouflage the reality of the movie .
in this case the term `` dark psychological thriller . ''
read :
`` hack writer/director who thinks
he is an auteur ,
who replaces plot 
story 
and action ,
with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul .
his great insight ?
festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc
when we become adult .
wow 
i bet freud would be really impressed !
too many would be film maker like kallio ,
who were raised on low budget horror flick of the last few decade ,
fail to dig their own fresh grave .
instead 
they fall into the pre-dug grave of the many other director
that came before them .
they are content with rehashing old and tired horror clich\u00e9s
that they borrowed from a dozen or more film .
the result is an unoriginal 
uninspired 
unbelievable waste of film stock .
