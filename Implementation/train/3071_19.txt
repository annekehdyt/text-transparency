this is an excellent movie .
the cast is a great mix of character
and the story is decent .
the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the body of dead ide
and taking them to his home .
once the body are at his home ,
he removes stuff
( i hate to use such a general term ,
but i forget what it was he removed )
and puts it into his wife to retain her youth .
then a reporter 
patricia hunter 
investigates the situation and begins to find answer
on why the ide were dying .
she takes a trip to the doctor house and the interesting thing
begin to take place .
definitely watch this oldie 
but goodie
if you can .
