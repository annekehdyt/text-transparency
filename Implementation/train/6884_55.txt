at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state
that jon bon jovi delivers a firm 
strong 
seamless performance as derek bliss .
his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim
garnered in other film
( the leading man 
no looking back ) .
but 
in case anyone is still wondering 
yes ,
jon bon jovi can act .
he can act well
and that is come to be expected of him .
it is easy to separate derek from the guy
who belts out hit on vh-1.i
generally
would not watch a horror movie .
i have come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot .
what pleased me most about this film was
that there really was a viable plot
being moved along .
the gore is not so much
as to become the focus of the film
and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of film with higher technical effect budget .
so 
gore fan might be disappointed ,
but story fan will not.unlike an action film like u-571
where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast ,
we get a chance
to know `` the good guy ''
and actually care what happens to them .
a few scene are left unexplained
( like derek 's hallucination )
but you get the feeling certain aspect were
as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel .
unfortunately 
with the lack of interest
shown by hollywood in this film ,
that sequel will never happen .
these few instance are forgiveable
knowing
that vampire could have been a continuing series.is this the best film i
have ever seen in my life ?
no .
is it a good way
to spend about two hour
being entertained ?
yes .
it will not leave the person
who fears horror movie with insomnia
and it will not leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either .
if you are somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover ,
this film is for you .
it reaches a happy medium with the effect and story balancing each other .
