this movie is an insult to all submariner .
it was stupid .
it appeared to have been written by monkey .
the acting was absurd .
if this is the view most person have of the navy 
then i weep for our defense .
this movie was awful .
i put it below `` voyage to the bottom of the sea '' as far as submarine movie go .
gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap .
denzel washington must have been high .
little in the plot makes any sense .
and the ending .
for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime ?
only hollywood would think of this garbage .
if you have not figured it out yet ,
i did not like it .
and if it was not for all the pro comment ,
i would not have bothered to post .
