this is a modest ,
character driven comedy 
filmed in brazil on a low budget .
the premise is familiar 
the same as in the 1950 's danny kaye movie **on the double** :
someone
who 
as a joke ,
does an impression of a famous person
then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real.the contrast between the two lead is highly effective .
raul julia as the german-paradorian secret policeman 
is tall 
cool 
menacing and latin .
he sport a deliberately obvious blond dye job .
richard dreyfus 
animated 
short 
new york jewish 
is funny and sympathetic .
there are many reference
and inside joke about show business.the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay .
paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifty to the late eighty by gen. alfredo stroessner 
an unelected military dictator
whose father had emigrated from germany .
but writer/director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local condition
when he paints parador/paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny 
with huge disparity in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency .
further in this vein 
mazursky cast comic jonathan winter as an american retiree
who in truth
is c.i.a .
station chief in parador and a figure so powerful
that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out .
in fact the u.s. has little influence in paraguay ,
which is largely without the social and racial tension seen elsewhere in the region .
this is due to the country 's having fought long and costly war against much larger neighbor in the 19th and 20th century .
the male population was nearly wiped out both time but the society
that emerged was patriotic 
racially homogeneous and strongly united .
on yet another level 
there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna .
played by brazilian actress sonia braga ,
madonna is a former nightclub dancer
who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film 's start
but is seen on television
as president herself at the end
-- now politically and cosmetically correct 
no makeup 
hair demurely pulled back ,
swept to office by a velvet revolution.the one time
that such an event actually happened in latin america 
the administration of argentina 's isabel peron
( not the beloved evita ,
who never held office )
lasted two year after the death of her husband 
legendary **supremo** juan peron .
