i would of given this film a zero out of ten ,
but i will give it a two .
reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film ,
which is not really a reason .
last point is that rani appears in this film
and does a smooch with kamal .
i love rani very much and have a respect
that she is a great actress .
which is why i did not enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal 
but its no big deal .
anyway enough of the bedroom scenes
that made this film noticeable ,
lets actually talk about this film .
is it good or bad ,
i think its a completely rubbish movie
that made me yawn .
me being a fantastic critic ,
you can see my other 250+ review 's by clicking on my name ,
i have great taste .
the movie is not entertaining is one thing
and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema ,
why is there no morale in this movie .
its a biased movie that not a true story
and it stinks .
watching kamal kissing these actress makes me sick ,
man can not kiss properly anyway .
