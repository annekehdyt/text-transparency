guinea pig :
the devil 's experiment is without a doubt ***** star on first view 
its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature .
this movie gets right to the point ,
you may be thinking what point ?
the point is to satisfy fan 's of just extreme violence and gore .
this movie has some gore 
more or less just torturing a woman violently .
there are really only 3 scene 's that could be considered gore .
i will tell you one thing though guinea pig :
the devil 's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street .
if you thought
hostile was a crazy utal disturbing torture flick
then you are not seen the half of it
