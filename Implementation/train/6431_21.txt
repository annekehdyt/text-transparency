this episode apparently grew out of the cold war .
there has been a holocaust
but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charle bronson have come through unscathed .
it then becomes a battle for turf .
she is attracted to him and vice versa ,
but the instinct for survival takes over .
it is a quiet 
slow moving 
chess battle
as they attempt to achieve trust .
they come to truce but distrust takes over
and they start again .
of course 
the male female role of the sixty comes into play and modern viewer might find
that her need
to follow him
is a bit offensive .
but it still is captivating and interesting .
because she does not speak ,
we do not know here mind very well ,
but in the end we can guess .
