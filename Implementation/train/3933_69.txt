i saw this not too long ago ,
and i must say :
this movie is terrible .
i watch crappy movie for fun .
scarecreow is not fun .
scarecrow is stupid .
you have an incredibly corny villain
that enjoys screaming awful pun
as he kills his victim
( actually worse than the one
contained in this sentence ) .
he has his hard luck story
that he uses to justify his killing .
`` everyone picks on me .
the only girl
that thinks
i am not trailer-trash like one of the guy
that pick on me .
i want to kill everybody .
wah . ''
ok 
i am exaggerating .
but the premise to this movie alone is enough
to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movie.adding to what i just said ,
the kid 's mom is promiscuous ,
he walks in on his mother
and her current boyfriend getting it on ,
mom 's boyfriend tells him to leave 
kid refuse ,
insisting
that he is not going to leave his own house .
boyfriend chases kid into corn field .
he kills kid right in front of mom ,
mom scream in terror ,
boyfriend is like 
`` omg !
i did not mean to ! ''
then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it .
kid was killed under a scarecrow 
though .
so 
like any kid
who gets murdered under a scarecrow ,
he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance .
his victim `` have not been stalked like this before ... ''
( scarecrow 's official tag line )
to make matter worse ,
this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 day .
that is right 
8 day .
i was going to give this movie a 2 ,
because in spite of itself ,
it has one or two redeeming moment .
( they are spoiler ,
so i will not spoil it for you ,
if you actually want to see this crap . )
i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting 
the horrible special effect 
the abysmal script 
and the bad camera work ,
but i simply have no respect for lack of effort
on that level.this movie is not nearly as good
as i am
making it out to be .
if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie ,
or if you enjoy watching bad movie ,
like i do ,
then watch this at your own risk .
everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all time .
