can only be described as awful .
it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad .
when you start you really have to watch it through
because it is impossible to believe
that it can get worse - but fear
not because it does .
another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie star .
it is hard to decide
if the script is worse than the acting
or whether
the directing is worse than both .
as for the hero - well he belts up everyone
including one scene
where he beats the living daylight out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door
and smashing him against the window with it .
and in another scene he gets thrown through a window
and crash 20ft onto concrete - does not even blink - then gets up immediately
and gets stuck into the baddy .
this is a really ridiculous movie .
lucky it only cost me $ 1 to hire .
