i initially bought this dvd
because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought 
hey !
another film starring aishu and shah rukh 
little did i know
that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song
which she share with srk
and helps introduce his character
who is in the film for about just 15 minute .
shakti is a film about a mother 's love and endurance .
it is a film about transformation 
ignorance 
coming of age ,
stepping into the know
and emacing the harsh reality of life .
the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie .
it is actually a dream sequence
that occurs
while srk 's drunken character
is knocked unconscious by booze .
he dreams
that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl
who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day ,
dressed scan notily and begins to seduce him .
the title of the song is 'ishq kamina '
( loosely translated as `` love 's a bitch ! '' )
and it is just plain smoking hot !
do not miss it .
