this movie displays the kind of ensemble work
one wishes for in every film .
barbara bain and donald sutherland
( who play husband and wife )
are positive chilling ,
discussing the `` family business ''
as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaner .
macy 
campbell 
ullman 
and ritter are also terrific .
they play off each other like member of a top-notch theatrical troupe ,
who realize
that a quality product requires each actor to support the other unselfishly .
and finally 
there is sammy
( david dorfman ) .
what an amazing performance from a child ...
and what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman ,
whose son he plays !
we are treated to a unique story in `` panic 
''
and that is a rarity in these day of tired formulaic crap .
the dialogue is sharp and smart ,
and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power
to elicit a full range of emotion from the viewer .
there are place to laugh ,
to be shocked ,
to be horrified ,
to be saddened ,
to be aroused ,
to be angry 
and to love .
it is not a movie
that leaves you jumping for joy ,
but
when it is over you are more than satisfied knowing
you have spent the last ninety minute
experiencing a darn good piece of work.more of us would go to theatre
if we were treated to quality fare like this .
when are the power
that be in hollywood going to wake up ?
it is a real shame
when something this good fail to get exposure beyond festival and household fortunate enough to have cable .
