yes 
it is another great magical muppet 's movie and i adore them all ;
the character 
the movie 
the tv show episodes
( it is the best comedy or musical tv show ever )
and all the artist behind it .
but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i am surely talking about the weird ending ! !
i think
it is very dangerous to involve that much 
in american drama 
and end a love affair by marriage ! !
we 
as all the poor viewer ,
feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance 
peevishness and misery !
so we all enjoy these story
which gather 2 cute hero as couple in love
without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie 
superman and lois lane 
dick tracy and tess 
etc .
so with all of the previous couple and their like i bet
that you feel safe 
serenity and peace .
therefore when you look at what the maker of this movie had already done
you will be as mad as me !
they made the weak miserable creature
( kermit )
marry his daily nightmare 
the most vexatious female ever
( miss piggy ) !
this is a historical change by the measure of the american entertainment 's industry !
and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience
whom just refused to bless or believe
or being satisfied with that sudden marriage
( even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the proper opportunity
to think
or to decide anything ! ) .
therefore no wonder at all
when you know
that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious 
grossing only 25 million vis-\u00e0-vis 65 million
earned by the first one
( the muppet movie \u0096 1979 )
five year earlier !
! simply in this movie
they took manhattan ,
and my rest too !
