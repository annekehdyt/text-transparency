some of the poster seem less than gruntled
because this is neither mark twain nor rodger and hart but clearly
it does not pretend to be either .
you will look a long time
to find a greater rodger and hart fan than me
but burke and van heusen were not exactly chopped liver
in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great song -
but beautiful 
moonlight become you ,
it is always you 
the day after forever 
etc - to fit his highly personal style and here
they come up with yet another fine -
and unfairly neglected - ballad 
once and for always 
plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entry
in if you stub your toe on the moon
and busy doing nothing .
the flimsy plot is not meant to be taken seriously -
why else make merlin a heavy when in most 
if not all 
of the other version he is more a friend/mentor to arthur -
so
if you start wondering aloud
why sir lancelot
who has been sold to historian as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphose into a schoolyard bully you
are not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie .
on balance it does what it sets out to do 
entertain ,
so good luck to it .
