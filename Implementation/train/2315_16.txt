i really enjoyed the reunion a lot !
i would have rated it a 10 if
they had had `` hassie '' and `` little luke '' .
there was not even a mention of where
they are today or why
they did not participate in the reunion .
they were very popular character
and i think
it was a mistake
not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.anyway ,
i was glad
that tnn ran the series again !
i had been looking for episode for year
and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series
( i may have missed a few episode ) .
