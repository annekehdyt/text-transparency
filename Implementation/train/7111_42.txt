ben a out-of-town cop is convinced
his sister was utally killed
and wants to ing her killer to justice ,
but he is approached by stefan
who believes
his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult .
so ben 
his sister 's best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil.this
is incredibly awful b-grade stuff and i wondered
how it even got released .
it makes the original 'howling ' look like a masterpiece .
what was christopher lee thinking ,
as this has to be his worst performance i have seen.there was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film ,
ranging from the really hammy and wooden performance from annie mcenroe 
reb brown 
marsha a. hunt and sybil danning
( not to forgot lee ) ,
cheesy fashion
( those sunny ) ,
cheap and lame special effect 
bad use of lighting 
the humour ...
if there was any 
trashy 80s music
( with some of the film
just focusing on some unknown band
playing ) ,
werewolf 's having orgy
which is a sight
to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue .
i thought
if it was that bad it would be awfully funny ,
but i was wrong .
the positive were the location
and setting of the film looked great ,
but that is about it ...
actually i will add sybil danning short stripping scene
too.during the end credits
the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scene from the film ,
which i beckon the question why ?
an awful piece of mess ,
however at least it is not boring.1/5
