the event of the 11th of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all
singing all dancing comedy extravaganza
that we`d come to expect of this award show
but this was by no means a bad thing .
entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson
and that was it .
the rest of the show was taken up with clip from the nomination and i have to admit
this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance number we`ve
seen over the year and whoopi goldberg
was by no means a bad presenter
unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few year ago and the one minute silence for the victim of 9/11 was haunting
and dignified as for the award new zealand was absolutely robbed .
fellowship of the ring went home with four minor award
while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prize except for best actor
which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander
but went to an an all american nice guy instead .
the only oscar award i agreed with apart from the one
presented to fellowship
were the award for best supporting actress and best supporting actor 
both correct call .
