i am really surprised
this movie did not get a higher rating on imdb .
it is one of those movie
that could easily get by someone ,
but for romantic comedy `` moonstruck '' is really in a class by itself .
it is setting and ethnic charm are thing person seem to take for granted .
the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie .
few movie in the 1980 's were as good as `` moonstruck ''
and it is funny too .
**** out of *****
