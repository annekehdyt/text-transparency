to compare this squalor with an old ,
low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old 
low budget porno flick .
the animal scene have no meaning
nor do they represent this man and his crime even in the oadest sense of abstraction .
the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part 
`` gripping retelling of the btk killer 's reign of terror . ''
this is not a retelling .
a retelling would suggest
that you are being told the truth of what happened
or how or why .
none of these thing are true .
i am an enthusiastic studier of serial killer
and have seen some pretty crappy movie about them and honestly ,
this is not one of them .
this is not even about the btk killer .
save yourself some time and a few buck and rent dahmer instead .
that serial killer movie is accurate and true .
however ,
if you just have to see this movie for yourself ,
check it out for free at your local liary and even then ,
you will still feel cheated .
