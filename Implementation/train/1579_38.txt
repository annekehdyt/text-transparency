criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of satan 's black wedding/criminally insane ,
and it is a good thing too ,
because
when i have seen a movie
and know
there is a sequel
( especially something
that is as obscure as this )
i am always curious .
i have now had my curiosity satisfied
and will never watch this again .
most of ci2 is nothing but `` flashback '' to ci 
and footage of ethel asleep 
recalling fond memory ,
i guess .
thank to proposition 13
she is released from napa state
( wonder
if she got to see the cramp play
while she was there ? )
and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady
that ethel promptly takes to calling `` granny '' .
this is all filmed with a video camera
so the picture and sound are rather pathetic ,
and it is even complete with a couple of `` roll '' .
of course ethel does her thing ,
which is to dispatch anyone between her and food 
especially the guy
that witnesses one of her act of mayhem and extorts her dessert .
also 
you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderer
having a big drawer full of sharp knife in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink .
guess
that is all a matter of misguided `` trust '' .
if you liked or disliked criminally insane ,
either way there is no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity .
one wonders why the maker of this even bothered .
2/10 .
