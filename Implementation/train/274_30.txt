back
when alec baldwin and kim basinger were a mercurial 
hot-tempered 
high-powered hollywood couple
they filmed this
( nearly )
scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 steve mcqueen-ali macgraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome .
it almost worked the first time
because mcqueen was such a vital presence on the screen
-- even stone silent and weary ,
you could sense his clock ticking 
his cagey magnetism .
baldwin is not in steve mcqueen 's league ,
but he has his charm
and is probably a more versatile actor
-- if so 
this is not a showcase for his attribute .
basinger does well
and certainly looks good ,
but jame wood is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role .
a sub-plot
involving another couple
taken hostage by baldwin 's ex-partner
was unbearable in the '72 film
and play even worse here .
as for the action scene 
they are pretty old hat ,
which causes one to wonder :
why even remake the original ?
