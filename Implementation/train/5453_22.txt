( review in english ,
since swedish is not allowed )
i saw this movie with extremely low expectation ,
and i can sadly inform you
that the movie barely lived up to them.as much
as i loved to see janne `` loffe '' karlsson on the big screen again ,
the writer should have realized early in the scriptwriting process
that seven person falling into the water ,
is not original or funny .
the story is very thin
and the joke are used and predictable 
the one
that are not ,
is just plain boring .
i smiled like three time during the entire film.the placement of swedish findus product is
( unintentionally )
funny ,
why not just a big sign saying ;
`` findus made it happen !
`` .g\u00f6ta kanal 2 does not need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd ,
just wait for it to air on tv ,
it wont take too long .
