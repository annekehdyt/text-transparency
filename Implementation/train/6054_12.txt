this film was a waste of time ,
even rented on dvd .
if super-speedy camera shot get any faster than this ,
we might as well pay twenty buck to get in the laundromat 
get popcorn 
and watch the dryer spin .
jet li is so much better than this .
one can only hope
that he will not be making deal anytime soon
to make another cliche-ridden film like the one.if there is one film
you should avoid ,
this is `` the one '' .
