i know
that in this episode there is other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss ,
and in fact i think
it has some virtue ;
for example 
the fact 
after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing sun 's flashback in `` house of the rising sun '' ,
we get to see jin 's side of thing
and get a new ,
more balanced understanding of his life.but there is an element in this story
that made me so deeply uncomfortable
that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode .
before now 
in the scene
where jin appeared with blood on his hand and shirt ,
it had been hinted
that sun 's father was someone
who was getting rich through shady 
illegal method .
i thought
maybe he was a mob boss 
even ;
mobs operate in korea 
just like in almost every other country in the world ,
so it was a reasonable possibility .
however 
in this episode we learn
that sun 's father is in fact the boss
( or a top executive )
of a korean automotive company ,
and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official
( who was actually going to be murdered )
on his behalf.i may be especially touchy about this
because i happen to work in the automotive industry ,
but i would say
it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest
that this kind of thing goes on in korea ;
that huge 
serious company like hyundai or kia
( which must be the model for this fictitious car company ,
as they are the only one
that actually exist in reality )
operate with these mafia-like method ,
instead of like any normal automotive company of the west .
it is just unbelievable to me that the writer would have the gall to write something like that into the story ,
and that there has not been an uproar in korea over it .
it feels like extraneous `` buy american ! ''
propaganda 
portraying foreign car company as criminal 
untrustworthy 
third-world outfit .
