movie about dinosaur can be entertaining .
so can whoopi goldberg movie .
but whoopi and dinosaur ? after the first 20 minute of `` theodore rex '' 
i had come to one conclusion :
this movie is evil .
evil 
vile 
wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience .
nothing this bad is made by accident ;
this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.first of all ,
whoopi does not make good action movie
( watch `` fatal beauty ''
if you think
i am lying ) ,
but the film maker do not care -
she is a tough cop here 
yet again .
seen a million cop buddy flick this week ?
well 
here is number one million and one 
pal.do not like cute 
humanistic animated dinosaur
since that spielberg tv show about them ?
too bad 
here is another one
and he is a cop ,
too ! you one of those person
that hates car chase 
shoot-out 
sloppy dialogue 
boring futuristic fx and seeing talented person
( goldberg 
mueller-stahl 
roundtree )
stuck in a movie
that looks like a tax write-off ?
a big tax write-off ?
and you read this review all the way to the end .
you deserve a sequel .
seriously.no star 
not a one .
and if they really make a sequel to `` theodore rex '' ,
hollywood deserve to be attacked a whole herd of wise-cracking foam rubber dinosaur.now ,
i would pay to see that .
