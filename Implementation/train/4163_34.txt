roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion .
i can not imagine
there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire ,
yet both part of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most person ,
myself included.polanski is very good
at making us feels the inner torture of his character
( deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire ) ,
starting with some lack of self-assurance soon
to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness
eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise .
the shared ordeal for the character and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movie
since there is no tangible supernatural element here .
while horror movie allow for some kind of catharsis
( be it cheap or more elaborate )
polanski sadistically tortures us and ,
if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent ,
we are mostly on our nerve as opposed to on the edge of our seats.suspense 
horror ,
all this is a matter
of playing with the audience 's expectation
( alternatively fooling and fulfilling them ) ,
not literally with person 's nerve .
in my book rosemary 's baby is a far greater achievement
because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle :
the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat ,
while we are forced to identify with a sole character .
what is more if the fantasy element are all in the hero 's mind
the situation is most uncomfortable since we ,
the viewer 
are compelled to judge him ,
reject him
while we have been masterfully lured
( `` paint 'n lure '' )
into being him .
