a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse
when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel .
altman creates a suspenseful 
gothic atmosphere
but the script is weak .
sporting a southern drawl 
branagh is convincing as the lawyer ,
and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire .
downey is likable as a private detective .
duvall has a small role ,
which does not allow him to do much with his weird character .
hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast .
after an interesting setup 
the film bog down and does not really deliver on its initial promise ,
but altman is always worth a look .
