had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast ,
some really hard working person in the industry ,
and
when i finally watched i was not disappointed.this movie has some altman-like flavor
( he is mentioned in the end credits as a `` thank '' person )
utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot line
that intertwine as the film draws to its climax .
macy is pure 
clean 
and honest as a man
who can not seem to escape his `` destiny '' ,
sutherland play and portray as few can ,
neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment 
add tracy ullman 
barbara bain
( remember mission impossible on tv ?
) ,
not to mention the steady john ritter
and you have all the ingredient for a good film .
the script is uncluttered ,
the dialog is free from clich\u00e9 and thoughtful
( especially between macy and david dorfman ) .
suspend belief and enjoy ,
this is truly time well spent .
