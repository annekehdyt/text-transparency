pushing daisy was a wonderful show .
much like dead like me and wonderfall 
you can tell was created by bryan fuller .
i can understand
how person
who do not have much of a love for theater 
cinema 
musical and the like would be annoyed .
this is not a typical television program
and the fantastic is too much for some .
these person seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone
to keep them happy .
this program explodes with color 
wink at old movie scene 
hum with incredible music and talented performance .
there is nothing random about the choice
that are made from costume to leitmotif .
the story takes many twist and turn but all very accessible
because the conversation are about love 
honesty 
courage 
loss and so many other thing
we face every day .
the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show
and that was rushed
because pushing daisy was canceled .
do not approach this as a typical tv show .
think of it as an evening at the theater ,
then sit back and enjoy !
