a low budget effort from texas
that is at least filmed well ,
but that is little consolation .
bad acting 
or ,
should i say 
bad over-acting 
a pretty limp story line
that is nothing new 
bad special effect 
bad 
bad 
bad .
seems like a bunch of young folk are putting together a haunted house for halloween ,
which is done every year ,
but this year thing are different .
has a long extended lesbian theme
that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spot ,
of which there are a lot .
putrid 
puerile 
definitely avoidable 
at all cost .
