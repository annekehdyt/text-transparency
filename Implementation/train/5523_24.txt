this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence
which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective ,
so i was hooked by the time
the title came on .
the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting ,
trying to re-invent themselves ,
but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspect 
but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life
we find ourselves in a little more interesting .
the scene in the chicken warehouse are spectacular .
at one point jorgen
( who owns the chicken farm )
attends a seminar in laughing ,
where he is the worst student .
his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself .
the movie made me wonder about the hidden mystery
that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace person i see every day .
there is not a lot of plot here .
guessing the old man 's secret is pretty easy ,
but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other character will do
when they figure it out .
this movie appealed to me in the same way
that sideways did ,
although the character could not be more dissimilar .
