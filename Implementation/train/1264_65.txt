the concept of this made-for-tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond word 
but hey ,
it was the late 1970 's
and literally all stupid horror format were pretty damn profitable ,
so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog ?
the plot of `` devil dog '' is easy to describe to fan of the horror genre :
simply think of `` the oman ''
and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups !
seriously 
i am not kidding ,
that is what the movie is about !
during the opening sequence 
member of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat
only to have it impregnated by satan himself .
you would think
that the lord of darkness has other thing on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard
and take over the world one evil puppy at the time 
but apparently not .
exactly like little damien in `` the oman '' ,
one of the puppy is taken in by model family
and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal .
but lucky \u0096
that is the dog 's name \u0096
is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbor and nosy school teacher in derivative and tamely executed way .
he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and child ,
but he can not force the father
( richard crenna )
to stick his arm into a lawnmower
because he is a `` chosen one '' .
the whole thing becomes too moronic for word
when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting
and gets advice from an old witchdoctor
who speaks perfect english .
i guess
he learned that
living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life .
director curtis harrington
( `` what is the matter with helen '' 
`` ruby '' )
and lead actor richard crenna
( `` wait until dark '' ,
`` the evil '' )
desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere ,
but all is in vain .
scene like cute puppy eye spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullet
without even moving evoke chuckle instead of fright ,
and not even spooky musical tune can chance that .
the `` special '' effect are pathetic 
especially near the end
when the satan-dog mutate into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall .
`` devil dog '' is a truly dumb movie ,
but it is definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friend and load of liquor .
there are entertaining ief cameos of martine beswick
( `` dr. jekyll and sister hyde '' )
as the terrifying cult queen and r.g .
armstrong
( `` the car '' ,
`` the pack '' )
as the evil fruit 
vegetable and puppy salesman .
and 
yes 
that annoying daughter is the same kid
who gets blown away
complaining about her ice-cream in carpenter 's `` assault on precinct 13 '' .
