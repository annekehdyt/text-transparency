all of the review here
about how much zp lacks plot ,
the acting is wooden ,
the orgy scene makes no sense 
etc. ,
all miss the main point.let 's be honest .
this is a movie
made in the heady time of late 1960 and early 1970s los angele .
it is a movie meant to be watched
while your are h-i-g-h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.find some kind bud and smoke up ,
or get a mild hit of acid .
seriously 
these straight and sober review of zp miss the point .
you can not get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.until
you have watched this movie on the big screen
( which i am lucky to have done three time in the 1990s
when zp was quite rare )
tripping out 
you have no idea
what this movie is all about.if
you insist on watching it not intoxicated ,
you can at least appreciate the ending
when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd 's wonderful re-working of `` careful with that axe 
eugene 
''
`` come in number 51 ,
your time is up . ''
