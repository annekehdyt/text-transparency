predictable parody ,
just about failed to impress throughout
it is looooooong eight minute .
the only thing
that made it worthwhile
was the do not colorize line at the end credit .
shame something more entertaining was not put on the dvd 
like jonathan ross ' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show . '
