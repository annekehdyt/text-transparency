i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom ' for absolutely age
and it was only recently
when i got the chance
to watch this adaption of it .
i have heard lot of positive remark about this ,
so i had high hope .
once this film had finished ,
i was horrified.this film is not a good film at all .
'goodnight mister tom ' was an extremely poor adaption
and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out .
particularly 
i found
that a lot of the character and some great scene in the book were not in this .
there was not much dialogue ,
it was rushed and far too fast-moving ,
but i was mostly upset by the fact
that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film
which was a true let down .
the casting was not all that good 
either .
i thought
this could have been really good ,
but it was so different to the book !
anextremely poor adaption 
one of the worst i have seen .
this deserves a decent remake
that 'd better be 1000 time better than this pile of garbage .
