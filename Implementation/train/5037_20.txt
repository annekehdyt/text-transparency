i missed almost all of the first season ,
but
when the other show went to reruns ,
i started watching .
i ended up buying the entire first season off itune .
this is now one of my favorite comedy show .
patrick warburton is the key .
his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time .
david spade is funny ,
but sometimes a little russell goes a long way .
i enjoy the other cast member more
( but not saying
he does not add to the show )
.do yourself a favor .
if you have not checked this one out ,
give it a try .
if you can catch the episode
where `` jeff '' goes to the sperm bank ,
you will see how good this show is.i hope
this series has a long run .
