this is probably one of the worst `` wan na be a low budget
hit film ''
to credit the dinosaur genre .
the film is so predictable
you could go away 
cook yourself dinner ,
go answer the phone or whatever
and when you are back you
will know
exactly what has happened .
the special effect are so poor
you would have thought
lego ick were used
and the `` super fast '' dinosaur were so tame
that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator .
the acting is over cooked .
they try so hard ,
yet there just is not enough character behind them
to get into the character and as for the scientist ... yeah okay we know
exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glass .
stereotypical was created for film like this .
if you want to watch this film ,
i suggest
you are not in as a serious mood
as the cast and crew obviously were .
and if you are really really into dinosaur
and know everything in the world about them ,
do not watch it ,
you might eak the screen -
the fact are that far off .
