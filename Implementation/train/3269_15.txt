this was an absolutely terrible movie .
do not be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside .
both are great actor ,
but this must simply be their worst role in history .
even their great acting could not redeem this movie 's ridiculous storyline .
this movie is an early ninety us propaganda piece .
the most pathetic scene were those
when the columbian rebel were making their case for revolution .
marium conchita alonso appeared phony ,
and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie
that was devoid of any real meaning .
i am disappointed
that there are movie like this ,
ruining actor 's like christopher walken 's good name .
i could barely sit through it .
