i simply never tire of watching freebird .
my husband was an extra
so i was involved from the start .
have kept in touch with jon
and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release .
even to the extent of distributing promotional postcard on cross channel ferry and various place throughout france .
freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moment plus choice casting .
only phil daniel could fit the role of grouch .
great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party
following the premier in january .
anything else
you want doing jon just ask 
either email or phone ,
you know how to get me .
