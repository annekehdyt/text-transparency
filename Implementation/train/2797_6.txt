a great storyline with a message .
joan plowright is superb as `` phoebe '' ,
mike kopsa is hilarious as `` coach '' and richard de klerk plays the role of `` carmine '' superbly .
mischa barton as `` frankie '' puts in a good performance and ingrid as `` hazel '' plays her first lead extremely well .
this film is superbly directed by jo-beth william .
the editing is first rate .
