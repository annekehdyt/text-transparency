a poorly written script with no likeable character .
as for it being a comedy ,
i forgot to laugh .
it is about 2 conceited friend
who scam to get woman in too bed with them
( no sex scene )
and another friend
( who is semi-discustingly weird )
who sometimes also scams
but mainly is considered as being the guy
who masterbates .
the 3 friend separately meet and fall for the same woman
( amanda peet ) .
somehow this is done
without really any romance .
the 3 guy stop being friend
as they separately dated her .
she scammed them out of their friendhip
because they scammed woman .
-- a bad movie
