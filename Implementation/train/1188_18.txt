chilly 
alienating adaptation of rebecca west 's book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired
( now there is an original idea ! ) .
it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie ,
which should be enough
to set off some emotional spark .
this extremely well-cast soaper ings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridge and co-star jackson 
christie 
ann-margret 
and ian holm ,
but the burner are all on low .
there are a handful of good scene
( particularly whenever jackson is on-screen ) ,
but bridge ' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish
and the film 's dulled-out color is enervating .
long on the shelf 
this `` soldier '' is best left forgotten .
*1/2 from ****
