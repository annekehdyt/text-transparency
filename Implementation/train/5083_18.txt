this is truly one from the `` golden age '' of hollywood ,
the kind
they do not make anymore .
it is an unique 
fun movie
that keeps
you guessing what is going to happen next .
all the actor are perfectly cast
and they are all great supporting actor .
this is the first movie i
saw with ronald colman in it
and i have been a fan of his ever since .
reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine
and adds a certain quality to every movie
he is in .
while he played a different kind of character here ,
he still added something to the movie
that another actor cast in this character would not have added .
