i was talked into watching this movie by a friend
who blubbered on about what a cute story this was.yuck.i want my two hour back ,
as i could have done so many more productive thing with my time ... like 
for instance 
twiddling my thumb .
i see nothing redeeming about this film at all 
save for the eye-candy aspect of it ... 3/10
( and that is being generous )
