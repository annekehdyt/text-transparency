for a science scare movie to work well
it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling .
this movie is neither .
sure there is a pseudo-original twist
in that the guy kills person
because of a toxin
and not because of a disease ,
but that is a very minor twist .
there is the government conspiracy angle ,
the crusader protagonist
who has personal experience ...
and one real drawback of this movie
is that the contaminated man has no pathos .
although the character is scripted to be someone
who should be pitied ,
he is not .
without the pity the movie is pointless .
the other character are so cookie cutter
they are ridiculous .
the subplot are convoluted and annoying .
and the saddest thing is the movie is too flat
to even be enjoyed as mock material .
make the movie a 45 minute short
and it might be worth watching .
