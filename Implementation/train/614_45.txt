spoiler ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
! i watched half of this movie
and i did not like it .
first reason :
boring .
barely anything happens ,
the woman sit around and discuss
how terrible their life are and how they have no hope ,
they smoke weed 
read magazine 
care for their sick friend ,
and cut up the occasional dead body .
boring ! ! !
! second reason :
there are too many thing left unexplained .
many scene are dedicated to a zombie hunter
who kidnaps random man ,
restrains them in a chair and interrogates them .
who are these man ?
how do they know anything about illegal activity
concerning the diseased flesh eater ?
why does he kill one and let another one go ?
also there is this dude
who at first i thought
also had the flesh eating disease
but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting
he is not quite what we originally thought-never explained !
how frustrating is that ?
conclusion :
i found the woman annoying 
the story uninteresting 
the duologue tedious 
and the action non-existent .
also the cover art is misleading
since it makes you believe
this movie is going to be cool
when it clearly is not .
i rented this movie
based on some of the review
made by other person on this website ,
and although i respect the fact
that some person might have enjoyed this flick ,
i will from now on make sure i read more than two review deep into a movie
so
as to avoid renting another movie i regret seeing .
