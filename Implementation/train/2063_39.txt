uc 0079 
the one year war is almost at an end .
a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclop 
a zeon task force .
their target 
a new gundam being built exclusively for newtype
( supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga )
inside .
when little boy al izuruha 
a fan of zeon ms 
encounters a zaku
after battle eaks out in the colony ,
he befriend newbie ms pilot benard `` bernie '' wiseman .
the two become good friend 
al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclop team .
through the show 
bernie act as a father figure to al
( whose real father is always working )
and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie ,
but eventually
they must meet ... .in battle .
al soon learns
that war is not child 's play and bernie
must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice
to complete his mission.for only 6 episode ,
gundam 0080 is a well done show .
the mobile suit are extremely well designed ,
and the animation may look dated
but really shows emotion in the character .
if you liked 0083 then check this one out ,
or if you are new to the gundam world ,
this is a good show
to start with .
if you look to a show for drama and character development ,
this is the one for you ,
it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle .
i would rate it more of a drama than action.mobile suit gundam 0080 
war in the pocket .
sometimes you have to lose to win .
