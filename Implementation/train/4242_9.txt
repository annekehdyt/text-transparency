this movie is really wack .
there is really nothing nice i can say about it ,
besides the moral truth expressed in the film 's climax concerning person in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime .
besides all that 
the film had nothing :
no good shot 
no good acting 
and no good script .
i give this film a f and a 2 out 10 .
