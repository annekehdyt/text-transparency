after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller 
madam lili
( 1969 )
starring julie andrew on tv this afternoon ,
i suddenly thought
i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller .
all i could remember was
that it was produced by dino de laurentis .
it only took a short search on imdb
to find fraulein doktor .
once i recognised the title
the memory came flooding back .
it is 
for its time 
a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true event such as the death of kitchener and the german offensive of 1918.it also has a female spy
who is much more believable than julie andrew !
as with other reviewer the first and strongest memory was of the well
produced battle scene and of man and horse in gas mask .
if you have an interest in war film and particularly ww1
it is a film well worth
seeing
if you have the opportunity .
