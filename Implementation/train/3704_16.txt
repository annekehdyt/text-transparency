and that comes from someone
that will withstand almost any viewing .
the acting and sound is awful .
this might qualify for a `` so bad
it is good '' point of merit 


for some .
however i take my horror movie seriously
and this is just crap-it is just soooo cheap ,
i think
that is my major complaint .
the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many time `` you startled me '' is used .
the `` child '' actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career
ended here..her line `` donut !
i hate donut '' is worth repeated viewing however .
