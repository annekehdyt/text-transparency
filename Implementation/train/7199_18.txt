i was supposed to review this for a website ,
and i watched this with optimism
that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off ,
and it did not even do that well enough .
`` 666 :
the child '' is probably one of the worst supernatural thriller i have ever seen
( even worse than `` godsend '' )
with scene
that rip from `` the oman ''
without shame .
the ending is even very similar to the way `` the oman '' end .
not to mention that the acting 
writing 
and story are all just hackneyed .
if these movie make money ,
i am sad to see
where asylum is headed .
it is embarrassing .
