out of the first five episode of hammer 's short-running `` hammer house of horror '' series 
this fifth episode with the wonderful title `` the house
that bled to death ''
is arguably the creepiest one .
as a great fan of the hammer studio ' gothic horror film for many year 
i wonder
what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently .
so far 
i have only seen the first five episode ,
and i have a strong feeling
that the best is yet to come ,
but even if the series stays as entertaining
as the first five episode are ,
i will be satisfied .
whereas the second and third episode were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor ,
this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five
that delivers the most genuine horror .
the episode begins
when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivation .
year later 
william
( nicholas ball )
and emma peter
( rachel davy )
move in the house with their little daughter sophie
( emma ridley ) .
soon
after moving in 
however ,
the family have to find out
that there is something terribly wrong with the house ,
which is seemingly haunted ...
the second episode
directed by francis megahy
is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry 
`` growing pain ''
( episode 4 ) ,
and the fairly unknown actor deliver good performance .
the film is also well-made in term of effect 
cinematography and score .
`` the house
that bled to death ''
is a solid episode
that delivers the element
that my fellow hammer-fan should like to see in a short horror tale .
the film delivers a creepy atmosphere 
genuine scare moment and intelligent twist ,
and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end .
overall 
this is highly recommendable to hammer fan .
