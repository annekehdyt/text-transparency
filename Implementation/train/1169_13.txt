perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia 's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the person in the crowd
that are not laughing .
if there is anybody
who 's insecure ,
it is a comedian
who will not shut up about his audience.then again ,
perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia 's comedy is that he does not get off his free speech high horse .
if you want to be funny ,
just make a joke ,
do not explain all the reason
why you are saving the american way with your failed attempt at generating laughter.hmm ...
actually ... the worst thing about carlos mencia 's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jab at ethnicity for legitimate humor .
avoid this like the plague .
