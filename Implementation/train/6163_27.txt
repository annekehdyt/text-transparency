the opening scene move as fluidly as frozen velveeta .
the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me
wish
i had better control of the fast forward control .
vampire are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creature .
this vampire tries to seduce his prey
by imitating a lost puppy .
i usually tally a body count ,
so there was a cat
( which does not count )
a bum 
a girl
who fell out of the sky with a sword in her
( whatever
that was about )
and then the plot .
foley artist are respected for using celery
to create the sound of a oken arm ,
but using the sound
of biting into an apple for a vampire
biting a victim
is just plain silly .
i liked warlock 
but this movie just stunk so bad
that we turned it off ,
and it was so forgettable
we rented it a year later only to turn it off again .
