i remember
watching `` gung ho '' as a child with my mother ,
and wondered why
she would always cry in the last few minute .
i 
of course 
found the entire movie hilarious 
particularly the mannerisms of the character .
it was not until i was much older
and watched it again
that i realized
how much deeper this show actually is.michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their role as the reluctant mediator .
keaton cease to amaze me with his real-life style of line delivery ,
and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix .
i also thought
that pattus yasutake
( umeki )
was simply fabulous in her role
as the comic relief.i think
this movie is one of the most underrated film of the 80s .
we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese worker in this film ...
sometimes you really *can* have `` the best of both world . ''
and now i understand
why my mother felt the way
she did in those closing moment .
i would rather have one of those car 
too .
