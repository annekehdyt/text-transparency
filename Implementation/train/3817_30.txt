at first glance 
this movie has got everything a psycho wants :
a vampire story with a `` not under 18 '' restriction ,
filled with hyper-violence 
drug 
gore 
sex
( including lesbian sex ) ,
some fanatic zealot and even a gay necrophiliac cop !
but then 
this movie is a succession of bad story
( so thin ) ,
bad acting -with a ridiculous english accent
making you believe
you are watching a bad monty python - ,
bad music
( '80s hard rock ) ,
the videotaping is awful ,
the ending is a real shame ...
plus the scene of sex are ridiculous 
the gore not very impressive .
and those vampire reflect in a mirror ,
and do not even fear daylight !
you get to be very disappointed ,
unless you see it as a `` space mutiny '' or `` troll 2 '' .
i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 ,
because
that is its real place.i would say
it can still be fun to watch ,
if you have friend and enough beer.3/10
