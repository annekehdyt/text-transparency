yeti deserves the 8 star rating
because it is the one of the greatest bad movie
ever made .
i saw it at a midnight screening in l.a. and person were roaring
and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwreck
where you think
it can not get any stranger
and then it does !
the millionaire
who fund the project
to thaw the yeti look like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit
- the guy
playing the scientist
is one of the worst actor to ever appear on screen - and yes ,
there is a mute boy
( who sorta kinda look like a girl )
and he is mute ever
since he survived a plane crash
that killed both his parent
( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ? ? ) .
then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti
( once he thaws -
which takes forever )
-- and he is instantly in love with her -
what is one of the most hysterical thing about the movie
is that this giant yeti makes `` bedroom eye '' at her -
it is like a large barry white
trying to seduce a groupie .
in fact 
once the large yeti picks up the hottie
and has her against his chest -
she accidentally touches the yeti 's nipple and yes ,
the film takes the time
to show his large grey nipple get hard ! ! ! !
yike of all yike !
plus there is a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard
that american audience like dog
and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie -
there is also this insane scene
where the yeti eats a giant fish -
keeps the large fishbone
and uses it to comb the italian girl 's hair `` gee 
thank yeti -
now my hair is smooth and smell like dead trout .
you are the best . ''
this film is more bizarre than something
ed wood could have ever dreamt up .
if you are a fan of classic cinema crap -
seek this baby out .
