who likes awful `` comedy '' show like little mosque on the prairie ?
the only two kind of person i can think
of who watch this are :
one 
muslim and self-proclaimed liberal defender of every ethnic group
who are so thrilled there
is a show about muslim
that it does not even matter
if the show is good or funny at all
( which it is not ) .
two 
old person and person
whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable ,
badly written ,
stale joke.cbc need to really take a look
at what they are doing
and who their audience is .
if they keep only writing comedy for really old person
then guess what will happen ,
their audience will die off soon
and they will have no audience left .
i would be curious who even writes for this show ?
do you think
it is actually muslim 
or hip 
funny young person ?
no 
i bet
it is old white guy
who have been writing the same joke for the same kind of bad cbc show
since the 1960's.when you look at the cbc comedy show
there are ,
air farce was only finally just taken off the air
( thank goodness ! )
but we still have lame duck like this hour has 22 minute and rick mercer
that we are paying for ,
not to mention this poor excuse for `` comedy '' little mosque on the prairie .
it is supposed to be offencive and funny ?
only the cbc would think
this lame show is at all offencive or funny .
shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollar on show
only a few person
would bother watching .
