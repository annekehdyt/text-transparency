the british claymation series putting `` witty '' conversation taped from `` average '' person in the mouth of `` cute '' fanciful creature at least had the advantage for non-british viewer of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor
you could not get on u.s. television .
someone made the mistake
of putting it on u.s. television.sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit-com coupling
which died in a month on nbc
when the same basic script did not `` translate '' from british english to american english ,
what seemed droll and cultured
( and just a bit dull )
in england 
comes across in creature comfort 
the american version 
as simply boredom with puppet .
there is no through plot-line 
no character and after one and a half episodes watched
( of the three ultimately aired ) ,
no reason to suffer through more.the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully ief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done
and coming as a set-up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule 
the new adventure of old christine
( or `` how to be a horrible mother - or person - in one interminable 
unfunny lesson '' ) 
kid
who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show ,
and the adult could wait to tune in until 9pm
when `` two and a half man ''
( guilty pleasure )
and `` how i met your mother ''
( actual quality writing )
come on .
