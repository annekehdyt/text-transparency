the truth is that a film
based on a harold robbin novel
is not going to win any award .
this is no exception .
`` the lonely lady '' is a pure b picture in budget 
cast and execution .
technically 
it looks like a made-for-tv film .
the acting is very uneven .
joseph cali is especially terrible .
anthony holland is an embarrassment .
as one reviewer said of a certain katherine hepburn performance ,
her range goes from a to b. ms zedora manage
to get to g. the rest of the cast is solid
( and wasted in their respective role ) .
lloyd bochner and bibi besch deserved better .
still 
the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way .
as befit robbin 
everything revolf around sex and nudity .
if you are looking for some fun ...
and you are not too sober ...
this could be for you .
