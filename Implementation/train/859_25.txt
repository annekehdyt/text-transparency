karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island .
they capture a trio of guy
who stumble upon the island .
whom after a while fight back .
( well the survivor )
this one has non-stop blood 
gore and carnage ,
which would have been good
if any of it looked remotely real ,
or if the production did not look like
it was made with a week worth
of saved up lunch money
( i may be overexxagerating there .
it was probably just a couple day worth ) .
the horrendous dubbing did not bother me as much and i suspect
if i had been really drunk ,
some of it might have been slightly humorous ... .maybe .
but as it is ,
at merely 78 minute the movie still felt way too long by.. oh i do not know ... 78 minute .
do not waste your time.my grade :
f dvd extra :
bonus movie :
`` zombie '90 :
extreme pestilence '' ;
and trailer for other shock-o-rama released film
