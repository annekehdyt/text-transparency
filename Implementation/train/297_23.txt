first of all 
i liked very much the central idea
of locating the '' intruder '' 
other in the fragile self 
on various level - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical .
in fact the intruder are omnipresent throughout the film :
in the swiss-french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life ;
in the his recurring daydream and nightmare ;
inside his ailing body after heart transplantation ... .
in the last half of the film 
he becomes intruder himself ,
returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past .
the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic 
full of regret and guilt 
sense of failure
being more or less dominant .
this is a quite grim picture of an old age ,
ostensibly self-dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside .
the directer composes the image more to convey passing sensation of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning .
some of them are mesmerizing ,
not devoid of humor though 
kind of absurdist play
only somnambulist can visualize .
