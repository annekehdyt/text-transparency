andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman
whose late start at a serious relationship
leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man 
the `` girl-friends '' 
dead-set on terminating this `` silly relationship '' 
go over and beyond the call of duty in `` helping out '' their friend
( who obviously is blinded by this gigolo 's tricky game ''
.a short succession of situation is absolutely ridiculous .
far fetched no longer covers it .
without these unbelievable scene ,
there may have been hope for a sweet love story .
instead 
all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head
-- these thing just do not happen !
without giving away cliff-hanger detail ,
i warn the viewer of having high expectation for this film ;
most ( like me ) will be very disappointed .
on a scale of 1 to 10 
this one ranks a weak 4 with me .
there is much better material out there .
this one is not worth your time .
