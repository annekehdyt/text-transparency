i remember
devil dog
playing on tbs
almost 20 year ago ,
and my older sister and her friend watching it and laughing all the next day .
it is not that bad for a made-for-tv horror movie ,
but it is derivative
( mostly of the exorcist )
and businesslike 
for lack of a better word .
it will not blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting ,
but it is not a waste of time 
either .
it is the kind of movie
you watch
to kill a couple of hour
when you are not in the mood
to think too hard.however ,
if you go into the movie
looking for some laugh ,
you will not be disappointed .
the early scene 
with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with child of the damned eye are hilariously non-threatening ,
and the climactic blue-screen effect of a giant black dog
( with horn ! )
are pretty side-splitting .
and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shade toward the beginning.not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination ,
but i wish
they still made stuff like this for tv .
