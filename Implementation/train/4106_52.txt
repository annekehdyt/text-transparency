gave this movie a 10 and those
who do not are being too critical or maybe expected something else .
this is one of my favorite movie from the 80 's ,
it grows on you ,
and has it all .
i just got it on dvd and 20 year
later it still does not disappoint ,
having plenty of action 
drama 
romance 
and even comedy .
add to that the great car chase 
automatic weapon shootout and lot of stuff blowing up
and you have a fun ,
edge of your seat experience !
you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for day
after seeing this .
you can watch this movie with your wife/gf
and you will both enjoy it lot .
the premise is that of a paperback book hero 
like doc .
savage 
really existing and helping person fight evil
so he can write
the story is almost true to life here .
the actor jake speed is also a director 
producer and writer of many film .
in this film jake speed
( the character )
is an indiana jone adventurer type ,
he usually uses his head
to get out of sticky situation
but will sometimes resorts to ute firepower
( yay ! ,
and sheer dumb luck too ! ) .
keep an eye out for his one `` james bond '' hi-tech equipmant 
the ultimate road warrior suv
dropping out of the sky.the heroine
is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie `` once bitten ''
and here she is a little older
and still a knockout
even compared to her teenage blonde little sister.the bad guy are `` real bad '' man
and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate .
the ending is just perfect
and can stand alone or invite a sequel ,
sadly never made -
but you can just imagine what would happen next ! you have to see this movie
just because it will entertain
and amuse you
and that is worth the price of a ticket .
