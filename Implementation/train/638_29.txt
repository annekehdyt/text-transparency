this was a painful example of a cheap 
boring and unoriginal show
produced by australian tv station
to fulfil local content quota .
the writing was truly terrible
and i am not surprised
that the writer are those
responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory
the honerable wally norman.nothing about this tv series was funny - ever -
not even mildly amusing .
it was just tired and bad and 
worst of all ,
it really thought
it was funny .
it was simply embarrassing to watch.there is something very suss about this show
being given 10/10 on imdb .
try to find a
( real )
review by a ( real )
australian viewer of the show
( there were not many )
and it is impossible .
or crazy .
there are loafs of ead
that are funnier than this show .
avoid the show at all cost
and if it does come out on dvd ,
remember that the laughter
that deserves was unintentional .
