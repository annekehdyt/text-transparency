the color purple is about the struggle of life and the love
that helps those person strongly affected by the struggle of life .
every character had an element of the color purple in them .
the movie touch on love 
lost 
hope 
hate 
and triumph .
whether it be celie having lived through hell
and losing her sister ,
and shug coming into her life
to show her love again ,
albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie 
shug shunned by her father and confess to him in the end 
sofia and her stubborness good and bad 
and even nettie 
they had their emptiness and hardship through the film
but was overcome in the end
and that is the sign of a good movie .
good job to all the cast and crew .
