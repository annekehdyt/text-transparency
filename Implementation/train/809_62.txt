carol 's journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reason .
the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young ,
and she is one of those special actor
who can say say much with facial expression .
director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no eak in continuity ,
thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense
to keep one wondering
what the nest scene will ing .
the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best ,
which 
it seems ,
if the major purpose for film after all .
the plot is unpredictable 
yet the event
as they unravel
are completely logical .
perhaps the best feature of this film
if to tell a story of the spanish civil war
as it affected the person .
it was a major event of the 20th century ,
yet hardly any american know of it .
in fact 
in 40 year of university teaching 
i averaged about one student a semester
who had even heard of it ,
much less any
who could say anything comprehensive about it
-- and the overwhelming number of student were merit scholar ,
all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education .
so 
in one way 
this film is a good way
to begin a study of that event ,
keeping in mind
that
when one thread is pulled a great deal of history
is unraveled .
the appreciation of this film is 
therefore 
in direct relation to the amount of one 's knowledge .
to view this film
as another coming of age movie is the miss
the movie completely .
