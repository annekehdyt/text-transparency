i thought
this was an awesome movie .
the theme song is sweet !
: ) anyway 
the only thing
that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning ,
when everything should have been normal .
it was very weird and unrealistic .
the big cable company is mainly what i am talking about .
apart from that 
the movie was very creative .
i think
that all the acting was well done ,
the actor acted out their character ' personality perfectly .
everything fit together well .
it really is a shame
that their is not a soundtrack .
that would have been great !
because this is a canadian film ,
and
because it is one of my favorite ,
i give this movie a 10/10 !
