this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s 
jack pearl
( radio 's `` baron munchausen '' )
as well as jimmy durante .
however 
7-1/2 decade later 
it is being billed as a three stooge film
because they are the only one in the film
who the average person would recognize today .
film fanatic will also recognize
the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts.as for the stooge ,
this is a film from there very early day
-- before mgm had any idea what to do with the team .
at this point 
they were known as `` ted healy and his stooge ''
as healy was the front man .
fortunately for the stooge 
they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man
( read up on him
-- you will see what i mean )
and the rest is history .
within a year 
they were making very successful short for columbia and executive at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team .
this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm 
a great studio
which had no idea what to do with comedy
( such as the film of buster keaton 
laurel and hardy 
abbott and costello and other ) .
in fact 
up
until they left for columbia ,
mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film role
-- including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady .
and 
oddly 
in this film they did not act as a team
-- they just did various supporting role 
such as larry
playing the piano !
this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle .
when they are rescued and ought home ,
all sense of structure to the film falls apart
and the film becomes almost like a variety show
-- punctuated by scene with the lead here and there .
as for pearl 
i could really see
why he never made a successful transition to film ,
as he has the personality of a slug
( but slightly less welcome ) .
as for durante 
i never knew
what the public saw in him
-- as least as far as his film are concerned --
he was loud and ... loud !
he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton 's career
to make this film .
together 
pearl and durante rely on lot of verbal humor
( ? )
and vaudeville-style routine
that tend to fall rather flat.in this film ,
the stooge
they did not yet have the right chemistry .
seeing healy doing the job
that moe did in their later film
is odd .
what they did in the film was pretty good ,
but
because all the segment were short ,
they came on and off camera too quickly
to allow them to really get into their routine .
stooge fan might be very frustrated at this ,
though die-hard fan may want to see this so
that they can complete their life-long goal
of seeing everything stooge
-- even the rotten joe derita and joe besser film
( oh ,
and did
they got bad after the death of shemp and curly )
.overall 
the film is rather dull and disappointing .
however 
there are a couple interesting thing
to look for in the mess .
at about the 13 minute mark 
you will see a ief scene
where a tour guide on a bus is singing .
look carefully ,
as this is walter brennan in a role
you would certainly never expect !
another unusual thing
to look for in the film
is the `` clean as a whistle '' song
starting at about 22 minute into the film .
this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called `` pre-code '' scene
that never would have been allowed in film after 1934
( when the production code was strengthened ) .
despite the word `` clean '' in the title ,
it is a very titillating number with naked woman
showing lot of flesh
-- enough to stimulate but not enough
to really show anything !
it is quite shocking
when seen today ,
though such excess were pretty common in the early 1930s .
finally 
at the 63 minute mark 
see jimmy durante set race relation back a few decade .
see the film 
you will see that i mean !
