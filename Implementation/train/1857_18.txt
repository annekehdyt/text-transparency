we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor .
we may confess the truth of what we see ,
without being stupid 
confess ,
that this show is in many aspect just incomprehensible
and that it is clear ,
that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept.well ,
obviously many person like such stuff .
i do not .
i prefer well thought and planed show .
and i also confess ,
that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring ...
those love and drug story ... there are so many exciting soap with lot of suspense
( dallas e.g .
) ,
but twin peak can not catch my attention .
i do not care about those person 
except cooper and gordon cole .
