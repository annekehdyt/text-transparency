without reiterating what was said above about this movie ,
i would like to add
that i was looking forward to watching this film ... the cast/location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc ... it had a vague shadow of 'do
not look now ' about the storyline from the beginning .
a stay in different surrounding
( italy again )
to dim the hearteak of loss ...
or perhaps that is how i saw it ?
so consequently i sat there
waiting for the story to unfold
and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country ... .and i
sat there
and sat there ... .and guess what ?
nothing actually happens !
and i mean nothing ! !
you are not even given the chance
to get into the character
as they are so 1 dimensional
and vacuous..you are led to believe from the pace of the movie
that something was going to happen to turn the whole film
on it is head ... the eldest daughter flirtation with the local vespa boy ,
had great scope
to take the movie in another direction ,
the youngest daughter vision of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise 
the father attempts
at being seduced by one of his female student
felt ridiculous
given his age .
it felt
as if the script had a last recall made
where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any gut to the story
and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect .
when the credit started to roll
( unexpectedly )
you can not help but feel robbed of your time spent sat
watching this pile of rubbish .
