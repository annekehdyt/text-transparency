for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actor had headed south of the border and ( i guessed )
all the second rank one filled the top slot
and that left the dregs for the sex comedies.this film was a real surprise :
despite the outlandish plot
that are typical of farce ,
the actor seemed to be trying to put something into their character
and what we 
the viewer 
got back was almost true suspension of belief .
when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police ,
you almost believed
it was possible.if you are a fan of some of the better sex farce
( canadian or not )
you should definitely seek this one out .
and the big surprise 
this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .
