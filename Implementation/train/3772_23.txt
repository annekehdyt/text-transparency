this is a wonderful movie in a lot of way .
everyone in my family enjoyed it .
the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates
that there are plenty of producer
who create film
that are as visually illiant as anything
that comes from the disney studio.one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-cracking side kick for comedy relief .
and 
there are no sudden moment where the character eak into song .
i am sure
that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture :
the birth of spirit .
but it is done tastefully
and is not offensive at all .
`` spirit '' was a great eath of fresh air .
do not get me wrong .
i have loved disney for year
and will continue to do so .
`` spirit '' is another example of great animated fare .
as soon as it was over ,
my kid wanted to watch it again .
i had the same feeling .
i thoroughly recommend it .
