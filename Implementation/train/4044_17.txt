a young american woman visits her irish root and fends off a druid witch
who is out to possess her .
sound intriguing but after an interesting start 
i got lost
and spent most of the time wondering
where it was going .
the movie seems to be dithering in two direction
-- are we watching the travail of the irish-american woman
battling her alcohol problem
or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch
that returns from the past ?
the director can not seem to decide .
the two does not seem to gel and in the end
you get nowhere .
this could be so much better
done and the story seemed to drag towards the end .
this was most boring and disappointing .
