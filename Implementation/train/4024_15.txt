all dog go to heaven is 
in my opinion 
the best animated film ever made .
i am not really a big fan of animated film ,
but there is something about this one
that makes it better than any other animated film i
have seen .
the music is wonderful
as is the performance of burt reynold 
dom deluise 
and especially ken page as the king gator .
`` let 's make music together ''
is perhaps one of my favorite song from any movie musical i
have seen .
this is definitely a must see for person of all age .
