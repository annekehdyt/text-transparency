the only thing
that `` an inconvenient truth '' prove is that al gore is still an idiot .
these `` unchallenged '' expert are unchallenged
because a response to their inane hypothesis is generally beneath real science .
this is mostly false science folk .
the greatest source of greenhouse gas - co2 - is person ,
we exhale it
and unless you are willing to start sacrificing your ethren
to save the world ,
there is not a darn thing to be done .
we have heard
how the world was going to end as the result of man for more than 50 year .
fool publish a time line for their doomsday
and when the time passes 
nothing has happened .
`` an inconvenient truth '' is just another vehicle
with which a disingenuous faction of american society can peddle their poop.and
as to al leaving the tobacco business
because of his sister 's death from cancer ,
that is a load too .
al could not run his farm any better
than he could run the country .
he was losing money on the operation
because he did not care to farm
when he could make more $ on speaking tour .
the only global warming
that is unchallenged
is the hot air
produced by this gasbag !
