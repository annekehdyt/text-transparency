if another hitler ever arises 
it will be thank in part to nonsense like this film ,
which propagates the absurd notion
that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start .
far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land ,
sane person would cross the street
to avoid him ,
and he would have died in a ditch 
nameless and unknown.anyone
who reads the account of hitler 's close companion -
the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance - will be struck by the fact
that person found him a kindly 
intelligent 
generous man .
he was also a illiant orator ,
and the fact
that his speech seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the time
in which they were made ,
when strutting pomposity was common in political speech .
ditto the overstated anti-semitism ,
which was neither a central plank of the early nazis -
who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the time .
the film makes it look
as though hitler 's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust.if
you want to identify the next person
who will cause the death of ten of million ,
you can ignore fleck-lipped raver life the one portrayed here .
look instead for a charming 
charismatic man
whose compelling speech inspire the entire nation ,
and whose political work visibly and materially benefit the country .
i am afraid
his personality will be much more like barack obama 's than fred phelps'.i hoped for much here ,
and got nothing but caricature .
the fool
who made this thing
perpetrated a crime against reality .
this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness ' .
