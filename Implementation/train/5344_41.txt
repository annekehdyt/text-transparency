this 
despite not being the original -
it began life as a play in central europe - has weathered the several incarnation
that followed
( mgm 's own remake with period song in the good old summertime ,
the broadway show
she loves me 
even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of year ago )
and remains the definitive version and the one
they all
have to beat .
several previous commenter have identified the contributing factor
that make it so successful
and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble
playing rather than just two lead
as so often happens today - try 
for example ,
removing ugarte 
ferrari 
renault etc from casablanca
and yes you would still have rick and ilsa and viktor lazslo
but they had just be frosting
without the rich cake mixture below .
jimmy stewart and maggie sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable lead
but how much ighter they shine
when their performance are reflected in those of frank morgan 
felix bressart 
joseph schildkraut and andy hardy 's sara haden and this is before we factor in that lubitsch 'touch ' .
okay 
maybe they were a tad more naive 
innocent even ,
in that jurassic age
but how many genuine film lover 
sated with scatology 
screwing and in-your-face sex 
turn back to those day of story 
style 
slickness and skill and wallow in great movie like this one .
by far the best thing about this technological age is not csi but dvd
that can at one and the same time make these classic available to nostalgic
and show the matrix freaks how the big boy used to do it .
