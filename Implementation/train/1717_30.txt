i just watched this movie on starz .
let me go through a few thing
i thought
could have been improved ;
the acting 
writing 
directing 
special effect 
camera crew 
sound 
and lighting .
it also seemed as though the writer had no idea anything
that had to do with the movie .
apparently back in 2007 ,
when the dollar was stronger
you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber
that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million .
now-a-day those thing cost about $ 3 billion
and they can not go invisible .
apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour .
there was a completely random lesbian scene ,
which i did not mind ,
but it seemed like a lame attempt
to get more guy
to see it .
the camera would randomly zoom in on actor and skip to random scene .
oh yeah 
since its a steven segal movie 
its predictable as hell .
all in all i rank it right up there with snake on a plane .
