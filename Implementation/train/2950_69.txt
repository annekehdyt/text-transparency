as it is in heaven { spoiler warning )
this was a great human drama
that stimulated my emotion and my imagination .
this is a parable revisiting the life and death of christ .
daniel is a superior gifted musician ,
who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career ,
and has to give it up .
when he joins a church choir as its can notor ,
he ings about a transformation in the life of the chorister ,
just as jesus did to the society in first century palestine .
they laugh ,
they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other ,
their fault are exposed ,
they accept each other ,
come to love each other ,
become a vital community.they include the mentally disabled young man
( ?
tore ) ,
such is their inclusiveness.the pastor ,
stig enjoyed authority
through imposing a stifling morality on the congregation ,
and that is gradually rejected by the chorister .
when stig dismisses daniel ,
there is a revolt ,
and stig is crushed .
stig represents the jewish authority of jesus ' day ,
whose insistence on obedience to the jewish law ,
provided a stark contrast to the new life by `` the golden rule ''
ought by jesus.in one dramatic scene ,
someone declares `` the church invented sin '' .
all through the film 
there is this contrast between moral-ism and vital living
( being )
.true to the christ story ,
daniel is killed by conny ,
when he beats him up ,
leaves him to drown in the river .
next scene 
we can hardly believe it
when daniel 's ( resurrected ! )
body is dragged into his room
( the tomb )
draped in a white linen sheet
( the shroud !
) 
by three woman
( three woman
kept vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel )
.daniel is drawn closely to lena 
a warm beautiful young woman
who has been betrayed by a man she loved ,
and who is now promiscuous
( jesus developed a close relationship with mary magdalene- lena-
who was probably a high class courtesan/prostitute ) .
through lena 
daniel learn to love ,
something he has longed for ,
and now finds fulfillment .the solo
sung by gaiella ,
composed by daniel ,
is all about living a full life 
in contrast to moral correctness
that leads to concern about sin ,
and what is right and wrong .
the final scene shows the choir all singing/humming in harmony 
like a mantra ,
drawing in the large audience 
exemplifying the harmony and inter-connectedness
that is our true human destiny .
