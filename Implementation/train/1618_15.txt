after going for a bike ride that day ,
lying beside a lake in a nature reserve ,
spending half an hour feeding
and talking to a donkey
who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it ,
this film made absolute sense to me.the imagery of the film was beautiful
and that is all you need .
switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done.reminded me of baraka
( 1992 )
but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph.this comment requires a minimum of ten line ,
ten line is the minimum not 9 line but ten .
after finishing counting all the line you realise
that there are less than ten even though less than ten line is all
that is needed
to make my comment .
