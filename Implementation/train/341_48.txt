ah 
lucio fulci 
rest in peace .
this infamous italian is mostfamous for `` zombie 
'' and the absolutely unwatchable `` thepsychic '' and `` manhattan baby . ''
well 
add this to the unwatchablelist.the plot ,
as it were ,
concern a nekkid woman
who wears a goldmask and a g-string .
she wants the power of a young dubbedstud
who has a set of magic arrow and a bow .
they are magicbecause they glow .
arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig ,
and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flataction sequence .
in the end 
the nekkid chick is defeated ,
but notbefore taking the mask off
and reminding me why i oke up withmy high school girlfriend.fulci bathe every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen withsmoke .
nothing like a smoky orange action sequence
to make youcrave sunny delight and a cigarette .
the special effect arelaughable .
in one sequence 
our ambiguously gay duo areattacked by dozen of arrow
that are obviously pin scratch onthe film itself .
the majority of the effect budget must have beenspent on the fulci-licious gore ,
which consists entirely of spurtingwound .
hey 
we can all use a good spurting wound once in awhile ,
but
when you get into spurting wound overkill ,
it gets boring.i kept having to play with the ightness setting on my tv anywayjust
to see what the heck was happening.there is lot of talk of fulfilling omen and prophecy ,
so let medo a little look into the future ...
if you find this movie and watch it ,
you will regret it .
the scene on the video box
( by medium )
does notappear in the film in any context whatsoever .
`` conquest '' is a conjob .
what mst3k could have done with this !
this is rated
( r )
for strong physical violence 
strong gore 
femalenudity 
ief male nudity 
and mild sexual content .
