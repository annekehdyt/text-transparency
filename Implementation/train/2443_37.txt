most movie i can sit through easily ,
even if i do not particularly like the movie .
i am the type of person
who recognizes great film
even if i do not like the genre .
this is the first movie i could not stand to watch .
cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen
-- and i have seen a lot of movie .
the acting is okay
( myer is good as the cat ,
it is just
that he is really annoying ) .
the silly songs the cat sing were boring and monotonous 
even for the child in the audience .
the plot drags on and on 
and viewer must suffer through poor dialogue .
the `` witty '' parental remark are disgusting 
not funny
( i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe
being compared to 
well 
a type of person person call a `` ho '' ) .
even though the movie is really short ,
it seemed to last forever .
do not waste your time .
i know small kid
who hated this movie .
if child can not stand it ,
i do not know how any adult can .
i would like to fume more about this film
but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it .
i hated it !
so 
in summary 
do not spend 90 minute of your life watching this !
see a good movie ! 1/10 star
-- the lowest review i have ever given a movie .
