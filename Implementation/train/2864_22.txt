he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurt like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... yeah ,
you get it ,
a stupid rhyming genie
who can not act ,
in a stupid movie with horrible special effect .
oh 
and its confusing as hell .
i am not even gon na go on .
let 's just say ,
it belongs in the `` its so bad 
its funny '' category .
watch it once with your buddy
and get a good laugh .
but do not expect anything spectacular .
