updated january 1st 
2006parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner opera or music dramas ,
to be more accurate ,
( meistersinger is the other . )
though it is hard to imagine it as the `` top of anyone 's pop '' .
the lietto 
by the composer as usual 
is a muddle of religion 
paganism 
eroticism 
and possibly even homo-eroticism ,
and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry.wagner ,
being a famous anti-semite ,
( klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villain . )
naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted
( not for want of rw 's trying ! )
hermann levi ,
who was his favorite conductor !
( go figure ! )
kundry 
a most mixed-up-gal and another likely jewish surrogate 
is both villainous or benevolent ,
depending on the scene.considering
that many video version of parsifal seem on the stodgy side ,
this film of the opera is 
in comparison 
a eath of fresh air .
hans-j\u00fcrgen syberberg 
the director 
has ought considerable imagination
to it
but it is hard to know
why he made some of his choice .
for example :
the notorious dual parsifal
( of each gender !
) 
the puppet 
the death-mask-of-wagner set and various doll and symbol such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scene .
( if i remember ,
the `` real '' engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music
to pad out the scene change . )
though wagner himself died much too early
to be an actual nazi 
many of his descendant
( as well as his second wife cosima . )
were at least fellow-traveler ,
including their grandson wolfgang wagner
who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age .
in fact 
wolfgang 's son gottfried wagner 
in complete opposition to his father 
has tried to come to term honestly with his great-grandfather.syberberg 
too ,
seems politically ambiguous from what i have read .
in 1977 
he made a well-known film on hitler 
`` hitler :
ein film aus deutschland ''
( sometime called `` our hitler '' in english . ) .
since it lasts all of 8 hour
and has not been widely distributed ,
most person have not seen it
( including myself .
) .armin jordan 
the conductor of the audio cd
on which this film is based ,
plays amforta
( sung by wolfgang sch\u00f6ne )
edith clever
( yvonne minton )
plays kundry 
michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifal
( both sung by reiner goldberg. ! )
and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz
and klingsor.though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all
( except kundry ? )
have been described
as having aged considerably between act 2 and 3 ,
no one looks a day older by the end of the opera .
( the magic of the grail ?
in this opera the grail is the cup
from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent time 
an idea i find preposterous !
)
.the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable
and the dvd seems to have improved the sound 
if not the picture 
to a great extent .
( yes 
i agree
that `` kna 's '' approach is superior 
even on the second 
stereo 
version but he is probably superior to all recorded version on the whole .
) not a parsifal for all wagnerite
but i think
it works quite well as a filmed opera .
