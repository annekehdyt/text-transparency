this was not the worst movie i have ever seen ,
but that is about as much
as can be said about it .
it starts off with some good atmosphere ;
the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating ,
the mood is set to `` eerie '' .
and then ... nothing .
well 
something .
just something
that clearly do not fit in ...
and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critter ,
and the hospital they have taken over .
i mean 
come on 
biker dud ?
some band watched a bit too much gwar.my personal favorite was the head demon ,
who looks rather a lot like a middle-aged trucker desperately attempting menace ,
while simultaneously looking like he had really like prefer to sag down on an afghan-covered couch ,
undo his belt ,
pop a can of cheap beer
( probably schlitz ) ,
and watch the game .
honestly 
i have seen far scarier trucker .
at truckstop .
drinking coffee .
wwwwoooooohhhhhhoooooooo ! ! ! !
scary !
! the other monster are even more cartoonish 
and even less scary .
at least 
on the dvd 
the video give some explanation of their presence in the hospital ...
they apparently just randomly pop up in place 
play some bippy `` metal '' ,
and cause person to be dead a bit .
barring a few good special effect ,
and acting
that is not entirely terrible
given a lack of decent writing ,
there is just nothing here .
it is a background-noise movie only .
