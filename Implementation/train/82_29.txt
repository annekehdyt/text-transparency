as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach ,
dudley moore is perfect
as a grown man trapped in childhood .
as it turned out ,
the role fit moore so perfectly ,
it trapped him as an actor as well .
many disappointment soon followed
( including this film 's pale sequel ) ,
yet that does not diminish the charm or appeal of this picture ,
which is cleverly written and directed .
some of moore 's drunk scene are forced ,
part of the film are wobbly ,
but the cast perform with so much relish
it is a difficult movie
to resist .
it has a very big heart
and gives oscar-winner john gielgud a sly ,
dryly amusing role as arthur 's valet 
hobson ;
his relationship with arthur is delicious
and they have a miraculous rapport .
liza minnelli
( as a blue-collar love-interest )
is sassy in a low-key and moore
is ash 
but deft and lively ;
he never shook off the shadow of arthur ,
but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish .
