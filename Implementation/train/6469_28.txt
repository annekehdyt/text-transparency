just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival .
just before going i came here
to see
how it was rated ,
and at that time it was 7.4 
a pretty nice rate ...
after 15 minute i was dying to get out
( never did this ) ,
but felt embarrassed to do so
as the producer of the movie was in the screening.i did not like at all ,
the dialog are shallow and lead nowhere ,
the character are shallower than the dialog 
nothing lead anywhere 
and the worst and worst :
plenty of siemen and organic advertising on the movie .
despite the fact
that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself ,
i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemen mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top ; or another character
having a bath or cutting her hair
just to have organic shampoo displayed enormously on the screen !
all of this would be bearable
if the plot 
character 
romance 
anything was good ,
but was bad ,
really bad !
a `` do not know how to do '' sex-in-the-city.do not waste your time or money .
