ok. i admit .
i am one of those nerd
who have spent all to many hour with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television
set watching science fiction series .
star trek
( next generation )
was my first space date ,
and since then i have switched partner regularly .
i have seen'em all ,
it seems ,
and my favorite are \u00ab lexx \u00bb 
\u00ab farscape \u00bb and the new \u00ab battlestar galactica \u00bb 
in other word :
the newest 
state of the art space operas .
but 
i also have a general crush on the old fashioned one 
the cheap one 
like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show \u00ab blakes7 \u00bb .
here 
the budget are smaller than hobbit ,
the special effect seem to be made on a commodore 64 ,
but who cares
when the script are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor 
the acting dead serious and at time even high class ?
but why do they always speak english in the space future ?
because this is not the future ,
it is fantasy for kid .
still 
it can be irritating at time .
me ,
being a norwegian ,
have often damned this appalling fact
that one never makes genre series 
like science fiction 
for scandinavian viewer .
i never ever thought of the fact
that this might have happened .
but it did 
actually 
once 
and even in my own homeland 
norway .
i was two year old
when the so called fjernsynsteatret
( tv theater section )
of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer
( the stowaway )
.when i first heard of it ,
i was not surprised of the fact
that until this day 
the show has only been screened once in norway ,
making it impossible for me to actually see it .
it went on swedish 
danish and finnish television also ,
in it is time ,
but that was a long time ago .
there have been no video or dvd release of it 
not a surprise either ,
and when it was screened on an art house cinema ,
this happened in bergen 
a city far far away from oslo
( where i live ) .
and then there is another fact about \u00ab blindpassasjer \u00bb
that did not surprise me ,
that it was written by the two norwegian author tor \u00e5ge bringsv\u00e6rd and jon bing
( bingandbringsv\u00e6rd ) .
this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegian in the seventy ;
they published anthology
and wrote what they called fable prose .
in my opinion 
bringsv\u00e6rd is the most interesting of the two writer ,
and has written several great and entertaining novel 
masterpiece even 
some of them hilarious 
such as \u00ab bazar \u00bb and \u00ab syvsoversken dystre frokost \u00bb .
no other than this guy 
also an acclaimed dramatist 
could construct the script of \u00ab blindpassasjer \u00bb .when i finally got to watch it ,
it was because a strange swede
who recorded the three episode on vcr in the 80 's ,
eventually managed to transform it to dvd
and give it to me .
he was a nice bloke .
so i sat down
and watched it 
with swedish subtitle 
bad sound and some scrape and error ;
but the thing came through
and i was surprised
that i eventually came to love it.the exterior scene with the spaceship
and planet are better than the one in blakes7 ,
and the credit goes to caprino studio
( who made the famous fl\u00e5klypa grand prix ) ,
and the interior of the marco polo
( the space ship )
works better
than i would expected .
the acting is typically theatrical ,
but it works better
than when they play ibsen ,
to put it mildly ,
and bj\u00f8rn floberg carries his role solidly ,
as does trini lund .
the legendary actress henny moan delivers her line in a serious
and laid back tone
which fits the genre ,
but this is an ensemble play ,
and i am happy to say
that ola b. johannesen carries his mustache with nobility ,
and marit \u00f8stbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.but is it really that good ?
well 
one have to swallow the rather aupt ending 
the pretentious criticism of \u00ab modern society \u00bb 
but yes ,
it is 
well ,
not really really really fantastic 
but charming 
cool 
nostalgic and pleasant .
one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi .
