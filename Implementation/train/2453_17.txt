the most important thing about this movie is the illiant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown 
guineas artist and fighter
who despite of her physical condition
overcame all the odd .
as a person
who did work with patient with cereal palsy ,
i can assure you
that their performance were shockingly convincing .
the enormous support
that christy got form his family 
low-income 
working class dubliner ,
encouraged him to do the impossible
and this picture depicted this support illiantly have not read the book ,
but the dialog were written wisely to capture christy brown 's witty arrogant personality .
i do recommend this movie to everyone 
especially to classic movie-lover .
