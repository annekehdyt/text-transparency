after too many bad memory ,
i took to skipping this episode each time
it showed up in the season 2 sequence .
i recently watched it again just to remind me why .
i have always considered this the worst st :
tng episode
( with the exception of `` shade of gray 
''
which barely counts as an episode at all )
.i keep
listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author 's writing 101 teacher :
`` show 
do not tell ! ''
from deanna troi 's pronouncement ,
and everyone else 's constant elbowing reminder about what a charming 
dangerous rogue okona is 
to guinan 's explanation about how funny her droid joke is
( it is not ) ,
to the who-care resolution to the conflict ,
there is not a plot point
that is not highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification ,
and there are not a believable moment in any of it .
unfortunately 
bill campbell 
a charming actor in other circumstance 
is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machination of the plot .
on the other hand 
it could be that no one short of john barrowman
( jack harkness from `` doctor who '' )
could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role .
( zero point 
by the way 
to the data subplot .
while i think
joe piscopo stopped being funny decade ago ,
he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here .
although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way .
) on a good day 
you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode .
me 
i would rather skip ahead to `` time squared '' or `` q who . ''
