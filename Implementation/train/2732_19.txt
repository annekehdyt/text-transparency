the film looks like
as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorist .
it should actually be called dino crap.there is nothing good about this movie..
even the actor are not worth a penny .
do not waste your time watching this movie .
the director should be shot in the head
for having the mentality
to create such a bad movie .
i mean is not he ashamed of looking at person faces
after they have seen his movie ?
the dinocroc looks
as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut-and-paste stuff .
and its the same old story .
man plays god .
creates some creature .
it escapes and is happy eating person .
and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come
and kill it .
bla bla.. u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minute of the movie
