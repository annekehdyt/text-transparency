in an alternate 1950s 
where an outeak of the undead
( caused by a mysterious 'space-dust ' )
has been contained through the use of special electronic collar 
a young loner 
timmy 
finds a friend in fido
( billy connelly ) ,
his family 's recently acquired domesticated zombie.fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy ,
whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son
( or for his hot-to-trot wife ,
played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss )
having been psychologically scarred as a child
( when he was forced to shoot his own father ,
who tried to eat him !
) .timmy runs into a spot of bother 
however ,
when his putrid pal 's collar goes on the blink ,
and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour .
with the authority on fido 's trail 
trouble ewing with a pair of local bully ,
and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help ,
will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend ?
a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick 
fido is a thoroughly entertaining 
deliciously dark comedy
that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour .
taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius ,
and the result is simply one of the most original film
to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead ' theme
that i have seen.connelly 's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame 
along with day of the dead 's bub 
and return of the living dead 's tarman ;
it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse ,
but the big yin 's performance is so fine
that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus !
the rest of the cast also give commendable performance 
with young k'sun ray
( as timmy )
and ms.moss deserving special mentions\u0097ray ,
because 
for one so young ,
he puts in a particularly assured turn ,
and moss
because she is so bloody yummy !
this is the third zombie film
that i have watched this week
( the other being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead ) ,
and 
to my surprise 
it is also the best .
director andrew currie has given fan of the genre something truly original to treasure
and is a talent
to be watched in the future.8.5/10 
rounded up to 9 for imdb .
