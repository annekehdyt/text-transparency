a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief 's daughter ,
leading to much hate and violence.this crackpot nudie feature is fun
to look at ,
though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level .
the terrible costume and the fact
that all the indian are obviously white ,
makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production
that it is press material pretends
it to be.in short 
the plentiful nudity
( the real reason for watching this )
is good .
everything else is not .
there is definitely better example of both genres.more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch
and features not one 
but two member of the manson family 
catherine share and bobby beausoleil ,
who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screen of the pussycat theater !
