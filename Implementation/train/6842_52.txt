the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 year
to make a `` swedish '' film
- the first
being susan sontag 's `` brother carl ''
( which was made in sweden 
with swedish actor 
no less ! )
the result ?
oscar wilde said
it best ,
in reference to dickens ' `` the old curiosity shop '' :
`` one would have to have a heart of stone
not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell . ''
pretty much the same thing here .
`` interior '' is chock full of solemnly intoned howler .
( `` i am afraid of my anger . ''
looking into the middle distance :
`` i do not like who i am becoming . '' )
the directorial quotation
( to use a polite term )
from bergman are close to parody .
the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how illiant and talented they are 
to the point of strangulation .
( `` i read a poem of your the other day .
it was in - i do not know - the new yorker . ''
`` oh .
that was an old poem .
i reworked it . '' )
far from not caring about these person 
however 
i found them quite hilarious .
much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen 's earlier film -
only he is directed his actor to play the line straight .
having not cast himself in the movie ,
he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics 
intonation 
and neurotic habit ,
turning her into an embarrassing surrogate
( much like kenneth branagh in `` celeity '' )
.the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother -
seems to be lifted more or less from bergman 's `` winter light 
''
the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst .
it all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural trick :
the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper 
the towering surf
that dwarfs the person walking on the beach .
etc 
etc.allen 's later `` serious '' film are less embarrassing ,
but also far less entertaining .
i will take `` interior . ''
woody 's rarely made a funnier movie .
