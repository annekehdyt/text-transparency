i discovered this movie on ifc ,
and i thought
it would be interesting .
for `` tiny '' love story 
some of the story really dragged on in this movie .
the fact
that none of these woman had name almost
makes you suspect
that the actress were talking about their own real sex life ,
including kathy baker and alicia witt .
i have to admit ,
i want to start seeing some more romantic view of first sexual encounter again 
like in `` strike !
( 1998 ) 
''
when odette sinclair 's acquaintance started asking about her presumed first time ,
and tweety asked `` was it beautiful ?
`` some might think
re-enactment and flashback would improve this movie .
i think
it would make thing even worse .
it does not necessarily have to be hardcore porn
to get my attention ,
but somehow i just expected more .
