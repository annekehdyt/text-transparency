howling ii
( 1985 )
was a complete 180 from the first film .
whilst the first film was campy and creepy .
the second one was sleazy and cheesy .
the production value on this one are pretty bad
and the acting is atrocious .
the other of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis ' .
the `` scene '' from the first film was badly re-created .
a skinny plain looking woman accompanies o '
( reb brown )
to the old country
( romania )
to uncover the mystery to her sister 's murder/transformation/death .
christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two .
sybil danning and her two biggest asset appear as stirba 
the head werewolf of the romania .
she also suffers from a bad case of morning face 
ewww ! bad movie .
there is nothing good about this stinker .
i am surprise philippe mora directed this picture
because he is usually a good film-maker .
the film is so dark
that you need a flashlight to watch it
( no 
not the content but the film stock itself ) .
to round the movie off you get a lousy `` punk '' performance from a damned wannabe `` babel '' .
maybe if they forked over a couple of extra buck
they could have got the real deal instead of an imitation.best
to avoid
unless you are desperate
or you lost the remote
and you are too lazy to change the channel .
