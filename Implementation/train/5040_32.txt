i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k 
and oh boy ,
even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad .
imagine someone
whose competence with a camera
could be out done by a monkey.the highlights
( what little there were )
came from the special effect ,
which were `` ok '' .
the acting for the most part was also `` ok '' ;
though nothing special ,
it was of a higher quality than other b-movie i
have seen in the past.the rest of this movie
is dismally bad ,
the camera work often looks
like they have just put the camera man on roller skate
and pushed him along .
the story
( if it can be called that )
is so full of hole
it is almost funny ,
it never really explains
why the hell he survived in the first place 
or needs human flesh
in order to survive .
the script is poorly written
and the dialogue verge on just plane stupid .
the climax to movie
( if there is one )
is absolutely laughable.if
you can not find the mst3k version ,
avoid this at all cost .
