everyone knows about this ''zero day '' event .
what i think
this movie did
that elephant did not is that they made us see
how these guy were .
they showed their life for about a year .
throughout the movie we get to like them 
to laugh with them even though we totally know
what they are gon na do .
and that gives me the chill .
cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comment ,
and i just thought
cal was a sweet guy .
even though i knew what was gon na happen you know ?
even at the end of the movie
when they were about to commit suicide
and just deciding
if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought
this was funny
but still i was horrified to see their head blown off .
of course i was .
i got to like them .
they were wicked 
maybe ,
but i felt like they were really normal guy ,
that they did not really realize it .
but i knew
they were.that is 
imo 
the main force of this movie .
it makes us realize
that our friend 
or relative 
or anyone 
can be planning something crazy ,
and that we will not even notice it .
this movie ,
as good
as it was ,
made me feel bad .
and that is why i can not go to sleep right now .
there is still this little feeling in my stomach .
butterfly .
