steve carell star as a person
who you can relate to
( sort of )
in dan in real life 
a film
which i expected not to like
but ended up liking it .
not that the movie is laugh out loud funny
it is just
that it has a big heart .
we all like steve carell ,
this is not what fan of the office would expect to see from him ,
but you know what 
i liked this movie .
carell star as dan burn 
a widowed father
who 's daughter do not really like him .
one weekend 
him and his daughter travel down to see his family .
while there ,
he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman .
when he gets back to his house ,
he finds out
that his other mitch
( played by dane cook )
is dating this woman
( played by juliette binoche )
.dan in real life 
at time 
i found a bit unbelievable .
are the burn family really the kind of person
who do exercises together
and play board game together
and do a bunch of other family thing ?
i would highly doubt that .
i do not know any family
who is like that .
is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up ?
no.dan in real life :
