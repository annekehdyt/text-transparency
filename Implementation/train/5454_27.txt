great woody allen ?
no .
good woody allen ?
definitely .
i found myself ,
along with the audience in attendance 
laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen line
we have heard in a while .
the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johansson 's `` father '' ... well 
sort of .
some have said
johansson plays `` a young dianne keaton . ''
i beg to differ .
she plays woody 's dialogue ,
which 
in his comedy 
always has a very similar feel ... like 
well 
a woody allen comedy .
that is fine for us woody appreciator .
she certainly did woody 's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy 
melinda/melinda .
some may find woody 's humor tiresome 
but for those of us
who love it
when it is done right ,
we look forward to the next .
