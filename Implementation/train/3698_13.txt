the dubbing/translation in this movie is downright hilarious
and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick .
i have not laughed so hard in my life
as i just did watching zombi 3
( and i have seen some really bad dubbing in my life ,
believe me ) .
seriously 
the filmmaker could re-edit this movie
and release it as a comedy
and make million of dollar .
it is just that funny.but ...
if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie is not your cup of tea ,
then avoid this at all cost .
