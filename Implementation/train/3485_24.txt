this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon .
the `` sister '' in law are female lawyer and judge
who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husband for abusive treatment of their spouse
and won one woman a divorce
she desperately wanted through a muslim council .
it is rather long
-- about two hour --
but fascinating in term both of the individual plaintiff and defendant and the lawyer
who successfully represented them in court room
presided over by female judge .
it will leave you ,
as it left me ,
with many question about exactly how this change occurred .
how and when did woman come to occupy position of authority in the cameroon ?
have the several case
featured in this film had a significan not effect on the treatment of woman generally by their spouse ?
was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court 
against the express wish of the husband 
a one time event ?
i am not suggesting
that the film maker could have answered these question .
they made the movie two year ago 
not yesterday .
and the movie they made deserve a wide audience .
