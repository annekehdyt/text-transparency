saw this in the theater in '86
and fell out of my chair laughing more than once .
`` beirut '' ... '' what do you know about beirut ? `` ...
`` beirut ... he is the best damn baseball player
who ever lived .
`` you know
how it is going to end
but it has a great time getting there .
the training scene are very funny
but the best scene may be the one
when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcon v. viking monday night football game
while attempting a make-up dinner with their wives.william and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one
and it is too bad
that it is overlooked as a top notch comedy .
