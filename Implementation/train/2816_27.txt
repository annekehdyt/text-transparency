awful 
simply awful .
it proves my theory about `` star power . ''
this is supposed to be great tv
because the guy
who directed
( battlestar )
titanica is the same guy
who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick .
b o r i n g.find something a thousand time more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound .
1/10
( i rated it so high b/c there
are not any negative score in the imdb.com rating system .
) -zaphoidps :
my theory about `` star power '' is :
the more `` star power ''
used in a show ,
the weaker the show is .
( it is called an indirect proportionality :
quality 1/ '' star power '' 
less `` sp '' makes for better quality 
etc .
another way
to look at it is :
`` more is less .
`` )
