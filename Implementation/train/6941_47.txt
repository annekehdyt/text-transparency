this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of .
the japanese person
( ? )
who star in this must have been really desperate for a job ,
or we are just friend .
here is the scoop :
three thug torture the hell out of a helpless woman ,
they use all kind of thing
to eventually kill her ,
they burn her ,
kick her 
spin here
around in a chair
( over 200 time !
) 
they use sound torture
( by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hour !
it do not sound that bad at all ,
but it can make you go nuts ) .
they throw gut
( probably from an animal )
at her while sh knocked out ,
and she freaks
when she wakes up .
and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen !
if you have not heard of these film ,
and watch one
without knowing
that it is a simulated snuff film ,
you will think
it is !
( just ask charlie sheen )
this is guaranteed to freak person out
and make some sick !
like i said pure underground .
check it out
if you are a fan of underground horror 
or foreign gore .
if your not i highly recommend you read-up on the series
before watching !
from the gore 
shock 
and creativity aspect
it gets a 10 ,
but from the storyline and all
that stuff it is a 1. an underground classic ...
my final rating is a 8/10
