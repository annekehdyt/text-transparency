i believe
sarafina is a tremendous effort of whoopi goldberg .
besides her 
there are no other star in the film
and her role is smaller than the title character 
sarafina .
since i work in a high school with urban child ,
i think
this is an important film
to show south african history of apartheid .
sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher 's relationship with her student 
sarafina .
i bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore .
i watched it and fast forwarded through the musical number .
but i strongly recommend this film to educator and their student to understand .
now while i do not know the other actor and actress in the film ,
i assume
that they are very popular in south africa and i am glad
that they filmed with a south african cast and crew with the exception of goldberg in a small role
but if it gets person to see this movie ,
than whoopi reach worldwide appeal .
