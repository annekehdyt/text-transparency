although it got some favorable press
after playing at the toronto intl .
film festival 
there were a number of reason
not to expect too much from this .
one
-- it is an ultra-low budget canadian film .
two
-- it is written 
directed and starring the same person
( usually a bad sign ,
unless it is woody allen 
george clooney or one or two other respected filmmaker ) .
but despite my watching it with lowered expectation ,
it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought
possible.in a nutshell
-- bad script 
bad acting ,
terrible directing !
do not waste your time or money on this turkey .
it claims to be a comedy ,
but i only laughed twice .
plus 
there is awful music blaring throughout .
how this got any attention i will never know .
