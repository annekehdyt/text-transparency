monstrous mother-son-duo
( alice krige and brian krause )
sucks life-force of virgin ,
and their newest target is pretty but lonely tanya
( madchen amick ) .
however 
these monster are allergic to cat 's scratch ...
i
have never been fan of sleazy 
overrated bestsellerist like king 
koontz or barker 
but this b-movie ,
written by mr dung himself ,
is actually not near as bad
than it could be .
yes 
it is sometimes jaw-droppingly atrocious ,
but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touch :
good old-fashioned graveyard 
eerie soundtrack and candlelit-gothic-house-scene 
mirror
showing the monstrous form of the villain 
etc .
of course 
the film is polluted by mr dung 's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat person ,
leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher ,
but there is rose among manure .
