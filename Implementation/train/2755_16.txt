this film has got several key flaw .
the first and most significan not of which is the clear lack of a good plot !
this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch
but also sends the watcher certain feeling of hopelessness ,
as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life .
this means
that the film can not captivate
it is audience ,
instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film
and everything associated with it !
in short 
it really is very very very very very very very bad !
do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe ,
you will find
it far more interesting and enjoyable
than watching terminator woman .
