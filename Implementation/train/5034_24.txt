first of all
when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu ,
i was definitely excited .
brenda song 
one of the hottest girl on disney channel 
would be doing martial art
and i was fine with that ...
until i saw the movie .
the action was poorly constructed ,
the movie could not have realated to anyone ,
the fighting was unrealistic
and it sucked ... along with the plot .
if you really think
about it is a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer 
a girl
who is the descendant of other warrior
who were woman ,
a girl
wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen 
the watcher
who bug 's her
to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil .
the idea just was not all that original ,
the movie is waste of time .
