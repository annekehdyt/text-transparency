this `` screwy comedy '' seems very forced .
indeed 
the actor try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script .
and 
as a result
it does not really go anywhere .
the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant
after getting a quickie divorce just is not all that funny .
and then ,
when cooper sneak off with the baby
because he does not want it put up for adoption
just seems terribly unfunny
and it is really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy .
it is really a shame 
too ,
as the actor were more capable
than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess .
considering
that cooper made so many good comedy ,
i recommend you see them instead .
