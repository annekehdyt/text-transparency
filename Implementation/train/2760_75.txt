i am surprised
that everyone
( even the critic )
seems to think
this was a good movie .
it was the most clich\u00e9d thriller ever made
that i have seen .
we have the 'bad guy '
who wants to force the 'good guy '
( or girl in this case )
to do something or face the consequence .
the 'good girl ' in this movie must use her smart and skill to defeat the 'bad guy '
and save the day and her loved one .
using charisma 
avery ,
and even luck to save the day .
where to begin ?
well 
a young
woman by the name of lisa reisert meet a young man by the name of jackson rippner
( nice name )
at an airport .
one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems
as if fate is inging these two together .
sharing drink ,
sitting next to each other ,
seemingly getting along in every way ...
is there more to this strangeness ?
could these two be meant for each other ?
does 'fate ' have a reason for their strange and random encounter ?
well ,
as it turns out 
unfortunately yes .
jackson need to lisa to help him assassinate the director of homeland security
by moving him from one room to another so
that his man can launch an attack on him .
oh 
if she does not do this then her father is dead .
though we never learn the exact reason why
and who is really behind this madness ,
jackson more then explains how this is going to happen
and why its in lisa 's best interest to help him.of course 
lisa defeats his evil plan with her smart and in the process stabs him in the neck ,
makes him trip over chair ,
and hitting him with a field hockey stick .
oh 
and before that 
she leads him on wild chase through miami airport
where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car
that she later uses to run over the man
who was ordered to kill her father .
yeah 
right.first of all 
i find it strange
that a man like jackson
who can get his hand on high tech weaponry
need the help of a hotel manager .
could not he just sneak a bomb into the building ?
would not that make it safer for him and his team
by leaving out any third party ?
and why do character like jackson also explain
everything they are going to do to someone
they are threatening ?
does not that make it easier to stop them by the same person ?
the actor did their best considering the movie
they were given .
racheal mcadam and cillian murphy are still actor to look out for .
also 
i believe
that jayma may
( who played the 'loveable ' cynthia )
will be someone
we will see more of .
it is just too bad
they all were stuck with this.2/10
