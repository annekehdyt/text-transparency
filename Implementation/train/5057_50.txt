batman :
mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie
to be released .
( minor spoiler ahead )
the plot revolves around a new crimefighter 
the batwoman ,
who seems to be personally involved ,
for whatever reason 
in stopping a major arm shipment.although the movie is interesting enough ,
it is not as good as 'mask of the phantasm 
' 'sub-zero 
' or 'return of the joker . '
the main reason being is that it does not give off the emotional appeal the other movie did .
at the end of this movie 
we do not really feel sorry for anyone
as we did in the other 
especially 
'sub-zero . '
there is no real tragedy
that made the other animated movie special for us .
even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic ' character
( as mr. freeze or phantasm were ) .
not only that 
but batwoman 's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff ' and dull
that the viewer does not really care what happened to her
that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason
we do not get this special emotional appeal.do
not get me wrong ,
i did find the movie enjoyable .
it does have its moment 
such as ,
when the audience finds out
who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return
who was last seen in the original 'batman :
the animated series . '
the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moment.if the batwoman 's background was more interesting ,
this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker ' in my book ,
but
as it is now ,
it is in 4th
( out of 4 )
.as for the animation 
it is the same as the new batman adventure ' cartoon from the mid to late 1990 's .
the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman film ,
but it is still good nonetheless.i do recommend buying this dvd
because ,
despite its flaw ,
it is enjoyable .
but just remember ,
it is not as good as the other batman animated movie.7/10
