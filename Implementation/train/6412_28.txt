i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary ,
and i waited a good
while for this
to come through the pipe
( my local video chain ) ,
and it was worth the wait .
i like a good documentary / special interest piece ,
but this was definitely a heartfelt 
honest 
and nostalgic ,
if you will ,
look back on adolescent life .
the imagination of a child is fascinating ,
and that is where a great story begin .
rent it or buy it
if you like a good 
humorous ,
and all around entertaining documentary .
mr. stein and company have definitely come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder production of bank hold-up 
and gay-ring
that turn person gay from one glance .
they all seem rather successful in they are respectful field ,
and it was good to know
that they are all still good friend .
the dvd has a few extra trailer for other good documentary ,
and it features a number of darren 's most notable production ,
including 
crazy news .
