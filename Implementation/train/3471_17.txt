may 2004 
wonderland is fairly new in the uk .
brilliant film of a utal true story .
if you know la from the early 80 's ,
you will appreciate
how well it is captured .
the use of the element
which make up its gritty cinematic style
is original 
amplifying the experience and inging the viewer very close
to actually being there .
the use of a disjointed 'pulp fiction ' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty
concerning what really happened ,
while the direction and performance of the cast command attention 
especially val kilmer as john holme ;
an oscar for sure
if i were handing them out .
