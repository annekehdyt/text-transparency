my goodness is this movie bad .
i was totally misled by my local movie review
because this is certifiable garbage .
yeah 
yeah 
good guy wear white ,
bad guy wear black ...
.and the good guy always win .
now go home and hug your kid ,
and feel
how good hollywood has made you feel .
blech !
i can not believe
this ain dead movie was made by wes craven .
i am guessing
he needed a little money
to pay the mortgage ,
so he made this piece of dung .
it is the sort of production
that makes anyone
who watches movie regularly believe
they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.ya see ,
a bad guy wants a sweet girl
who loves her daddy to do a wittle il ' bad thing
or he is gon na hurt her daddy .
but being ms. all-american girl next door ,
we know
she is gon na save the day
and beat the bad guy ... the end .
girl power rocks.c'mon now ,
only an idiot would find this entertaining ... '' a roller coaster ride 
''
let alone something fresh or new .
all those `` super-duper '' review you see on this site are from industry hack
who are either making money off this flick ,
paying back a favor ,
or they have sold their soul to the devil.rachael mcadam is beautiful ... .yup ,
that is it .
not a good performance 
not a horrible one ... she is just cute .
she would have had to show a whole lot of skin
to save this movie .
she is not tough enough
to be a good female action lead.cillian murphy
was at least passable in 28 day .
but here he plays a dumb villain pretending
to be a smart one .
he gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5 '' mcadam ,
because after all 
she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ...
and i am sure
she owns all the tae bo tape ...
so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire .
i would not trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11.ya see ,
this movie was done before ,
except before they did it well .
go re-rent any of the die hard movie .
you have loved one in danger 
international terrorist ,
except the character are more likable and believable
and the bad guy are way more competent and interesting .
i simply do not understand
how hollywood can continue to make such crap
as if they were oblivious to the proper model
they can readily copy .
no wonder movie revenue are down.throw your $ 6 down the toilet
and save yourself 2 hour of your life
you will never get back.ciao
