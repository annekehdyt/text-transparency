why even bother reviewing this movie ?
another stupid dinosaur movie
in which top secret military guy discover those lethal
( and very fake-looking )
prehistoric monster running around killing person in gory way .
the original was bad enough ,
the sequel was even worse .
this falls somewhere in between ,
though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur film .
rating :
2/10 .
rated r for graphic violence and gore 
grisly image 
and profanity .
