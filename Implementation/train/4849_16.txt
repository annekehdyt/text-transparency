yes its an art ...
to successfully make a slow paced thriller.the story unfold in nice volume
while you do not even notice
it happening.fine performance by robin william .
the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary
and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film .
however 
the core plot is very engaging .
the movie does not rush onto you
and still grips you enough
to keep you wondering .
the direction is good .
use of light
to achieve desired affect of suspense and unexpectedness is good.very nice 1 time watch
if you are looking to lay back
and hear a thrilling short story !
