i seems in the beginning a interesting film 
a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays madrid ,
but it isn`t none of that ,
is actually a film only interesting for future film director
learning
about what not to do making a film ,
it can`t be worse in other word 
even the presence of a oscar winner
( mira sorvino )
isn`t enough to justify the $ 3.00 dollar expended
to see this film ,
the acting is horrendous
and it seems
the actor were just waiting to finish the daily shot
to go home ,
it lead to nowhere
and is boring 
weak and bad 
don`t expend time or money on this film .
