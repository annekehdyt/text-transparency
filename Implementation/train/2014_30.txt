this is a film about life 
the triumph over adversity and the wonder of the human spirit .
i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie .
this is more than just a tear-jerker 
its an engaging 
thought-provoking drama with excellent performance from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington .
7 year on 
i am amazed
that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington
only directed one other film .
nevertheless 
apart from a slow build-up 
the story of this foster child 's trial and tribulation
and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie
that stays with you
long
after you have seen it .
like many fox searchlight picture 
this was more of a sleeper hit
and did not get the mass critical acclaim it deserves .
the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me ,
there were so many way
that could have been done
and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone ,
his mother never said
a word and could only shed a tear ,
while antowne asked simply why .
her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything ,
what could she say to defend herself ?
one of the most moving cinematic scene i have seen .
