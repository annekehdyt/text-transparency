ah 
noir .
my favourite genre .
otto preminger 's follow-up to `` laura '' is a film noir
set in a postwar new york ,
where corruption and violence run rampant .
it stars dana andrew as sergeant mark dixon 
a detective
whose utal tactic have landed him in hot water with his superior .
when he accidentally kills a murder suspect ,
dixon try to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese .
dixon is close to achieving his goal
when he becomes involved with the dead man 's wife 
the beautiful morgan taylor .
of course 
in typical noir fashion 
thing quickly go down hill.while
the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise ,
it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom .
like most great noir 
it is also wonderfully paced 
sucking the viewer in right from the start.still 
like most of preminger 's workmanlike film ,
it is not something
i would watch again .
it lacks the verbal wit of wilder 
the visual flamboyance of hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of welle .
like lang 's later work 
`` sidewalk '' feel very much a `` clone ''
of what a noir should be ,
instead of something really artistically genuine .
thematically the film is nothing special .
it is about a cop
who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal .
in one scene dixon explains
that his father himself was a small time crook 
the film flirting with the notion of predestination ,
but this one scene is as far as otto goes ,
or dares
to take his ideas.the camera work
is likewise disappointing .
there is no intelligence in otto 's camera .
no effort is made to assign the camera to anything .
it does not play with space or architecture or empahsise the step-by-step police procedural .
it is just tripod set up with the occasional dolly in and out .
meaningless ,
though most person do not care about these thing .
there is 
however 
one good shot
where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangster
( noir cage )
which itself enters a vehicle-lift
( another cage )
and is taken up into the chief gangster 's lair .
like lynch 's `` blue velvet '' 
otto retopologizes the film ,
constantly likens `` uptairs '' to hell .
this works well ,
but the set design fails to reinforce it .
7/10 - otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is 
rather than toy with the possibility of where noir can go .
like `` detour '' 
`` night in the city '' 
`` scarlet street '' 
`` in a lonely place '' 
`` act of violence '' 
`` bomberang '' and `` johnny eager '' ,
`` where the sidewalk ends '' is one of those well made second tier film noir .
it is competent and engaging ,
but lacks that extra special magic .
