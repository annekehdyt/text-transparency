though i liked on the town better i really liked it .
i am a new comer
when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly .
though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently .
the first one i saw was singin in the rain
that made me a fan of gene 's .
i think
that is better too .
but i thought
that this movie was good
and like all movie there are some part
that are better than other but in my book it is an awesome movie and i love it .
frank and gene make a good team .
i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame .
but i am sticking to my gun bu saying
that i really enjoyed it ,
and that i love it !
