stewart moss star as a scientist
who is on a working trip with his wife ,
and one gets the feeling
that he was picked for this role for his ability
to roll his eye back in his head ...
imagine the audition for this.. '' can you ... no ,
that is not quite it 
thank you 
next ! `` .
anyway 
he is bitten by a bat ,
and then 
he is either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing person or ... .he is not .
for no one else sees his strange transformation ,
but he himself seems to think
that he is changing because his wedding ring pop off
when his hand turn into claw 
etc .
to its credit the movie does kind of hold back
on whether he is just nut
or whether he is actually transforming into something until almost the very end .
this has some good location and sort of a decent atmosphere at time
but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting .
kind of fun in a `` so bad it is good '' way ,
but leans more toward just plain bad .
4/10 .
