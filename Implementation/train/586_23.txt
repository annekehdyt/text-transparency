nicola mallet is a failure .
a teller in a bank ,
everyone walk all over him .
then his friend 
a writer
who 's book no one likes ,
has a plan
to change his life .
our hero tells
his boss he is quitting .
he intends to spend the rest of his life
making a great deal of money
and sleeping with a great many woman .
and he manages to do just that.if
it were not for the amount of death
( murder/suicide/natural cause )
in the film 
this would be a farce .
there are numerous jab at marriage 
politic ,
journalism and ... life.jean-louis trintignant is a likable amoral rogue .
romy schneider is at her most appealing .
definitely worth a look .
