this movie started slowly ,
then gained momentum towards the middle .
however 
the fact
that the movie ran over two night oke
that momentum at its peak .
the second part really got interesting ,
but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending .
playing football in the yard ?
really 
could it get any more sappy and maudlin ?
now i hear plan for a similar movie
based on the '70 .
i will not make any great effort
to tune into that one
if it is anything like `` the '60 . ''
