sadly 
marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page 's life
to go along with her own issue with man .
as typical in all her work 
every major male character is portrayed as weak 
bumbling 
or twisted .
to add to her fiction ,
she project idea and issue
that are not true ,
according to bettie page herself .
bettie did not leave the biz
because she thought
it was morally wrong or had religious issue
( though she became a born-again later in life ,
through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister ) .
she left it ,
because she was in her late 30 's ,
her acting career had gone nowhere
and she felt
she was losing her look .
the hint of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie 's own word
and are the director 's attempt
to claim
that any woman
who did what bettie
did
must have been victimized by man .
harron fails to point out
that bettie designed her own clothe in almost all her shoot
( not handed to her by `` sick '' fetishist ) .
harron also fails to make a point
that bunny yeager ,
who did many famous photo shoot of bettie ,
also did many `` naughty '' shoot with bettie
and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.the
only saving grace is gretchen mol look very much like bettie .
otherwise 
there are other movie and documantaries more accurate and honest to her life and the person in it .
