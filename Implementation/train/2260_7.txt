everything about this film was terrible .
to start with this film
had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever .
the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy .
it had this music through the whole film
and it started to get quite irritating.please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster
you will only be hurt
