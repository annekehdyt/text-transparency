wow 
what a waste of acting talent .
my husband and i sat there ,
both thinking 
this has to get better ,
these actress are too good to have wasted their time on this crap .
unattractive character 
hackneyed script 
and listless pacing make for a long two hour .
i actually could not hack it and left to do the grocery shopping
( cat litter being more appealing than this film ) .
the husband stayed and confirmed
that it did not get better
-- by the time buddy is killed ,
you were wishing
they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable life .
it would be infinitely more entertaining .
beautiful scenery and costume can not keep this one alive .
