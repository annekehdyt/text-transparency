`` hot million '' is a well-written ,
well-acted tale about an embezzler
who steals
( whoops !
-- too low class a word for an embezzler ,
according to peter ustinov 's lead character )
a `` hot million '' from the london anch of a u.s. corporation
by creating shell corporation on the continent
and using the firm 's ostensibly secure computer to transfer fund to them .
( remember 
spoiler police 
this is a comedy 
not a mystery . )
from 1968 
this movie 's depiction of computer may seem naive to today 's more computer-literate populace ;
but as one
who has worked with computer
since before this film was released ,
i would assert
that even then 
this smack
of having been written by and for computer illiterate ,
probably on purpose
to heighten the droll comedic aspect of this british flick .
if one has little taste for this type of entertainment ,
the movie may seem to drag in spot .
fortunately 
it has a nicely wrapped-up ending ;
unfortunately 
the end credit give no indication of the classical music used therein
-- the symphonic piece at the end and the piano-flute duet in the middle --
just the song sung by lulu
which i totally do not remember .
