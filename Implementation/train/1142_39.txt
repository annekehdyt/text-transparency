music
that grinds on the nerve like fingernail on a blackboard ,
acting
that is so zombielike
it was a shame
to waste the cast
by not making a second movie ;
casting everyone in it as true zombie
-- -with the cast of saina the teenaged witch as the hero ... a movie so downright awful
that
if `` stoner '' were still around it might be considered a cult movie -- -but 
oh so amateurish 
the script might as well have been carried around by the actor 
their line read
as they slowly shuffled through the movie
-- -banal 
illogical set modeled after la subdivision 
prop straight from toysrus !
was a movie ever made
that is so completely and totally inept ? ? ?
logic fly to the wind in this plodding 
senseless 
pointless and with a `` monster '' so stupid and uncoordinated
that it could not catch a turtle in an icebox
-- -lowcut 
leggy --
-and amazon !
it kept my attention all the way through ;
the way a terrible 
ongoing chain accident in the fog
involving multiple vehicle
keeps one watching to the very end ...
as 
after a ridiculous ray-gun fight in a prison on another planet 
a pneumaticaly-disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra-terrestrial fugitive
-- -to earth !
do not let anybody p**s on your popcorn ,
you might actually enjoy watching this one .
it is that bad !
