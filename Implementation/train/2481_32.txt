to all the reviewer on this page 
i would have to say
this movie is worth seeing .
so it was made in 1972 
so what .
the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time .
person
who did not study culture of the decade
would think
that this movie is a cheese ball .
compared to the modern series 
`left behind 
'
( which is made for our time right now )
it does look cheezy .
however 
the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion ,
which again was over 30 year in the past .
but .
the message
that is sent in this film
is very powerful 
and carefully preserved .
there is just so much to say ,
but i refuse to say it .
( for fear of spoiling it )
so go out
and see this film !
if you do not like the message
that it sends ,
then you have issue ,
that need some attention !
