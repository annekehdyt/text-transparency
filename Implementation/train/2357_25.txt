this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx ,
and i bet
it will be my last .
i failed to see
why
he was funny ,
although person in the audience thought
it was very funny
when he made a face to the camera ,
or for saying
`` i am going to take a shower '' .the plot is completely predictable .
the bad guy comes after the good guy .
the good guy has a woman ,
so the bad guy uses her .
in between 
the official screwing up .
the final scene are utterly unbelievable .
you spend 2 year and million of dollar
chasing a guy ,
but you do not do your home work
to solve a trivial riddle ?
there is no great acting ,
there is not much of a plot or storyline ,
and the shooting is done mtv style .
do not waste your money on this one .
