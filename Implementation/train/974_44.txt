i saw this little belgian gem two day
after seeing 'american teen ' .
make no mistake about it ,
adolescence is a roller coaster ride ,
be it american or european .
'naissance de pieuvre '
( or as it is being called in the u.s. 'water lilly ' )
is a tale of a young 15 year old girl
( played by pauline acquart ,
who at time resembles a young scarlett johansson )
acts the cool 
withdrawn girl
who wants to be on the school swim team ,
just to be close to another attractive girl
( adele haenel ) .
it is more than obvious
that marie is more than attracted to floriane .
figuring among all of this is marie 's rather plump 
unattractive friend 
anne ,
who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age .
along the way 
we are shown the usual array of teen pastime
( oken heart 
shop lifting ,
alcohol and/or drug use 
casual sex 
etc . ) .
this is a quiet little film
that takes time
to work it
is way into your system
( michael bay fan 
take note :
the pacing here is s-l-o-w ,
so steer clear ) ,
but
if you have no problem with this ,
water lilly is a charmer .
no rating here ,
but would pull down a hard `` r '' 
due to language 
nudity 
adult situation .
