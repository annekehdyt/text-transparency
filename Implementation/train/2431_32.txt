this early role for barbara shelley
( in fact 
her first in britain
after working in italy ) ,
was made
when she was 24 year old ,
and it is certainly safe to say
that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's `` cat girl . ''
while blonde and unette get most of the attention
( i will always cherish yutte stensgaard ) ,
the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability
( one such example being 1960 's `` village of the damned 
''
in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband 
george sander )
.she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of `` cat person 
'' and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it is difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase ) .her character apparently sleeps in the nude 
and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 year later in 1965 's `` rasputin-the mad monk '' )
.the ravishing gown
she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder
( i do not see what held
that dress up ,
but i would sure like to ) .all in all 
proof positive
that barbara shelley 
in a poorly written role
that would defeat most actress ,
rise above her material
and makes the film consistently watchable 
a real test of star power ,
which she would find soon enough at hammer 's studio in bray 
for the duration of the 1960 's .
