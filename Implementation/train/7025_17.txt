my husband and i enjoy the doodlebop as much as our 8 month old baby does .
we have bought him dvd 's and cd 's just so we can watch and listen to them ourselves .
they are fun 
energetic 
and very entertaining .
they encourage child to be active 
share and care .
they always have a positive message along with fun entertainment .
every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television
and starts bouncing up and down in excitement .
dee dee is a wonderful singer ,
she has a great voice .
moe is a great dancer .
i would recommend the doodlebop to anyone with child .
our favorite song is the bird song .
you just can not help but smile and want to dance
when you hear it .
