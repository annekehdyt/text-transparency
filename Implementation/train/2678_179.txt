***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** continued ... from here on in the whole movie collapse in on itself .
first we meet a rogue program with the indication
we are gon na get ghost and vampire and werewolf and the like .
we get a guy with a retarded accent
talking endless garbage 
two 'ghost '
that serve no real purpose
and have no character what-so-ever and a bunch of henchman .
someone 's told me
they are vampire
( straight out of blade 2 ) ,
but they are so undefined i did not realise.the funny accented guy with a ridiculous name
suffers the same problem as the oracle 
only for far longer and far far worse .
he has a simple point about cause and effect ,
makes it ,
then continues to make it
and make it
until it becomes convoluted and stupid .
his final line
before walking off is comparable to storm 's `` do you know
what happens to a toad ... '' line in x-man in level of utter bland baddness .
the chocolate cake is such a lazy 
pathetic cliche and monica bellucci
as the wife does nothing other
than exactly what we expect the moment
we see her.and
then we get another kung fu fight ! ! !
why ?
neo is 
allegedly 
the one .
he can do anything .
he has the ultimate power
and what does he use it for .
kung bloody fu all the time .
and while he can stop 1000 bullet ,
he still gets cut by a sword
and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchman
( vampire ? ) .
i wanted to see mind blowing power .
i wanted to see him do the wildest 
craziest most insane s*** to person
because he can do anything .
i got the same
as before without the 'wow'.the fabled car chase .
that can not be bad .
well ... no 
it is not .
it is just not what we have been tyold
it was going to be .
all the cool shot from this scene are in the trailer .
every one .
so all possibly wow has been taken from us
so all we now get is a good chase sequence with 
guess what 
a kung fu fight ! ! !
ok 
it is not neo ,
but you would have thought
he had have explained to his closest friend about the reality of the matrix .
at least taught them something .
it is not hard .
`` hey 
morpheus 
do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix .
it is not real .
as long as you understand
that nothing 's real then nothing can really harm you .
`` there you go .
simple.ok 
so the chase is not bad .
it is never boring
and it does not seem like 16 minute .
it is just so underwhelming .
and still ,
it gets worse.the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable .
they have this whole elaborate plan
that involves three crew .
they then only show it sporadically between morpheus 's over long 
super preachy 
monologue .
to make it worse ,
they never clearly define what this plan
that needs 3 teams is .
you know basically ,
but you do not know
who 's doing what 
when ,
so when one crew goes down you just do not care
and you do not know
how this is going to affect what goes on.i will sum it up though ,
it happens so trinity can get back into the matrix to setup the end .
that is the only reason it happens .
which raises the question ,
why did they need to send 6 person originally ?
trinity gets in in five minute by herself ! neo 's journey to the centre of the matrix
( so to speak )
is handled equally lazily .
ooohhh ! ! !
he runs into another 100 agent smith ! ! !
woooooo ! ! !
that must 've taken a lot of thought .
only now they are in a corridor
so the fight has no scale
and is over in a moment .
man 
what a grand finale ! !
! and then the architect ! !
! remember
everything i said
was bad about the oracle and the foreign guy ?
add them together and double it ,
that is how truly appalling the architect is .
the only reasonable potential of him is he is about to set up the cliffhanging climax.and
then he blows
it !
let 's look at the option
he gives neo .
choose one door and all humanity dy
( except 27 ! ! ! ) .
choose the other and all humanity dy ! ! !
considering choice is something this film tries
to explore
it does not really give
it is hero one .
if he had a choice of save humanity and the missus dy or save the missus
and kill humanity there is the potnetial for inner torment and tension .
also 
with trinity being mid fall 
the potential of a real cliffhanger
that would 've made
seeing the third more essential .
but no .
he has save no-one or save the missus.now ,
the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying
and then coming back to life right at the end .
the year
it came out everyone
was so annoyed
by how stupid jar jar was they did not notice
that the very end of the matrix made him look him steven hawking .
`` the oracle told me i would fall in love with the one ,
and i love you '' ... .
come on ! ! ! !
how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible
that was ? so ,
what do the wachowski 's do in the sequel ?
well 
they make the ending of the original look better .
how ?
well ,
by doing almost exactly the same thing again
( only swapping character )
only so much worse i think
my f a and r key would be worn out
if i kept writing far
before i got to worse.and the cliffhanger
is just not really a cliffhanger .
it is a reminder.basically ,
this film is just bad .
i really did not want it to be bad ,
but it is .
bad in just so many way .
and to make matter worse ,
this is not a film with not enough budget .
it is not a film with too short a schedule .
it is not a film
that is been rushed out .
it is not a film
where too much influence has come from the outside .
this is exactly the film the wachowski 's set out to make with warner 's fortune
fully behind them .
and that is what makes this so awful .
at least rancid aluminium can say
that it did not haev enough time or money.matrix reloaded .
the worst film ever made ?
maybe not quite .
the most disappointing and defalting film ever made.undeniably .
