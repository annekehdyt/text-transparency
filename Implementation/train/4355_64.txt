cillian murphy and rachel mcadam star in this action/thriller written and directed by the master of suspense 
wes craven 
himself .
the whole movie starts with some trouble at the lux atlantic 
a hotel in miami .
the problem is all fixed by lisa reisert 
the manager of the hotel .
then she goes to the airport ,
and that is where all of the trouble begins .
she meets jackson rippner ,
who does not like to be called jack
because of the name jack the ripper ,
if you know you him and i mean .
then they board the plane ,
and crazy enough 
rippner and reisert sit next to each other .
for the next half-hour 
lisa is terrorized 
tormented 
and terrified by rippner .
i will not give anything away .
then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport .
then lisa goes to her house
to see
if her father is okay ,
and crazily enough 
rippner is already there .
there is nearly twelve minute of violence and strong intensity throughout
that entire scene .
in total 
about 25 minute of intense action comes at the end.not only was the movie intense
but it had a great plot
to it .
like i said ,
i will not give anything away
because it is so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing/frightening .
and the acting from every single character in the movie 
even the one with no line at all 
were all pitch perfect .
it was incredible .
everything was awesome in this movie !
the acting 
the music 
the effect 
the make-up 
the directing 
the editing 
the writing

wes craven is definitely the master of suspense .

and is definitely worth spending your money on .
