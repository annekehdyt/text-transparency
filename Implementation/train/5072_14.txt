yet another british romantic comedy
which audiences all over the world
seem to have a ravenous appetite for .
this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre -
all the classic clich\u00e9d scene are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstanding
to running
after departing train to declare one 's love .
the character are one-dimensional caricature save for love-hewitt
who manages to ing some cohesion to the film .
thing threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses ;
our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending .
if you are looking for a bridget jone ,
notting hill kind of experience
you will not find it here .
