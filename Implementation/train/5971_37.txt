i have been a hindi movie buff
since the age of 4
but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie 
especially as a hindi film .
in the past several year 
i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movie and reverted
to watching the classic
( teesri kasam 
mere huzoor 
madhumati 
mother india 
sholay 
etc . )
but this movie changed everything .
it is one of the best movie i
have ever seen .
i found
it not only to be moving
but also found it to be very educational for someone
who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america .
it helped me to understand my own family history ,
which was always something very abstract to me .
but 
to `` see '' it ,
feel it
and understand
it helped me to sympathize with the generation before me and the struggle
that indian person endured .
the film helped to put many thing into perspective for me ,
especially considering the current world event .
i never thought
that a movie could change the way
i think
like this before ... it did .
the plot is fantastic ,
the acting superb and the direction is flawless .
two thumbs up !
