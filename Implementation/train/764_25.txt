i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena ,
the curtain and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason .
anyway 
this could have been one of the best summerslam 's ever
if the wwf did not have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna ,
now for it is time
it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man
but i am glad time have changed .
it was a terrible main event
just like every match luger is in is terrible .
other match on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase 
steiner brother vs heavenly body 
shawn michael vs curt hening 
this was the event
where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel 
irs vs 1-2-3 kid 
bret hart first takes on doink
then takes on jerry lawler
and stuff with the hart and lawler was always very interesting ,
then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty ,
undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match ,
the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinker ,
and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring
and it has a terrible ending .
however it deserves 8/10
