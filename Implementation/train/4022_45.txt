i saw this film numerous time in the late 60's/early 70 's whenever
it reared
it is head like a reindeer with rabies every november-december
as a saturday matin\u00e9e kiddie show.it was always stiff competition for the chrstmas
that almost was not ( oops-can i say `` christmas '' ?
) 
perhaps the greatest 
most iconic christmas-season film of all time.but
that is another review.at the time ,
i marveled
that the on-screen tint of santa claus was almost `` pink and white '' ,
so much had the color of the sprocket-torn print
changed color.the film is kinda creepy !
i thought so then
-- and still do 
actually .
i was highly entertained then ,
as i still am !
it is amusing in a `` retarted-elf '' sort of way .
by the way 
the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now
than it did in the theater ,
circa 1969-74.if you are expecting maybe `` the lost rankin-bass christmas special-forget it !
if you want fellini does christmas
-- read on ... by nature 
the dubbing on these foreign film
( the original version here
was in spanish )
always makes them seem `` surreal '' .
this adds to the film inherent oddness .
it is also pretty scary in that a `` mishevious demon ''
( as described in the original us trailer )
spends the entire film
trying to turn decent kid `` evil '' .
one particularly nightmarish scene has a young `` latch-key '' boy wishing
he had parent for christmas-suddenly the `` port-a-family '' emerges out of giant `` christmas presents-of-the-mind ''
until he realizes
he is just daydreaming !
see this 
christmas lover
-- and if you are a stoner ,
save your stash --
this film will make you think
you are hallucinating ...
without drug !
