this movie was amazing ,
it is the kind of movie
where you watch it and rather than look at other movie
by actor you look at other movie by director/ writer .
sandler did a good job
working a character outside of his comfort zone
and the always good cheadle did a great job too .
this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience .
the acting was fantastic
and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film .
this film focuses on the real american 
the past generation 
no stereotype or racism just person
who have come together
and realized the true meaning of life .
this film is about loss and coping .
instead of picking on psychiatry ,
it defines it ,
not as someone
who heals you magically ,
but rather through the necessity
of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone
you can trust
will not judge you ,
but rather will guide you though your thought .
this movie is all round amazing !
