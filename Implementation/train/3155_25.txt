this is a great canadian comedy series .
the movie tell of how the star jean paul tremblay-
( julian )
and the head writer of the show and his buddy rickie and bubble play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer park
and the denizen of said trashy hood .
the movie will tell you
why rickie and julian begin doing their more advanced foray into the world of crime .
why and the reason
behind everything would be a spoiler so i shall
not give the real reason
behind their more illiant escapade .
their friend and oft-time partner
( bubble )
is a illiant character .
the whole show is illiant
and missing the movie will not affect the way
you see the sit-com one bit .
it is a comedy with a capital c and a illiant satire on trailer park living and small time crook with small time idea but big time dream .
if you ever have the opportunity to watch
-- buy --
steal this program grab it .
you will be glad you did .
and to my american friend -- -it will eak you up also .
10 out of 9. brilliant .
tv how tv should be .
