i love the munna bhai mbbs but `` lagge raho ... '' sux really sux .
i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life .
and these high rating really astonished me
that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewer ? ?
**may be spoiler** an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai ,
person discussing their personal prob .
on phone come on man from
which part of the world u r ? ? ?
i agree
that film should be fictitious
but these thing are really indigestible.2/10 .
( 2 star is for 15 min good starting )
