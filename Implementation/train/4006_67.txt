in late 1800s san francisco 
poor well-dressed errol flynn
( as jame j. corbett )
works at a bank ,
and enjoys attending local `` fight ''
( boxing )
with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson
( as walter lowrie ) .
one day 
pretty alexis smith
( as victorium ware )
walks into the `` comstock bank '' ,
where mr. flynn works .
flynn is so taken with ms. smith 's elegant beauty ,
he offers to carry her withdrawal purse .
smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn ,
but is put off by his ashness.flynn 's good deed
( actually 
pick-up attempt )
gets him a complimantary memberhip in the snooty `` olympic club '' ,
which conveniently includes a gymnasium
( with boxing equipmant ) .
however 
flynn 's presumptuous manner 
and practical joking
( he tickles man on the parallel bar )
irritates `` club '' member .
when an english boxing champ visits the club ,
member endeavor to get flynn to fight the man .
they are hopeful flynn
will resign ,
humiliated by his defeat - but 
flynn win !
first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brother 
and director raoul walsh .
mr. buckner was 
certainly 
basking in the success of his contribution
( screenplay )
to the studio 's illiant `` yankee doodle dandy '' .
unfortunately 
this story is positively ludicrous .
there was a `` gentleman jim ''
- this story is supposedly the filming of the real jame j. corbett 's autobiography `` the roar of the crowd '' - but ,
this movie must be significan notly fictionalized.flynn is a very appealing leading man ;
he maneuvers the script lightly ,
and should have been recognized 
by the early 1940s 
as an excellent actor .
many of flynn 's characterization were
( are ? )
overlooked as great performance 
and this is one of them .
smith does well as his feminine interest 
deftly transmitting her emotion for the viewer .
director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant .
the supporting cast is a treasure trove 
from boisterous alan hale
( as pat corbett )
to walk-on lon mccallister
( `` paging mr .
corbett '' ) .
