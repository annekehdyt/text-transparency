the only reason
that this movie is rated a 1
is that zero is not one of the selection option .
with a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup 
horrific acting 
and special effect
that look like they came out of the `` thunderbird '' tv series ,
it is amazing that widmark did not kill the director
for putting this black mark on his resume .
even by 1950 's standard 
the special effect are atrocious ,
except for a couple of underwater submarine sequence .
i can only assume
that it was nominated for best special effect
because 
except for 20,000 league under the sea and them ! 
there was not anybody else doing effect .
it was certainly no contest for disney that year
if this was their only competition .
i would not recommend the film 
even for hard core submarine movie buff ,
as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot
where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up-raised periscope .
there are other 
much better 
sub film
that you can enjoy from this era 
like the aforementioned 20,000 league or torpedo run .
