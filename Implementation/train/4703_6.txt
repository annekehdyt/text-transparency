my short comment for this flick is go pick it up .
chance are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of element superbly explored in this criminal thriller .
there is no way the character of miklos ,
claiming
and pushing for room in every way possible ,
wont push your nerve to the edge ... 2 thumb up !
