as the film begins a narrator warns us
the screaming skull is so terrifying
you might die of fright
-- and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed .
well 
i do not think
any one has died of fright from seeing this film ,
but a few may have died of boredom .
the screaming skull is the sort of movie
that makes ed wood look good.very loosely
based on the famous francis marion crawford story ,
skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman
who marries a sinister man
whose first wife died under mysterious circumstance .
once installed in his home ,
she is tormented by a half-wit gardener 
a badly executed portrait 
peacock ,
and ultimately a skull
that rolls around the room
and causes her to scream a lot .
and to her credit 
actress peggy webber scream rather well.unfortunately 
her ability
to do so
is the high point of the film .
the plot is pretty transparent ,
to say the least ,
and while the cast is actually okay ,
the script is dreadful and the movie
so uninspired you
will be ready to run screaming yourself .
true 
the thing only runs about sixty-eight minute ,
but it all feels a lot longer .
add to this a truly terrible print quality
and there you are.there are film
that are so bad
they are fun to watch .
it is true that the screaming skull has a few howler
-- but the film drags so much i
could not work up more than an occasional giggle ,
and by the time the whole thing is over your head
will roll from ennui .
if it were not for peggy webber 's way with a scream ,
this would be the surefire cure for insomnia .
give it a miss.gft ,
