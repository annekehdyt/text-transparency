i wanted to watch this movie
because of eliza dushku ,
but she only has a smaller part in it ,
and her character is not very likable .
however 
the main character ,
played by melissa sagemiller ,
is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight
to look at throughout the movie .
this is really nothing but a showcase for her look and talent .
she does a very good job.the story itself is 
on the face of it 
pretty nonsensical .
after a car crash 
some friend are possibly dead ,
but keeps on living their previous life ,
while all sort of mysterious thing happen .
some bad guy are after them ,
but we never really find out
who they are
( possibly they were the one in the other car ,
but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are after them ) .
the final scene especially seem filmically ambitious ,
but i can not get anything coherent out of it .
the opening scene ,
where the bad guy
( who wear some strange mask )
cut a blond girl 's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on .
unless the bad guy are supposed to be a representation of the surgeon
who 're trying to pull cassie
( sagemiller )
back from the dead ... but no ,
that does not seem to work .
the bad guy are just bad guy ;
they really just mess up a story
that might otherwise have been interesting .
in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice ,
who the hell needs bad guy ? 3/10 .
