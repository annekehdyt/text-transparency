final score :
0
( out of 10 )
***possible scene specific spoiler
( but who the hell care )
***yes ,
that is right :
zero .
and i rarely give 1 's .
even for the lamest of movie i look for thing like music 
cinematography 
imagination ,
it is humor ,
even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible .
looking at it within it is own genera or subgenera .
but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here .
i can not remember
another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room
when it was over .
the only reason i made it to the end
was
because i could not seem to change the channel - i
sat there simply aghast ,
watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next .
it was like watching a snake digest a rat .
but let 's have some fun and pull this baby apart ,
shall we .
first of all 
there is nothing technical about `` whipped ''
that works .
the visual are all sitcom style .
the cut scenes all just picture of the street traffic
going by at night over and over .
the music and score 
not only does not contribute anything to the movie -
it is obnoxious .
not to mantion it does not have anything to contribute to anyway .
the acting is as cardboard
as it comes ,
all around
and that goes for amanda peet
( clearly the `` star ''
that got this train wreck green-lighted )
too .
these guy ,
supposedly good friend ,
have no more chemistry or sense of purpose
then
if director peter m. cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minute
before shooting.on the creative side ,
there is not an original bone in it is body .
it has no imagination .
it show us nothing
we have not seen a thousand time before .
the whole premise 
or `` twist '' 
of this movie is based on male-bashing and the `` idea ''
that an empowered woman can play man `` just
as they get played '' .
anybody ,
that think
this is somehow a twist or is in any way
original has obviously
never turned on a tv before .
twisted 
shallow woman are common .
male-bashing is the norm .
it is not stealing from anything specifically ,
it is worse :
it is stealing from clich\u00e9s .
i can not imagine a woman
making a movie
that depicted other woman
based so much on stereotype and with this sense of contempt .
makes me want to go rent `` in the company of man '' - or better yet ,
`` there is something about mary '' .
this movie wants to be a `` edgier '' version of `` there is something about mary ''
so bad you can see the sweat .
the movie has no insight into woman 
man 
dating 
sex 
or really anything .
cohen is simply content to regurgitate myth
he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movie .
on the other end 
the movie does not work as a satire either ,
because
even though it is ripe with exaggeration one could view as `` satirical ''
it does not have that grounding in reality
that satires need .
it does not even know what it is satirizing .
then there is the dialogue ,
which is little more then the character screaming obscenity at each other .
example : character 1 :
`` f**k you '' character 2 :
`` oh yeah 
well f**k you ''
( repeat )
and the bottom line 
the thing
that could excuse all the other discretion :
there are a lot of movie
without plot ,
without good acting 
with morally repulsive character and obscenity laced dialogue
that have been funny and thus ,
been good .
`` whipped '' are not funny .
not for a second .
it has no comic skill or timing .
the situation are all completely phony ,
not based in any shred of truth ,
especially enough to wring laugh out of us .
the character all oadly drawn
so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator .
just look at `` the marquee scene '' ,
`` cult classic '' hair gel scene .
one of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet
and see mana
( peet )
's viator .
for some reason light shine down on it
as if he is found the holy grail .
why cohen think
man react this way to viator i do not know .
while he rubs it on himself ,
he drops it in the toilet
and then attempt to fish it out with his bare hand when 
oh my 
mana walk in on him .
oh 
my side .
but strangely enough 
person actually like this movie .
of course 
person also like `` friend '' and reality dating show
so i should not be surprised .
all of this has a common thread however .
`` whipped '' is big evidence
to me
that there is just a huge pocket of person in america
that will laugh at any joke
just because it is about sex .
they will like any show or movie
( or think
they like it )
just because it is about dating or relationship .
it is lack of any quality has no baring on these person .
just as person are indoctrinated to want whiter tooth and thinner body
to sell toothush and weight loss program ,
they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating/relationship related
to sell them cheap 
empty 
effortless tv 
movie and any number of product .
the only consilation will be that
when i die ,
because i saw this movie ,
i have got a credit
to get 80 minute of my life back .
