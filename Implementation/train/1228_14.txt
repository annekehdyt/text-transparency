stilted 
stagy 
strange and opaque ,
if visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy .
really boring 
way too much male nudity
( including father-son incest ) ,
and just a sort of shameless pointlessness .
i will confess 
however ,
that certain passage of dialogue ,
taken on their own term ,
do have a lulling 
haunting quality .
