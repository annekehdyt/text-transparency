if you were to judge based on the movie alone ,
the committee
that gave the stage musical `` a chorus line '' a pulitzer prize ,
and broadway audience
that kept the war horse running for 15 year ,
were all on heavy narcotic 
because one singular sensation this film certainly is not.what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystify me ,
but he makes a musical
that is almost entirely about movement
just sit on the screen like a lump of clay.not content with the original score the way
it was originally written ,
someone decided that what the film really needed was a and new song
to give the movie some zip .
thus we are assaulted with the oscar-nominated
( ! )
`` surprise 
surprise . ''
well surprise 
surprise 
the song stink ,
and so does the movie.grade :
