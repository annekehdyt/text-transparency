i started watching this movie
expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe ...
and i was not far off .
there is a fair amount of glimpsed gore ,
and they threw in lot of nudity ,
but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twist .
holy cow 
they actually put a little thought into the story ,
and did not completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset .
and dare i say it ,
some of the `` gratuitous '' nudity was not so gratuitous after all ,
because it fit in with the story
and setting.do not get me wrong ,
it is still overall a bad movie ,
but as bad movie go ,
it is a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost woman and robot monster .
