i am not a parent ,
neither am i a male .
but i was able to identify with every character 's heartach and pains.this is a movie teenager should watch .
maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again .
i am sorry for those
that do not understand the value of love ,
family and friendhip.it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing .
and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck
giving his best in a moving and sincere performance .
he showed at an early age ,
that he is capable of heartfelt drama .
he should be offered more serious role .
note hollywoodland ... his first serious role in year
and he went out
and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006.this movie can be appreciated by person of all age .
maybe should not be watched by child under 10
because they might get scared
that the same may happen to their family ,
but i recommend it to the entire family.i bought this movie on dvd
and have watched it with friend many time .
because it portrays the value
that are important in life .
