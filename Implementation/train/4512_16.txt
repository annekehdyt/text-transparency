elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law
and order ada 's and her acting is even worse here .
her attempt at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic .
nor can she adequately summon the intense emotion needed
to play the mother of a kidnapped child ;
at time
while her daughter is missing
she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed ,
as if she can not remember
where she left her keys.this is an important true story ,
so it is too bad
that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message .
the rest of the cast is talented enough ,
but they just can not overcome rohm 's tendency
to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl
whenever actual acting is required .
