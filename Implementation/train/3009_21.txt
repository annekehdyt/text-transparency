the film had many fundamental value of family and love .
it expressed human emotion
and was an inspiring story .
the script was clear
( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for child )
and was enjoyable and humorous at time .
there were a few charged symbol
to look for .
the cinematography was acceptable .
there was no sense of experimentation
that a lot of cinematographer have been doing today
( which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out ) .
it was plainly filmed
but had a nice soft quality to it .
although editing could have been done better
i thought
it was a nice movie for a family
to enjoy .
and the organization of information was just thrown at you
which was something
i did not like either but in all it was a good movie .
