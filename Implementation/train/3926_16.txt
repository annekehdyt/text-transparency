i bought this movie from gamestop 's discount used movie bin
and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably
so i bought it for 99cents .
the movie itself is retarded
and they use like ten different monkey throughout the whole film
that hardly look alike .
not to mention they use a stunt double
who is just a short guy in costume
making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey.the director
more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzee after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros. film
and he ended up owing money to the studio .
it also does not help
that he was not even infamous for the terrible job
he did ,
he was not even known for producing a poop-chute film.why
was this movie ever made ?
