being the only movie i was able to see at this year 's `` nordische filmtage '' at l\u00fcbeck ,
this year 's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.this movie ,
which was announced as an erotic thriller ,
is nothing more than a sick piece of crap !
excuse the language ,
but there are not any decent word to describe it.first of all ,
the actor are not the best .
but even better actor would not have rescued the movie .
e.g .
the plot :
after the first 15 minute it was quite clear
that john was sick ,
the neighbour girl were not real
and that he killed his first girlfriend .
the so called `` sex-scene '' was nothing else but disgusting
( hitting each other until blood flow for me
has not anything to do with sexuality ) ,
but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting image to be shown .
everything else was copied by other director like e.g .
lynch 
but of course without their geniality.so ,
to summarize the whole film
and to save other viewer time and money :
guy loses girlfriend ,
girlfriend turns back home ,
guy kill girlfriend
and becomes mad afterward ,
guy imagine hot ,
but crazy neighbour girl 
guy has very disgusting sex with one of them
( or so he thinks ) ,
in the end he realizes 
he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time ... bad story 
bad actor 
picture 
that make you want to vomit ... 1/10
( 1 point for the fact ,
that you realize
how good you can understand norwegian
if you learned swedish - at least one benefit of the evening -
and you can not choose 0 point here ) .
