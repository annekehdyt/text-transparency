just got my copy of this dvd two disc set
and while not perfect ,
i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time .
i have to say right up front
that i am a huge fan of zombie movie ,
and i truly think
that the fine person
who made these film
must be too .
i also have a soft spot for person
who are trying 
sometimes against all odd 
to live a dream .
and again 
these person are doing it .
is this some award-winning collection of amazing film ?
no .
not even close .
but for what they do on their meager budget ,
these film should be recommended .
for me 
the bottom line is always ,
was i entertained ?
did i have a good time with this movie ?
and here the answer to both was `` yes . ''
the first in the series is also the most raw .
it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility
and person melt down or something .
cut to some year later
and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site .
some kid making a video fall into a hole
and find themselves trapped in the bottom level of the facility .
they get rescued ,
but the hole is not sealed and the person from the opening start lumbering out of the hole .
soon 
the whole town is overtaken by the undead .
and these zombie are fun .
they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever ,
but they are fun .
the whole movie culminate in a showdown between the final survivor of the area and the undead 
with our hero going into the reactor 's lower level
to take out the flesh eating zombie
and seal the hole forever !
pretty cheesy ,
but i think
it was meant to be .
still ,
it moves very fast ,
has bucket of gruesome effect
and really try to have some style .
the acting is uneven ,
but a few good performance shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track .
i went back
and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trial
and fun
that the crew and cast experienced on the movie .
director todd sheet seems pretty proud of this 
his first film ,
but also has no delusion .
he knows
it is a trashy zombie movie ,
but he does show respect to person involved .
also 
sheet has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity
that other could learn from in the movie field .
the behind the scene of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well .
i felt
it was almost as entertaining as the film
it was made for .
there are some great interview
and behind the scene footage ,
mixed with news story about the film from some major place like cnn 
fox and mtv .
over all 
a fun little film
that is very rough around the edge ,
but still had me laughing
and enjoying the ride !
i have seen many dv film ,
and some shot of video film ,
and many are quite dull ,
but this one really was not .
while newer dv film are technically superior ,
they just are not fun !
overall 
this is a solid 
if a bit flawed 
release with plenty of extra and ton of gore and splatter .
while not eaking any grand rule of move making ,
i found the series to be fun
and always a laugh ,
so i give this set a solid recommendation .
todd sheet was not trying to make award winning art here folk ,
he was trying ,
sometimes against all odd it seems ,
to make fun zero budget 
splattery horror and to that end ,
he has succeeded in spade .
