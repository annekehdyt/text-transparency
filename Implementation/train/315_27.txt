this film is not morbid ,
nor is it depressing .
it -is- sad ,
because aid in the early '90s -was- sad .
but its real message is one of love and perseverance.mark and tom were in a long-term 
loving relationship .
their devotion to each other is evident right away ,
and as the ravage of aid escalate and become the focal point of their life ,
you see strength and commitment
that are truly heartwarming.when `` silverlake life ''
was originally released ,
i was deeply involved in hiv/aid education and health care 
volunteering as a counselor at an hiv/aid clinic .
the film spoke to me like no other aid film of its day could ,
because mark and tom were real person ,
living the very experiences
that i saw on a daily basis in real life .
i knew from firsthand experience
what it was like to watch aid eat away at formerly viant 
young 
healthy person ;
seeing
it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friend deteriorate .
it touched me in a way
that 
even all these year later 
still affects me .
