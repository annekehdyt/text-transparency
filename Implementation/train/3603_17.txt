scarecrow seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film .
a group of thug pull off a paramilitary-like robbery of the payroll at camp pendleton in california .
they high-jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demand to be flown to mexico .
along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield
monitored by strange
looking scarecrow .
these are not just any run-of-the-mill scarecrow ...
they can kill .
the acting is no better than the horrible dialog .
and the attempt at humor are not funny .
very low budget and shot entirely in the dark.the cast includes :
ted vernon 
michael david simms 
kristina sanborn 
b.j .
turner 
phil zenderland and victoria christian .
