i am not one of those person
who just go online
after i see a movie
and decide to call it the worst movie ever made .
if you doubt me ,
please look at my other review .
however 
for the first time ever 
i have seen a movie so horrible
that i wanted to write about how bad it was
before it was even over.i love bad movie .
to me 
ed wood is a genius ,
i thought bloody murder 
jeeper creeper and most horrible horror movie were good .
however 
there is not a single good thing
i can say
about this film.the plot is basically non existent .
if someone reading my review wastes their money
to see it ,
they can discern for themselves what the plot might be ,
but i advise you
that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.the special effect
are bad.the acting is bad.the two lead are attractive ,
but that is all there is.i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone 
but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking @ yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie
before they waste a dime on it .
i will tell you anything.i love bad movie 
and i love horror and i love new inventive movie .
i even love horror porn stuff like hostel
( which some reviewer claimed this was like ,
but obviously they only thought
so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 ) .
but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made.and
before you disregard this review ,
this is coming from someone
who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead ,
but actually bought a copy of it .
