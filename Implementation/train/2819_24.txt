this movie was ,
as homer simpson would have put it 
`` more boring than church . ''
maybe i do not understand it well enough ,
and i thought
it started out pretty well ,
but
after
( start of spoiler )
hermann braun is sent to jail and maria start working/sleeping with her boss
it just started to drag ,
and i struggled to keep awake .
again 
maybe it symbolizes something ,
but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place .
( end of spoiler ) .
in the end 
i fail to see
why other think
it is so great ,
as i found it extremely boring .
by the way 
i did not watch this movie by my own free will ,
as i was required to see it for a film class .
