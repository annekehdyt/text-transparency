how did this become a blockbuster ?
dear god i do not know
where to start why this movie sucked too much .
the movie was predictable
and there was no originality .
the only thing i can admire is the acting of some character .
the movie was too ight ,
they should have done something with the lighting 
eg .
making the environment more darker .
the make up on certain dead character
made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick .
this is 2006 !
person do not get scared by other person
wearing heavy make up .
most of the horror scene we are taken from other hollywood or asian horror movie .
total rip off !
this is why i do not watch tagalog movie .
the only reason why so many person `` screamed ''
while watching this movie
is because of conformity .
how many time do we have to copy scene from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv ,
its now coming from the window next door ?
no matter how you put it ,
its still a rip off .
if you want a good horror movie ,
