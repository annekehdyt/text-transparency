i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talent as an actor .
i therefor found it strange
that she would appear in a film
that so distorted that fact .
her character 's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton ,
alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft .
the trip had been turned down by the us airforce 
navy and coast guard as beyond their capability .
the same company staged a similar rescue a few year later
to ing out a man from the south pole base .
i feel
that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman
facing a frightening task .
i fail to see
why the producer would find
it necessary ignore the avery of the rescue pilot
and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercule .
