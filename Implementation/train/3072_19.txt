first of all ... ..what the hell ?
why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing 
offensive sick garbage
that any normal real human
being with a soul
could not watch .
what the crap is funny about a dog
being injured ,
a grandma getting her head knocked off ... a guy
getting his hand blown to piece
and two girl going to the bathroom ?
what in the hell has this world come
to that person find comedy in some thing so completely sick .
anyone
who thinks this kind of material is funny ,
should not even be allowed to walk the earth .
but from what i hear its not even offensive ...
so ... they promise comedy through demented pile of sick garbage ...
and they can not even pull that off .
