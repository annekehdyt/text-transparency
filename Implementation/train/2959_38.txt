with the runaway success of `` god 's army '' 
every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now .
in the case of the recent `` the other side of heaven '' 
this was not at all a bad thing .
that film ,
while not great ,
was quite good .
`` the single ward '' 
however 
is not.telling the story of a young ,
divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life 
the writing and shooting style of `` the single ward '' is 
in many way 
very similar to the 80s comedy `` ferris bueller 's day off '' .
however 
the similarity end there .
while `` ferris bueller '' was funny 
original 
and well-acted
( as far as stupid comedy like this ever are ) ,
`` the single ward '' is completely the opposite .
it tries very hard to be funny .
however 
90 % of the gag either fall flat or are clich and joke you have probably heard a million time before .
the other 10 % seem to be thrown in to fill out the time .
and the acting ,
while not awful ,
is amaturish at best.in addition ,
if you are not either a mormon yourself ,
or very 
very familiar with mormon culture 
you will not get hardly anything at all .
whereas `` god 's army '' and `` the other side of heaven '' were appealing to a oad range of viewer 
both inside and outside of the mormon church ,
this film is most definitely one big inside joke ,
and
even if you get it ,
it is just not that funny .
