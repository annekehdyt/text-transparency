spinal tap was funny
because if you knew a little about heavy metal ,
you saw in-joke all over the place .
if you know anything about porn ,
this mock documentary will leave you cold .
everything in it rings false.spinal tap was funny
because it took a familiar world
and pushed it over the top .
this film is decidedly not funny
because it paints a picture of how porn is made
that bears no relationship to the real world.the acting here is uniformly awful ,
but that would not matter much
if the core idea of the movie were good .
but it is not .
