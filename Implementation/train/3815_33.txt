finally we get a tv series
where we get to see the acting talent !
episode one was excellent !
the script gave us a little more than usual 
yeah ,
there was still the `` i am not your father -i
am your father
and omigod you cheated on me ! ''
rubbish but the script allowed the actor to actually feel
and live those real moment
rather than show us
what it would feel
like if -like so many tv soap do .
the camera work also gave us a little more than usual ,
there were no boring shot of repeated angle for hour
yet there was no unnecessary 'shot inside shot or hand-held camera crap '
to add an `` artistic '' edge
it gave us what we needed to see
and also some beautiful scenery picture as well !
nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic
they were real person in a real place dealing with real situation ,
the show lacked nothing in drama
and was completely relevant .
it was such a relief
to be exposed to real acting and so nice
to let our country see just how talented our actor can be when given a real script 
a real opportunity !
thank you tony tilse
