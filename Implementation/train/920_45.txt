der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film -
but still is an interesting film
dealing with suicide
and it is reason and ramification .
those
looking for a gore-fest ,
or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik film or schramm will probably be disappointed .
der todesking is definitely an `` art-house '' style film ,
so those
that need linear ,
explainable narrative need not apply ...
the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an `` episode '' for each day of the week
that revolves around a strange chain letter
that apparently causes person to commit suicide ,
interspersed with scene of a slowly decomposing corpse ...
there are some very well done
and thought provoking scene ,
including the man
talking about the `` problem '' with his wife 
and the concert massacre
( which unfortunately lost some of it is `` power '' on me ,
because i was too busy laughing at the scorpion look-alike band on stage ... ) .
but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful
( the scene
that shows different angle of that huge idge is particularly effective -
especially if you understand the significance of the scene ,
and that the name shown are of person
that actually committed suicide from jumping from the idge ... ) ,
sometimes confusing 
sometimes silly
( the she wolf of the ss rip-off is pretty amusing ) 
sometimes harrowing
( i found the scene of the guy
talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective )
film
that is more of an `` experience ''
then just entertainment ,
as many of these `` art '' film are meant to be .
still 
i did not find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm ,
and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in term of my personally `` enjoyment level '' .
definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or `` art '' film fan .
if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film
that i have seen .
7/10 for der todesking
