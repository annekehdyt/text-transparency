... just look at the poor robert webber character
( great performance ,
once again ! )
who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorist .
everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong .
the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort
to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980y
( the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic 
ironic and therefore timeless die hard ) .
the story comes through as a failed attempt
to glorify the sas commandos .
idea like when a commando shouts \u0084heads down '' all good guy do it
and all bad guy do not so
that they can blast away ad lib
( with a good conscience ) ,
that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos
although he wears the same clothe
and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely
and make it hard to take the movie seriously .
and it just happens
that it tries to be more than just fun .
do not talk about the toilet-mirror-signal episode ... i do not mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoer and the argument between the peace fanatic and the settled 
even headed representative of power in this movie .
but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired .
this is insofar regrettable
as the movie features an early performance of judy davy .
she plays the main fanatic
and seems to have done extensive study on the \u0084subject '' .
anyway 
her performance is a notch above
that of the other and somehow i feel the movie let her down .
