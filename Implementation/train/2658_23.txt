deceptive advertising ... i saw a commercial for carlitos way :
rise to power
that states `` from the producer of scarface and carlito 's way ''
lets get it straight ...
michael bergman did not produce scarface ,
in fact he was 'editing room assistant ' for scarface .
not to take away from bergman 's talent ...
but in my opinion he should of had a little more class .
i think
i can speak for the mass
when i say
... we hate being blatantly lied to .
as far as the movie goes ,
it was poor at best .
i did think
puff daddy did a good job .
although 
luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film .
overall this film did not do a good job
filling in the blank for carlito 's way .
it is obvious
this project was an attempt
to make a quick buck rather a good film .
