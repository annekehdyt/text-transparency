i really enjoyed the detail
that went into the script.jonathan rhys myer
( misspelled )
and jewel were outstanding in their support role .
as was jeffery wright .
toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job
as ever depicted ,
when he had to amputate his best friend 's arm ,
knowing
he would die
without the procedure .
attention to detail 
with good dialect coaching
to catch the southern accent incredibly well.why this movie
was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoter i can only imagine .
i have strong suspicion .
which makes it all the more appealing to me .
i have given a dozen dvd copy out for presents.completely overlooked movie .
rent or buy it
and give it your full attention for a couple of hour 
then judge .
