some person have stated
that as of the 11th season 
south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs ;
but this could not be further from the truth.while this episode does
spoof the living dead series ,
there is more .
it is a satire of how person treat the homeless .
character say
thing like `` they are pretending to be just like us ''
or `` they want to be human . ''
this episode attacks a culture of person
who ignore the lower class
who are often just down on their luck.so yes ,
it is still a satire ,
and also a wonderful spoof .
what more could you want ?
