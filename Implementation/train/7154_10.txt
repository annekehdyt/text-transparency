my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video .
although it had great actors/actress ,
there were just too many subplot going on to retain interest .
plus it just
was not that interesting .
dialogue was stiff and confusing
and the story just flipped around too much to be believable .
i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn 's last movie .
i will always love john ritter best in slapstick .
he was just too pathetic here .
