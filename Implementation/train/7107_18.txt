the concept
of having laurel and hardy this time in the role of chimney sweeper works out surprisingly hilarious .
it guarantees some funny situation and silly antic 
from especially stan laurel of course
as usual.the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor
who is working on a rejuvenation formula .
it does not really sound like a logical mix of story line and incoherent
but both plot line blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending .
it is still a bit weird
but its funny nevertheless ,
so it works for the movie.the
supporting cast of the movie is surprising good .
sam adam is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top
as the nutty professor.the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequence ,
which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thank to the way
they are all executed .
it all helps to make `` dirty work ''
to be one of the better laurel and hardy shorts.8/10
