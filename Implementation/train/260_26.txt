this film has little to recommend it ,
though that little being the eathtaking scenery 
cinematography and direction of wildlife ,
it is difficult to ing up its weak point in the company of such rave review .
it is precisely these thing 
however ,
that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing .
i watched this with my child
and none of us was too impressed by the end .
yes 
the picture were great 
the oad landscapes across the forest and mountain magnificent ,
but what was going on in the foreground ?
the rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl
who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife -
and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing .
it is certainly not a new story ,
in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way
it is told ,
and we have all seen this before ,
and 
indeed 
much more eloquently by antoine de saint-exup\u00e9ry.the only thing really to be gleaned from this film
is a sense
of how to work with these wonderful lens and forest lighting ;
the rest is a waste of time .
