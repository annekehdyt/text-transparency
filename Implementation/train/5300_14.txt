all of those
who voted less than 5
are obviously not fan of clean 
tongue-in-cheek humor .
keaton is illiant in this - as in most of his work .
this is not a blockbuster 
bigger-than-life affair .
this is campy ,
slapstick humor played out by some of hollywood 's best
( and very versatile ) actor .
piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee ,
once.if you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed ,
you got ta see dimitri do his piece
as morone.i gave it a 7 .
