the story of a drifter 
his sheep ranch boss 
and the boss 's daughter is not for all taste ,
but it is still very intriguing .
it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand ,
amongst the scenery
we have come to know so well
through other film from this region.this movie was the first time i
had ever seen the excellent mary regan ,
and i have been a fan of her ever since .
the cast also contains bruno lawrence ,
who is probably best remembered by american audience from the film `` smash palace '' .
terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner
who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter
( regan ) .
sharply acted 
with unforgettably shattering performance from all of its lead .
i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america ,
but believe you me ,
the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .
