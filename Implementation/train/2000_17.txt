i heard about this film
and knew
it was not real good .
but i started watching the film
( on my film-channel )
and was interested .
this could be a really great 
darkly black satire on today moral in medium .
the small featurette on every contestent were good .
it build up to something i
would not wan na miss .
but when the so called show starts everything become implausible 
cheap and rather silly .
here is where the writer should have added something
that would make person think .
but instead it is wrapped up
and assuming person are this dumb.the ending is so bad i give it a 1. even if the film starts of promising .
