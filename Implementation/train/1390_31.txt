i laughed all the way through this rotten movie .
it is so unbelievable .
a woman leaves her husband after many year of marriage ,
has a eakdown in front of a real estate office .
what happens ?
the office manager comes outside
and offers her a job ! ! !
hilarious !
next thing
you know
the two woman are going at it .
yep 
they are lesbian !
nothing ring true in this `` lifetime for woman with nothing better to do '' movie .
clunky dialogue like `` i do not want to spend the rest of my life
feeling like i had a chance
to be happy
and did not take it '' does not help .
there is a wealthy 
distant mother
who disapproves of her daughter 's new relationship .
a sassy black maid - unbelievable
that in the year 2003 
a film gets made
in which there is a sassy black maid .
hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave .
the woman has a husband
who freaks out
and wants custody of the snotty teenage kid .
sheesh !
no cliche is left unturned .
