i agree with everyone
who says
that this series was the best of the 'spy ' genre .
my husband and i were captivated by it
when it first aired in the us
and watched every episode .
i tried at that time
to purchase the series
( i did tape all of it )
but was told by wgbh
that it was not available .
i even considered writing to ian holm to see
if he might have a copy !
like other 
i purchased and read the deighton series
( in part to understand the complicated plot . )
if the original version ever comes available on dvd ,
i will be among the first in line
to snap up a copy .
ian holm 's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing .
( he is always amazing . )
