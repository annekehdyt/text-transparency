i will be short ...
this film is an embarrassment
to everyone except its cinematographer .
the very fact
that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid
until we are `` treated '' to a lingering dance scene .
the plot is ridiculous no one
except the most ardent fan of bad horror will get anything out of it .
and for the love of god please stop saying
this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment
because it is quite clearly not
( childish fumbling lesbian 
what the hell ? ) .
this was by far the worst film at the edinburgh festival
( that i saw anyway ) ,
someone even collapsed halfway through the film
probably because they could not take any more of it .
this may seem like an overly critical rant
but i genuinely can not find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps
if you take it as pure comedy .
in short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class a drug .
