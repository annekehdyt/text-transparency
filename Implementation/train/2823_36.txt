saw a screener of this before last year 's award season ,
did not really know
why they gave them out
after the voting had ended ,
but whatever 
maybe for exposure 
at the least 
but the movie was a convoluted mess .
sure 
some part were funny in a black humor kind of way ,
but none of the character felt very real to me at all .
there was not one person
that i could connect with ,
and i think
that is where it failed for me .
sure 
the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive toward scientology 
wow !
what a grand idea ... let 's see
if that already has not been mined to the point of futility .
the whole ordeal feel fake 
from the lighting 
the casting 
the screenplay to the horrible visual effect
( which is supposed to be intentional ,
i can tell ,
and so can everyone else ,
no one is laughing with you though ) .
anyway 
i hope
it makes it out for sale on dvd at least ,
i would not want a project
that a lot of person obviously put a lot of effort
into get completely unnoticed .
but it is tripe either way .
boring tripe at that .
