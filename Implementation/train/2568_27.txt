while some performance were good-victoria rowell 
adrienne barbeau ,
and the two italian girlfriend come to mind-the story was lame and derivative ,
the emphasis on the girlfriend 's racial background was handled clumsily at best ,
and the relative were mostly portrayed as stereotype 
not as real person .
i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moment
that were supposed to be funny .
i can hardly comprehend
why the local paper here in sf said
this was a good movie ,
and wonder
who posted the glowing review here on imdb .
very disappointed in this movie ,
and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it ,
based on the faulty connection to garden state ,
which is a far funnier 
more inventive 
and touching movie than this one .
i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church ,
which was so wooden and by-the-number
that i nearly left ,
and some in the audience actually did .
that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard ,
which i saw coming 10 minute
before it happened .
i really do not like being misled to spend my money so uselessly .
