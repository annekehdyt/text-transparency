i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope
they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it
before it comes out aug 3rd .
it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as 'hot ' rod kimble .
he is plays a teenager in a small town
who wants to be a stunt man like his late father .
when we meet him ,
he is jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped 
yes 
a mo-ped ,
and almost makes it .
this would be worthy of a 'jackass ' movie
if he was not honestly trying to do this .
isla fisher plays the slightly older
and much more mature girl-next-door 
denise .
she seems to like rod enough
to join his 'crew ' .
jorma taccone
( also snl )
plays his half other 
kevin ,
who document the stunt with a camcorder .
sissy spacek plays rod 's mom 
marie .
she remarried frank powell ,
played by ian mcshane .
frank 's a real tough guy
who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out awls .
it is clear that rod 's not going to earn frank 's respect till
he can beat him .
we find out frank needs a $ 50,000 .
heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money
just so he 'can beat his ass ' once he is healed ,
and prove himself a man .
a long fall down a mountain side convince rod to 'go big ' on one stunt .
rod sets out to get seed money
by charging for doing stunt
that would make you cringe
if you saw them in real life .
like the human torch- at a child 's birthday party .
there were those at the showing
who managed to laugh at most of the stunt .
just when all hope and money is lost ,
along comes a sponsor
who saves the day
by getting the 15 school bus rod wants to jump .
he gets exclusive oadcast right and sets up phone line
to get donation .
rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle .
the whole town turns out and the world tunes in .
does he make the jump ?
does he get the girl ?
do they raise the $ 50k ?
does frank get his ass beat by rod ?
wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video
to find out .
