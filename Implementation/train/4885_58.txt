due to the invention of a `` the domestication collar '' ,
flesh-eating zombie are ought under control ,
and become productive member of society ; however 
they perform menial task .
the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s-styled small town ,
while untamed zombie roam around in `` the wild zone '' .
in the town of `` willard '' 
pre-teen k'sun ray
( as timmy robinson )
lives with parent carrie-anne moss and dylan baker
( as helen and bill robinson ) .
ala 
the robinson are the only family on their street
who do not own a zombie ;
their new neighbor 
the bottom 
have six .
so ,
to keep up ,
the robinson obtain zombie billy connolly
( as fido )
.unfortunately 
mr. connolly 's `` domestication collar '' is damaged by an old lady 's walker ,
and he eats her ;
then 
new and hungry zombie infest the town .
meanwhile 
young ray has grown attached to connolly
( the boy and his zombie are like tv 's `` timmy and lassie '' )
and 
the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling `` zomcom '' authority .
`` fido '' does not go far enough into its own intriguing `` wild zone '' ;
but 
it is a colorful 
stylish 
and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore .
ray and the cast perform well 
individually ; with nubile zombie sonja bennett
( as tammy )
and owner tim blake nelson
( as theopolis )
the most memorable pair .
director andrew currie and crew ,
including rob gray
( design ) ,
jan kiesser
( photography ) ,
don macdonald
( music ) ,
and jame willcock
( design ) ,
deservedly won award .
