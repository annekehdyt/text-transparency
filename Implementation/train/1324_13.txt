i am sorry to say
that this film is indeed bad .
it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference :
no porn.the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul .
maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable .
at the very least 
the pacing should have been picked up.while i accept
that this had a low budget
and the director did a good job visually
given what little resource he had ,
he should have spent more time on the story or better yet ,
get someone else to write it .
many of the action scene were just pointless.it was a complete waste of my time .
