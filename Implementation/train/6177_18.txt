i will not go into too much detail about the plot of this movie
as other reviewer have covered pretty much the same ground.just wanted
to say
that i really enjoyed the film very much .
peter falk 's performance alone is reason enough
to watch the film.a small scale 'road trip ' movie with falk and paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film.very
well written with an adult target audience in mind .
plenty of reality
based humor and some well played drama give the film a feeling
that it could be your own family.really
can not say enough about this film
except
that it is a damn shame
that a lovely movie like this does not get more exposure
while other trashy junk out there does.it is great to see falk with a big leading man role again
and he makes the most of it .
it proves
that his famous friend and writer/director john casavette was right in casting falk in many of his ground eaking film of the 60s and 70s .
