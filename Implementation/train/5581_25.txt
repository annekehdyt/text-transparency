reign over me
( titled after the who song )
is a movie
that is sure to ing a tear
to almost everyone 's eye .
it was a moving story of a guy

he runs into an old college roommate
( cheadle )
that he does not even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress
ensued by the loss of his family .
the two rekindle their old friendship and cheadle 's character 
johnson 
realizes
that he must get sandler 's character 
fineman ,
some help
before it is too late.this
was the first movie
that has made me cry in a long time .
it is completely worth watching
and after seeing it ,
i am positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more .
