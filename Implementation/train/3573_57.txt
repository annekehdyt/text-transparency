probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet .
not surprising ,
since king himself wrote the screenplay .
the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house .
one of the other resident is jud 
a pleasant old man
who knows a few thing about the area .
one is the highway
that runs right through their frontyard .
the other is a path leading to the pet sematary ,
where child for decade have buried the animal killed by the highway .
soon enough 
ellie creed 's cat 
church 
is found dead .
luckily 
this happens
while the family 
with the exception of loui
( the father ) ,
is away for thanksgiving .
jud takes loui to another burial ground 
beyond the pet sematary ,
where church is to be buried .
later 
loui is greeted
( not so politely )
by church .
he is returned ,
appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag
he had been buried in .
maybe he was buried alive .
maybe not .
nothing more i can say
without ruining the story.of all the king adaption i have seen
this would be the most terrifying .
the character are real
and the situation are normal .
mary lambert does a great job
directing the proceedings .
suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film 
due in part to the plot development .
the scene
where gage is killed
will stick in your mind forever .
then 
of course 
we have the conclusion .
easy to determine what is going to happen ,
but lambert pull off some genuinely scary ,
and sometimes disturbing 
moments.overall 
this is a good film and an excellent adaption .
if you enjoy being scared
and do not mind
being haunted by some occasionally disturbing image then `` pet sematary '' is just what you are looking for .
non horror fan will want to avoid this .
