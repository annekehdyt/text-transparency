i saw this film at its new york 's high fall film festival screening
as well and i must say
that i found it a complete and awful bore .
although it was funny in some place ,
the only real laugh was that there appeared to be o real plot
to talk about and the acting in some place was dreadful and wooden 
especially the `` lovely lady '' and the voice of the narrator
( whom i have never heard of )
had a lot
to be desired .
j.c.mac was 
i felt 
the redeeming feature of this film 
true action and grit
and ( out of the cast )
the only real acting .
i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing ,
this could have been a half decent film .
let us just hope
that it is not sent out on general release ,
or if you really want a copy ,
look in the bargain bin in lidl .
