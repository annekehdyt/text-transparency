i remember
watching this film back in 86 '
when it first came out
and what an awful film .
the acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy
it would or is that should have blew away in a eath of wind .
i think
it put me to sleep on more than one occasion and i
was not tired
that i remember .
please avoid at all cost better still have all your tooth taken out with no anaesthetic cos
that would be more entertaining .
it is just a pity i could not give it a zero or a negative score .
i wish
i had not wasted my money
getting this one from the video shop
all i can say
was
that the tape
it was on
was still and new practically hardly surprising
as the film was so poor .
if i remember right i sat
and watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with and the fact
she was sat next
to me was still not enough
to keep me awake
that how bad this film was .
