i have barely just made it through one episode
( `` crouch end '' ) .
the dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy .
the acting was tragic .
eion bailey ,
despite his best attempt
to be dramatic ,
remains mostly expressionless .
his eyeow hint at a recent botox treatment .
claire forlani could have just
as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie .
the character were cartoon ,
each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random 
meandering plot .
cheesy special effect can be excused given the tv miniseries budget .
but attempt to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography
added to the unwatchability .
i get the feeling
that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising ,
but it was lame
and had little to do with the rest of the story .
if i had to compare
it is overall quality to something else ,
i would put this episode of `` nightmare and dreamscape '' on par with the nbc 's hercule .
