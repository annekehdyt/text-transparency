this is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama .
it is not really a horror flick so those
looking for something
like the ring or the grudge will be disappointed .
what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made
to be internally consistent .
i also appreciated the absence of dr. phil psychobabble or new age revisionism .
rather than advancing an agenda ,
the filmmaker just told the story ,
told it well
and let the viewer think about it .
the sparse dreamscape were reminiscent of wyeth painting and amazingly effective .
a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget ,
without big studio ,
star actor 
big-name director
( this was far better than many of hitchcock 's film ) ,
special effect or `` clever '' plot twist .
