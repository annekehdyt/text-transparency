one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain .
mark gatiss 
reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actor and performer
who seem at home with drama
as they are with comedy .
ably
supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson ,
they have persond the series with the most memorable character of recent year .
little britain pale into insignificance as a poor imitation of their idea .
consistently original and groundeaking i am sure
that as many person hate these series as love them but i am equally
as sure that no one could have no opinion on log .
i have yet to see the feature length movie
but i have heard good thing and bad thing
so i will reserve judgement.the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became .
i do not know
whether the tv series made it to the us
but i would be fascinated
to see
how american audience found the weird englishness of the humour
