jane eyre has always been my favorite novel !
when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90 's i was ecstatic !
this is the best and most complete version of the book on film !
this version is a little long
to sit through in one sitting
but well worth it .
timothy dalton is amazing as rochester .
i was glad
that they cast a normal looking actress
( zelah clark )
as jane and not a glamorous person .
i love the set and the location .
for anyone
who is a true jane eyre fan ,
this is the version to watch ! ! !
for those of you
who are interested ,
i just found this version on dvd .
i have watched my vhs copy almost to eaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd .
