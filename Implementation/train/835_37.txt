i want c\u00e9line and jessie go further in their relationship ,
i want to tell them
that they were made for each other ,
that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other .
their story is what we ever wanted
and probably most of us never reached .
this is about love but not stupid thing like in `` notting hill '' or those kind of movie .
this is life
and i did believe in them ,
i did believe
they were falling ...
this was so clever and touching .
i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there ... i want to go to vienna .
i want to see them as soon
as possible again.i have to say
i was now becoming misanthropist
and felt like if love was just a fake 
a concept ,
but with this movie i realized
that maybe somewhere 
somehow and some when 
something could really happen.i am french
and did not know very well july delpy
despite kieslowski `` three color :
white '' ... now i have to see her other works
because she looks like an angel
and got a perfect acting.i
saw `` before sunset ''
( the sequel in paris )
a few day before i saw `` before sunrise ''
and their is no matter .
they are both masterpiece .
proof
that you do not need to impress the eye with technology
to get pure feeling .
i am sorry for my english
which i m trying to best.franck in france
