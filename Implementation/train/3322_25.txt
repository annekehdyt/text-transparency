first 
it takes a full half hour
to get hackman out of jail
and to start doing the job .
what a waste of time ,
we all know
hackman is getting out to do some job for his master ,
why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequence .
then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere ,
simply proving to us
that hackman is under close watch and anything
he says
or does is know by the master .
again 
another 20 minute .
then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife .
all of this should have taken 10-15 minute at most simply as a set-up for the real action 
intrigue and plot twist .
by the time
the real action gets going ,
i was so bored
that i just wanted the movie to end .
hackman is great as usual ,
and the other actor as well ,
but this is a dud of the first magnitude .
