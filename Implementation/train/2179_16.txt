guy walking around
without motive ... i will never get those two hour of my life back .
the guy kept on assuming identity and cheating on his pregnant wife .
what was i thinking ?
how did this win a price anywhere ?
i understood he loved his father but other
than that the movie was completely senseless to me .
what was the purpose of walking so much
and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason .
how did this enrich his life ? ? ?
why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear ? ? ? ? ! ! !
why ? ? ? ! ! !
! i
though it would be deep or about something more interesting .
i do not recommend the movie
even to leave on while sleeping ...
