wow 
here it finally is ;
the action `` movie ''
without action .
in a real low-budget setting
( do not miss the hilarious flying saucer flying by a few time )
of a future seattle
we find a no-ain hardbody
seeking to avenge her childhood.there
is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot
and the actor ' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempt
to steal from other movie 
mainly `` matrix ''
without having the money
to do it right .
yes 
we do get to see some running on wall and slow motion shoot-out
( 45 secs approx . )
but these scene are about as cool as the stupid hardbody 's attempt
at making joke about male incompetence now and then.and 
yes ,
we are also served a number of lead
that lead absolutely nowhere ,
as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast
while shooting the scene.believe me ,
it is as bad
as it possibly can get .
in fact 
it does not deserve to be taken seriously ,
but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it
and save your money .
