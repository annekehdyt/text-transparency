has there
ever been a movie more charming than this ?
one of the reason
everything works so well
is that the group of actor really seem to interact
and have an effect on each other 's life .
the center of it is the `` romance '' of jame stewart and margaret sullavan ,
who work together
and can not get along face to face
but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pal .
but there are also supporting character and unlike a lot of romantic comedy
( including `` you have got mail '' 
the recent update of `` shop '' )
they are not just whipped up
to support the two lead and their need .
everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch 's rich tapestry of charm .
one of the most heartwarming scene in movie history takes place
when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly search for someone to have christmas dinner with .
a must see !
**** out of ****
