when this movie first came out back in 1984 ,
prince was one of the hottest act around .
everyone wanted to see this movie ,
which was not much more than a extended music video .
the acting was pretty bad ,
but what can you expect from musician acting on the big screen for the first time ?
despite that 
it was still a very entertaining film !
morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy 
especially their rendition of `` the password '' ,
which will make you think
of abbott and costello doing their `` who 's on first '' baseball routine.appolina
( who went by a single name then )
provided some beautiful east ,
so you had the ief nudity covered .
plus 
she is very attractive .
and of course 
the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince
ever recorded .
prince later on had a fallout with warner bros.
and changed his name 
but at this particular time in his career 
he was at the top of his game.this movie does not rank in the all time great category ,
but it is pretty entertaining .
