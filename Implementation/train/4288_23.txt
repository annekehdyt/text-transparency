this film is fantastic
as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would 
for adult .
the idea of a child 's drawing becoming a place
she can physically visit
and have influence over is wonderful .
at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it
and say
she is really exploring her subconscious ,
just as we all do in our dream
when we sleep .
the bit
that gives me goose-pimple
is when her dad is in the paper house ,
and chases her .
the only thing i can not stand is
that it was marketed as a horror film ...
it really is not .
if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline
which keeps you guessing
without the usual cheap thrill most film
have to use ,
then watch paperhouse .
