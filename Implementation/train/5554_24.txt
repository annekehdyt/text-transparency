i found this movie quite by accident ,
but am happy
that i did .
kenneth branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter ,
but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie .
this movie ought to mind the excellent movie
that branagh made with emma thompson .
carter 's star turn here as a disabled young woman
seeking to complete herself
was as good a performance
as i have seen from a female lead in a long time .
portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off ,
but with basically only her eye
to show her pain about her situation in life ,
she made it so believable .
if this movie had come out after the current wave of movie with beautiful woman `` uglying '' themselves up for role
( charlize theron 
halle berry ) ,
i fell sure
carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar .
if you run across this movie on cable late at night
as i did ,
trust me ,
it is worth the lost sleep .
