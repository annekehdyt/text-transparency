i own this movie and have watched it several time throughout the year
since it was released .
prince does not stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything ,
he is a musician and i feel
like that is what he displayed here ,
he is just the best one
to tell this story through influence .
most of this movie is straightforward and teenish
but that is the directors/writer fault ,
still it is a great movie with even better music .
the principal and moral conviction in purple rain are quite strong
and if more movie would rely on the basic we are taught
as young child we would have a better all around environment
seeing
that art reflects life
which reflects art .
