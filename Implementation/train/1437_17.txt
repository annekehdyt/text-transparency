often laugh out loud 
sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guy
-- lemmon a neurotic clean `` house husband '' and matthau a slob sportswriter --
who decide to live together
to cut down on expense .
nicely photographed and directed .
the script is very barbed
-- that is ,
there is always more than one side to almost every line .
particularly funny scene involves 2 itish sister
( evan and shelley )
who seem amused by everything anyone says ,
but when lemmon bust out his photos of kid and 
yes 
ex-wife-to-be 
he has the girl sobbing along with him
before matthau can show up with the promised drink ! very entertaining .
