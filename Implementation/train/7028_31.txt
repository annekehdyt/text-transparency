i was never quite sure
where this thing was going .
these person seem interested in what is going on on some mountain .
they investigate ,
have narrow escape 
leave ,
come back 
leave ,
put each other in danger 
sleepwalk ,
get attacked by witch
who have consistent wardrobe 
etc. 
etc .
the guy seems to like the girl ,
but leaves her unprotected numerous time .
she gets taken off ,
he gets her back ,
leaves her again .
you get the point .
the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice ,
i think ,
but i am not sure ,
or turning person into witch ,
but i am not sure .
it is just dull and endless and not worth the time .
there are some atmospheric scene ,
but the print is so bad
that there time
when twenty second of blackness is not unusual .
is this caused by age or the overuse of night filter .
