a young solicitor in sent to a remote area
to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client .
when he arrives he finds
that he is made less than welcome by the local villager
and that his deceased client was not liked .
to speed thing up
he decides to move from the local inn
and take up residence in her home 
a house
that is usually fogbound
and approached only by a causeway
that is blocked off by the sea most of the day .
once there
he sees vision of a woman in black ,
is she real or imaginary ,
he is also subjected to the blood curdling cry of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marsh ,
these event take their toll on him
and he soon becomes quite terrified .
atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill ,
that spends it first third building up its character ,
before moving to the creepy country house ,
its poor colour contrast give away its tv root immediately ,
this really should have been in black and white 
but still as a ghost story
it had a couple of unsettling moment ,
still though after waiting so long to see it i must say
i was sadly just a little underwhelmed .
