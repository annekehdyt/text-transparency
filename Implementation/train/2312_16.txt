i would even say
some shade of hitchcock ... this is clearly better than mmm ,
which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fan .
by the way 
did you know
that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery ?
anyhow 
woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one .
the plot turn are nice and tight .
i will say
that in the first 20 minute or so 
some of the actor are a little too hasty at delivering their line ,
but stick around .
scarlett johansson proves well-cast in the diane keaton-type role ,
and at no time is there any uncomfortable moment between her and the much older woody .
no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman .
