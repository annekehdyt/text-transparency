what hopkin does succeed at with this effort
as writer
and director is giving us a sense
that
we know absolutely no one in the film .
however 
perhaps therein lies the problem .
his movie has a lot of ambition
and his intention were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within ,
but it is so impersonal .
there are no character .
we never know
who anyone is ,
thus there is no investment on our part.it could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own character .
is it ?
maybe .
by that i do not mean that slipstream is ambiguous ;
i mean that there is no telling .
hopkin 's film is an experiment .
on the face of it 
one could make the case
that it is about a would-be screenwriter ,
who at the very moment of his meeting with fate 
realizes
that life is hit and miss ,
and/or success is blind chance ,
as he is hurled into a `` slipstream '' of collision between point in time 
dream 
thought 
and reality .
nevertheless 
it is so unremittingly cereal
that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion 
even to the tiny 
quite rudimentary extent
of allowing us a connection with its character.i
did not think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky 
machine-gun-speed camera-work and editing disengaged me ,
but reflecting upon the film i
am beginning to realize
that it had a lot to do with it .
there are so many movie of the past decade
in which the cut or camera movement have sound effect as well as other atmosphere-deteriorating technical doodad .
i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dream .
however 
i knew barely anything about slipstream
when watching it ,
and i came out the same way .
and i just do not care ,
because hopkin made no effort
to make us care .
there are interactive movie ,
and there are movie
that sit in a rocking chair and knit 
unaware of your presence .
slipstream is the latter .
