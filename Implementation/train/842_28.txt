when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed
it was going to be like sex and the city ,
however this drama is nothing like it .
the story the character seem more real
and you empathise with the situation more .
the concept of the drama is similar ,
four 30 something woman guide us through there friendhip and relationship with problem
and strife along the way .
katie the gp is a dark and ooding character
who you find difficult to relate too
and is best friend with trudi a widow .
trudi 's character is heart warming
as you can relate to difficulty
she is having along with the fact
she is the only mother of the four .
jessica is the party girl very single minded
and knows
what she wants and how to get it .
she is a likable character
and is closest to siobhan the newly wed
who whilst loving her husband completely can not help her eye wandering to her work colleague .
over all the drama is surprisingly addictive
and if the bbc continue to produce the series
it could do well .
it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city 
or desperate housewife .
this if played right could be the next cold foot .
plus the male cast are not bad on the eye too .
