i love ashley judd
and think
all of her movie are great .
rubyin paradise is one of her best .
it is a very understated movie
that you really have to watch close to appreciate it .
a story of a woman
trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptation
that would make her life easy .
some of her movie such as kiss the girl and time
to kill probably did better at the box office and video rental .
they were very good moviealso ,
but take the time
to really look at ruby and i think
you will agree
it is one of ashley 's best .
