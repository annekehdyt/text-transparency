i thought
this movie had absolutely no moral .
i mean 
how would you feel
if your fianc\u00e9 left you on your wedding day for your cousin ? ? ?
i would be heartoken ! !
it is classified as a comedy
but i did not find it funny at all .
i thought
it just mostly found cheap laugh
and took them .
i normally love julie stile movie ,
but this is an exception .
jason lee star in another disgraceful show ,
which once again proves
that class and decent moral are not relevant in todays society .
it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movie like this .
i understand
that person will defend this movie
and it is moral
because it is 'just a movie ' ,
but i still stand by my mark
that this bad behaviour should not be allowed on screen .
i am not trying to say
that
if you enjoyed this movie ,
you are a bad person ,
as everyone is entitled to their own opinion ,
and part of this movie were enjoyable ,
i am just saying
that in real life 
person acting like the character in this film were doing is shameful .
