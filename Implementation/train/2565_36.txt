i knew nothing of this film
before i was convinced to see it by a friend
who had heard
it was a `` non-stop epic battle scene from beginning to end '' .
that could not have been further from the truth .
this was one of the most boring ,
poorly written 
amateurishly directed ,
horribly acted film i have ever had the misfortune
to lay my eye upon .
i would rank it up there with the movie i
consider to be the worst film of all time ... battlefield earth .
there basically is no story ,
it is hard to believe
that the maker of this film thought
that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact .
it also features some of the worst dialogue i
have ever heard ... like this little gem ... guy tells girl
`` you smell like the moon . `` .
girl replies `` what does the moon smell like ? ''
omg !
you have to be kidding me !
the scene
where the guy was drawn
and quartered got some good laugh from the audience
since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy
being ripped apart reminded me
of someone
making a fart sound with their mouth .
if this is playing at a theater near you ,
avoid it at all cost .
this movie is so bad
that i actually made the decision about 45 minute through
that i needed to catch up on my sleep ...
and i did .
awful .
