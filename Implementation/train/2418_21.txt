second-feature concern a young woman in london desperate for a job ,
happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son .
thriller about person
being held in a house against their will
always make me a little uneasy
-- i end up feeling like a prisoner too --
but this rather classy b-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic .
it is far-fetched and unlikely 
but not uninteresting 
and our heroine
( nina foch )
is quick on her foot .
rehashing this in 1986
( as `` dead of winter '' )
proved not to be wise ,
as the plot-element are not of the modern-day .
`` julia ross '' is extremely compact
( too short at 65 minute ! )
but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax ,
which feels a little sloppy .
