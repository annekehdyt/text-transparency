the part where meg visits the mechanic
and he says
- `` is the piston firing short ? ''
( implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc\u00e9e )
was hilarious .
i love meg ryan
and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie .
very lovable and very intelligent too .
her innocent indignant expression have you wishing
she was yours .
the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well .
einstein had a romantic side to his psyche ?
the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well .
it is awfully underrated and deserves accolade and attempt at a revival .
it loses out one vote
for including the highly improbable far fetched theory
being bought by the us govt .
i do not see
why it does not figure in the top 20 romantic comedy of the century .
great movie 
it has the presidential seal of approval on it !
