it has been said
that deanna durbin invented teenagery .
this first film was one of the best .
the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna 
a little beauty with a gorgeous voice ,
as the `` miss fixit '' in a family
split by divorce .
for plot summary 
see other imdb entry 
but quickly deanna and her two older sister plan to go to america from switzerland
to prevent their father from remarrying .
with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sister 
good direction and editing ,
the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewing .
of deanna 's three song 
only `` il bacio '' is from the classical repertoire ,
but
when she sings it in that police station scene ,
the film 's place in history is assured .
at least it was for this viewer
who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music .
one of the many nice touch
that occur throughout three smart girl is the ief glimpse of the drunk
stretching his neck for a final glimpse of deanna
as the cop hustle him by !
one unfortunate result of the success of this film
was that subsequent writer for durbin vehicle became locked into the `` miss fixit '' theme ,
which quickly became stale .
deanna herself never did .
her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma ,
which she certainly had .
it seems to me that 
like many another film personality 
she substituted `` naturalness '' for the histrionic ability
that she lacked .
the ploy worked well for 21 feature film .
