in the sequel to the illiant bill and ted 's excellent adventure 
bill and ted are under threat from the future ,
as the evil chuck de nomolos send two evil robot 
disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted ,
in order to change the future.in a great comedy pairing 
winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel .
though lacking the sharpness of the first 
bogus journey still has the great catchphrase and dialogue from the leading pair ,
not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler ,
who ings a humorous side to the figure of depth 
the grim reaper .
watch for the game sequence 
the best moment in the entire film 
but one of many great technique
used
to justify the genre.though
still packed with humour ,
this film has a more dramatic film toward it ,
with stake being more serious and situation more risky .
this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature .
the creator also stretch the boundary of the fantasy genre and the use of realism 
with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot .
the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use
of that amazing time travelling machine 
though again somewhat confusing at point with the use of timing 
and object and situation being placed
before it happens in the present ,
as is evident in the final couple of scenes.the first watch i hated this sequel ,
but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the joke and story more ,
and though the joke and plot are not as strong as its predecessor 
bogus journey has enough feel good motive 
joke and a fairly steady plot
to make it a good natured family film .
