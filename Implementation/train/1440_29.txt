i watched this movie
and the original carlitos way back to back .
the difference between the two is disgusting .
now i know
that person are going to say
that the prequel was made on a small budget
but that never had anything to do with a bad script .
now maybe it is just me ,
but i always thought
that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie 
starring key character and maybe filling in a bit about life
that we did not know .
rise to power is just a movie
that has carlito 's name .
there should have been at least a few character from the original movie ,
the ending makes no sense in relation to the original .
in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart
but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie ?
and his woman is not even the same woman
that he talks about as his only love in the original .
i would say
the movie is mildly entertaining in its self 
with a few decent bit
but it pales
when held up
to it is big other .
do not lay awake at night waiting to see this ,
watch the original one more time
if you really need a hit .
