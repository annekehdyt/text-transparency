i just saw this movie the other day
when i rented it ,
and i thought
this was going to be just another movie with a girl
trying to prove a point ,
but diane joined boxing
because she wanted to .
i thought
this movie was good .
i gave it a 8/10 .
that is how good it is .
plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good .
even is she is been in only six .
