this is a film
that can make you want to see it again .
i especially 
liked the way it ended .
i did not see the end coming ,
but
when law was not blown away the first time ,
one suspects
he will be back again.the story is gripping
and could have been more psychological ,
but i understand
the story needed
to capture the viewer and the action
was necessary for that.hard to believe
michael jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger other and mother as blown away .
but 
i can appreciate the scene play could not really take our attention there
because it had a greater story to tell.some
have complained about hank as a gangster .
i believe
that is not justified .
if his character had been any harder ,
he would not have cared
if his son pulled a trigger or not.eight star for this one .
although it was released in 2002 ,
i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd .
