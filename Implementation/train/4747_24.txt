i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novel
and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her book as a child .
when i was a child i wasn`t
really interested in litreture
unless it had soldier fighting monster complete with a high body count
judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden
i guess
pearce writes for lower middle class kid since much of the story of revolf around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden
then suddenly finding a metaphysical one .
having a garden of your own was no doubt something
that working class person didn`t have in the 1950s so i guess
there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere .
there`s also a romance
involving a young girl
called hattie
but again are cynical kid amoured by love story ?
perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happen
within the narrative this is a childrens film
that seems dated by its source .
it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voter .
i wonder
how many of them would have given it so many high mark
if they were 10 year old who`d
just seen the lord of the ring trilogy ?
