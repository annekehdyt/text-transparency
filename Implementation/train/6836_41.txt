losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre
which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world .
usually 
they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent ,
interspersed with copious disrobing .
this is not a complaint ,
especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful woman
who invariably inhabit this make-believe world.kim ward
( kira reed )
is suffering a bout of writer 's block .
just by chance ,
( or is it ? )
she meets a man
( doug jeffery )
who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounter .
the man refuses to divulge any information about himself ,
yet kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair .
her agent 
alexa
( anneliza scott )
thinks
it will do wonder for her book sale .
as in most film of this type 
the denouement comes near the end
but some thing do not add up .
i have seen enough of this kind of film to think ,
no change there ,
then - but i like them .
they are so undemanding.performance of the cast vary .
doug jeffery carries the film
as the psycho/sociopath you do not want to cross .
kira reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril .
clay greenbush as the pi did not convince either.finally 
a note of caution about the dvd under review .
both the cover and the disc state r-rated and running time as 93 minute
but the run time is less than 86 minute .
this probably explains
why the sex scene appear truncated
and why jennifer ludlow 's performance is cut short just
as she is getting started .
4 star .
