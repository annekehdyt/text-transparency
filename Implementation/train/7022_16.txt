i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick ,
but this is just bad .
and not bad in a way you might enjoy
seeing mst3k make fun of it .
it is just nauseatingly bad like you can not find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try .
i truly regret wasting 2 hour of precious life on this crap .
you can tell by watching it
that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew
this film would only bury their career .
apparently `` walking tall '' has garnered enough income
that someone decided
they could make a buck off their investment .
if it is not the worst film i
have seen ,
it is so bad
that it is blotted the worse film from my memory .
