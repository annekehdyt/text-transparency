this movie is amazing .
the plot was just ... wow.i was very surprised by gackt 's and hyde 's performance ,
after growing up in the american world of the actor
who can not sing and singer
who can not act.in this movie 
a young sho
( gackt )
comes across a vampire 
kei
( hyde ) .
over time 
they form an unlikely friendship .
kei is suffering
because of how he is forced to live off other ,
the half-life of a vampire.it is a sad movie 
but not sappy .
the plot was very unique ,
and contrary to your typical vampire flick .
the storyline was thick with twist and turn and very entrancing.the only fault i would say
the movie had ,
despite it is lack of a happy
-- albeit peaceful\u0097ending 
would be it is multiple language .
i had the unsubdued version
( i am lucky
that i understood it all save some of the can notonese ) ,
so i would recommend getting something with subtitles.all in all ,
the movie was just awesome .
