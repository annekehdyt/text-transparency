just get it .
the dvd is cheap and easy to come by ,
the length is now standard
and you have gone long enough
without it .
( when home video started ,
there were at least three version with part missing.. )
everything you have read is true .
there is no defending it ,
and no
living without it .
the color is lush and wonderful to look at ,
and the production value are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic .
but no question..the whole santa vs. satan angle is so jaw dropping strange
it made the movie
a hit at the time and a cult fave
once home video really got underway .
how good/bad/strange/ is it ?
i only saw the trailer as a kid ,
and remembered it for nearly 30 years..including murray 's over the top voice over..i told my older sister ,
and she called me a liar
and could not believe
it was possible for anyone to make a movie
where santa vs.satan.. add to it stuff like santa
asking for the virgin mary 's blessing
before setting off on christmas eve 
kid wanting to capture him
and make him their slave..and an international kiddie sweat shop..and
it probably comes close to a lot of nightmare kid
had in the 60's.. like other here 
i watch the thing every holiday season now .
( my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition ) .
but any old way
you choose it ,
the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must
( along with brianiac 
by the way.. )
.it never fails to make me laugh .
better ,
i think ,
then santa claus conquer the martian .
part of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out .
( how many parent do you know go out for cocktail on christmas eve ?
`` if you get bored ,
just go downstair
and play the piano . ''
dang.. )
freaky 
boring 
disturbing 
funny 
childish 
strange..hey 
what more can you want ?
