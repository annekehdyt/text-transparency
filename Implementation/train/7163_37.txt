les visiteur 
the first movie about the medieval time traveler was actually funny .
i like jean reno as an actor ,
but there was more .
there were unexpected twist 
funny situation and of course plain absurdness ,
that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes.now this sequel has the same character 
the same actor in great part and the same time traveling .
the plot changes a little ,
since the character now are supposed to be experienced time traveler .
so they jump up and down in history ,
without paying any attention to the fact
that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie .
the duke 
jean reno 
try to keep the whole thing together with his playing ,
but his character has been emptied ,
so there is not a lot
he can do to save the film.now the duke 's slave/helper ,
he has really all the attention .
the movie is merely about him
and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever
he was supposed to be .
fact is ;
this character try to produce the laughter from the audience ,
but he does not succeed .
it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke ,
you already know ,
but he insists on telling
that joke till the end ,
adding detail ,
to make your suffering a little longer.if you liked les visiteur ,
do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel .
if you did not like les visiteur ,
you would never consider seeing the sequel .
if you liked this sequel ... well ,
i suppose you still need to see a lot of movie .
