what a let down !
this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting character .
admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail ,
but i was nevertheless gripped
and kept watching.david morrissey is always good value
and he suranne jone were good lead .
the muslim aspect were very interesting .
we were tantalised with possible terrorist connections.but
then morrissey 's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon .
the last episode was dull 
dull 
dull .
the whole thing turned out
to be very small beer
and the d\u00e9nouement was unbelievably feeble.five hour of my life for that ?
my advice :
watch paint dry instead .
