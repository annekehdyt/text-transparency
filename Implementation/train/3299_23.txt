my friend and i rented that movie last night
and we had one of the greatest laugh in awhile .
the movie is not supposed to be funny at all ,
but it is just so ridiculous
and it lacks any realism whatsoever .
first 
phillippe
( i forget what his character is called and i do not really care )
uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminal .
not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous effort culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room ,
which hosts the super computer .
this is plain funny .
the tense mood
that we are supposed to experience
is completely spoilt by the childish looking room .
the ending 
like all else 
is very very very cheesy ,
especially when the bad guy 's lawyer shows up 'right on time ' .
anyway 
this movie is a good laugh .
if you need something to make fun of ,
definitely see it .
