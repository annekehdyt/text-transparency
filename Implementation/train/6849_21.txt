so mary and rhoda have aged
-- who has not ?
i was a teen
when mary premiered 
and a `` young adult ''
when it left the air .
yes 
it was great to see mary and rho together ,
and yes ,
maybe the film did not sustain the comedy of the original series ,
but there were enough moment
that recalled the spirit of the series
to make this a fitting tribute .
example :
the producer
who hires mary
and then dictates the idea for a new series about `` old person . ''
is not this typical of the mentality of present-day hollywood tv and film `` bean counter ? ''
this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best
-- but it is a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows
we grew up with in the 70s .
