a good cast
( with one major exception )
pushes its way through epstein 's smart light satire .
mansfield was never better 
or funnier ,
than she is here paired with walston ,
who 's a veteran
who 's determined to become a congressman
to get out of the war .
he and his buddy
-- including suave con-artist grant --
head to san francisco on leave
and start the city 's swinginest party
while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial
speaking tour .
the only thing about this movie
that is not delightful
is suzy parker 's one-note performance as grant 's love interest ,
which takes up too much of the film 's time
and slows down the pace in the second half .
walston and mansfield have good chemistry ;
the gimmick is that
she is set on making love to every serviceman
( to do her duty for the war effort 
of course )
but he is a married man
who 
nonetheless ,
loves his wife .
they steal the movie with little trouble from grant
( who 's amusing here in the first part of the film ,
when not paired with his non-actor co-star .
