by no means is this movie as bad as 'perfect stranger ' ,
but it just was not funny .
it could not stick to one type of comedy -
it jumped from snl 
to adam sandler-esquire 
to romantic 
to little guy score big 
to slapstick 
to 'loser '
( the movie )
type of comedy .
although there were some pretty funny slapstick moment
( the fall down the hill ) ,
no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way .
'schindler 's list ' was funnier
( and felt shorter ) .
you never knew
if andy samberg was supposed to be in high school 
a college dropout 
or just a loser
living at home with his mother - sissy spacek 
in her worst choice of role .
and poor ian mcshane 
the serious actor
if i only had to name one ,
is given crap to read into the camera .
the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end
( no spoiler here
in case adam samberg 's mom wants to see it ) .
do not spend any money
going to see this movie ,
and maybe lorne michael will get the hint
and start producing quality
( yes 
wayne 's world and tommy boy are quality ) movie .
