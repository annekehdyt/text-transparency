this movie is hilarious .
the problem is that
it is not a comedy .
one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel-horse in the middle of a village square
( which he uses to pummel the bad guy . )
another is the trek into the `` village of crazy . ''
too bad this movie was not made to be a farce ,
or it may have gotten better rating .
