when i look back on my college day at ohio university ,
there will always be one event
in which i will remember with fond memory .
channel 23 is ou 's local access channel and until the last few year ,
pretty much played anything
they were sent .
this included many diy movie
ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow peep and then scanning picture of them online 
to a version of macbeth starring 8th grader
who had apparently just learned how to make squibs.however ,
the king 
in my opinion 
of the channel 23 lineup was midnight skater .
the first time i watched it was around 2am .
i should have been studying .
or sleeping .
or watching regular tv .
but no 
all that is for pussy .
my roommate and i watched midnight skater ,
and
when it was complete ,
i do not think either of us believed
that any of the movie had just happened .
but sure enough ,
it was on a few night later ,
and we had to come to grips
that this movie did ,
in fact 
exist.i could go on and on about how awful it is ,
but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living .
the plot is disjointed 
the acting terrible 
the everything soul scarring 
but by god ,
if there are other watching with you ,
its impossible not to have a good time
watching it .
its sort of like the first time you hear `` gut '' by chuck pahalniuk .
you hear it ,
you are disgusted and shaken ,
but five minute later 
all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured.long story short 
midnight skater 
for all of its epic flaw 
makes for some very late night fun .
plus 
i desperately want the theme to midnight skater .
kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it .
sweet god i love that song .
