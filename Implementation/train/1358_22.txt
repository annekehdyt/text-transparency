this first two season of this comedy series were very strange
and they were not very funny
and had a drama element
where bill
( the mother )
was struggling with all the usual problem in life
but that element was a bit depressing
and did not mix well with th comedy element
which is probably why it was dropped .
after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series
the bbc have ever made !
the chemistry between bill and ben 's character 's were very funny
and there was always so many illiant and memorable sketch in each series .
the christmas special were hilarious and a real treat for christmas .
the show came to a stop
when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away
which was very sad
because he was a illiant actor in film such as up 'n ' under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screen
and does not to be repeated that often -
though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while
but it should be repeated on bbc one or two
to show this illiant comedy to a new audience
