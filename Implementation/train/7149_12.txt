very poor effort
that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci ,
who tries ,
but can not save the poor structure 
dialogue 
direction 
or talent of our leading man.pretty
much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has ,
is its quirky side character .
but without a realistic backdrop ,
such character are pointless.nothing to see here ,
keep moving ...
