i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way
through because it truly was painful .
an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man ?
this movie was rife with absurdity
of which
if i mentioned them
all i would be giving away the movie .
norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut
to have agreed to do this movie .
the acting was deplorable
and the story was even worse .
as a sane minded and rational individual 
i could not understand
where the writer came from nor
where he was going with this movie .
there was ineptness on the part of every main character ,
there was a string of hapless and ridiculous event ,
then the movie ended .
one absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a movie ,
it only makes a talkative train wreck .
