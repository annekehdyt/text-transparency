first off i really enjoyed zombi 2 by lucio fulci .
this film was utter trash .
i could not stand to watch it .
the storyline was a joke ,
the acting was a joke ,
and the fact
that zombi 3 has nothing to do with zombi 2
is even more a joke.we jump from voodoo to death 1 the harmful agent brining person back to life .
whatever 
this movie is not worth the $ 1.00
it cost to rent it .
i really enjoyed lucio fulci movie
but this one was horrible .
if zombi 3 is an indicator
for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be i think
i will just skip them.zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho .
