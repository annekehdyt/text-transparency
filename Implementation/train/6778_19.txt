the volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriter .
thankfully 
highly acclaimed director nelson mccormick has ought us the second best volleyball movie of all time
( rated lower than side out and higher than 
well 
umm ) .
however 
do not let the cover of this movie decieve you .
kill shot stars up and coming star koji as a modern day sherlock holme .
using such high-tech gadget as a computer
that is less powerful than my gameboy ,
koji is able to aid fbi agent in the tracking of a man
who has not committed any obvious crime .
while there are other actor in the movie ,
including ief cameos by denise richard 
a gay negro 
and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl ,
koji carries this movie on his own .
any fan of movie such as the matrix or hacker will definitely love kill shot .
