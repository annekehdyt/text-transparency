ok 
the box looks promising .
whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting .
then you pop this baby in the dvd player
and all hope is lost in less then five minute .
supposed to be a comedy .
and i must admit
i did laugh once about ten minute before the ending .
this movie has the following element :
a battered and abused next door neighbor 
a boring legal trial 
racisim 
talk of lynching 
and death and arson .
hilarious 
huh ?
no 
please ,
if you never listen to anyone 's review ,
please do here .
you can not even force yourself to watch this crap .
crap !
i said it 
crap !
whoever put there name on this should indeed sue .
