i am all for a `` bad '' horror movie
but this was just a pile of dog sh ! t !
how anyone can call this movie cool or decent
is beyond me .
if you like rushed editing to cover the special effect ,
bad acting and a bad script
then go for it !
there was no suspense whatsoever
and the gore factor was laughable
because it was so fake .
i will take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day .
my partner gave up after about 20 minute ,
she knows a stinker
when she sees one .
i on the other hand stupidly
sat through the whole movie
just to wait
and see
if it got any better .
no such luck !
i have not sen his other movie torched and i doubt
if i will bother now .
