9 
the film i have been looking forward to for month ... .
was little more
then a disappointment.i was deeply surprised by 9 's lack of story and strange character development .
all the awesome action sequence in the world do not make up for a single unsympathetic character .
the strange 
almost thrown in occult sequence were not only out of place ,
they were infuriating .
the story is about robot and scientist ...
why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbol and green magic ghost line
instead of giving answer to what could have been excellently scary story device ?
? how 
what 
when 
why ... . question
that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely
that you will as you get away from the theater .
a film like this is frustrating
because of its lack of depth ... . i would watch this film drawn in crayon
if the story was good .
but the filmmaker have relied on cgi wizardry and tim burton name
to draw in the crowd .
which ... is what drew me
in
but failed to gain my respect.9 could have been awesome ... with a few more rewrite and a little more respect from its own creator .
