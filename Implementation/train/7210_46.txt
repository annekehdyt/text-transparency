i have always wanted to see this
because i love cheesy horror movie and with a title like this 
i was sure
`` the incredible melting man '' would be a lot of fun.it really was not .
i mean 
the acting was entertainingly bad ,
the script
contained some classic bad line and the special effect
looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor ,
so i should have loved it .
unfortunately it is really draggy between these highlight .
i decided to watch the last half of the movie
while doing my tax return .
that is how boring this film is.nevertheless ,
if you love bad movie
you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse 
and the stellar acting of the guy
who plays dr. ted .
to be fair to the poor man ,
he does have to deliver some amazingly inept line with straight face - like the conversation
he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man : ''
i will find him with a geiger counter . ''
`` is he radioactive ? ''
`` just a little bit . ''
yes 
the plot has dr. ted wandering
about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed
only with what looks like a mini-dyson .
he is a ave man .
unfortunately his plan fails
when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree .
`` oh god -
it is his ear ! ''
says
dr. ted to the audience .
i am so glad
he cleared that up .
i realise i am making this movie sound rather fun .
it would be if it were only 10 minute long ,
but unfortunately it goes on and on ,
and the incredible melting dude just dangles about making a sticky mess
when he should be eating more person in my opinion .
i think
if you were truly stoned you would probably love it ,
just do not have pop-tart during the movie ,
because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end .
