bride are dying at the altar
and their corpse are vanishing .
no one knows why or who 
but an investigative reporter
( luana walter )
note
that each ide was wearing a strange orchid
and she goes to interview its creator 
dr. lorenz
( bela lugosi ) .
now dr. lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habit ,
including sleeping in coffin and injecting his elderly wife
( elizabeth russell )
with the fluid of young ide
to keep her young.the corpse vanish
has an interesting premise and a short enough run time
that it should not be able to get boring .
unfortunately ,
while it starts off quite well ,
it does start to drag before the halfway point
and gets rather boring with its clich\u00e9s and predictable plot.there are some good thing
about it-bela lugosi is charming and evil and perform illiantly ;
elizabeth russell is also a beautiful 
suave 
aloof and very creepy countess ;
and i am always a fan of angelo rossitto .
luana walter is also convincing as the reporter here.it maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere
and the set are decent.but overall ,
it just did not manage to hold my interest through the whole picture ,
and for that 
i have to rate it poorly .
