i have never seen many online movie in most of my life ,
but if i would pick any of them ,
i would pick spatula madness 
a clever reference to most movie like star trooper
( etc .
) ,
using a camera ,
and wit of steel ,
jason steele mastered the art
of turning a normal image into a painting ,
and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation
to get a world inhabited by spatula .
the story begins at the middle 
hows
that for director delight ?
then the middle is at the beginning ,
and so on ,
when i first watched it ,
i expected a soggy pixely look ,
but jason 
like me ,
loves look ,
so took every detail to the max .
although i do not recommend it for child ,
or would anybody besides me like it ,
but please search it up on the net
( its a short film ,
look up film cow ) 
its style reminds me of south park 
but less violent .
10 for the look 
6 for the laugh 
and 6 for the story ,
it all comes to a 10/10 
good workjason steele ,
i am anxious to see the movie .
