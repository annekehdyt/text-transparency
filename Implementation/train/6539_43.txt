the proverb `` never judge a book
by it is cover '' ,
was coined as a warning to those
who fail to look beneath the surface .
as i viewed the artwork to 
''
king of the ant '' i instantly thought horror !
the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover
and back spoke of a dark vision ,
the synopsis promised a story of murder 
betrayal 
and retribution .
instead what i discovered beneath
that surface 
was less interesting
than what you can find under your average rock .
`` king of the ant '' feature chris l. mckenna as sean crawley 
an average guy ready
to make a name for himself in this world ,
even if it means murder .
except sean crawley is someone you do not care about ,
never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character .
in fact he is downright unlikable ,
but not as much as daniel baldwin
( ray mathew )
who turns in an uninspired performance
as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue
he is forced to recite .
throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow
who apparently has unconditional trust
( esp .
in the homeless ) 
and little to no common sense 
and george wendt as duke ,
which is basically a sober norm from cheer
but mean !
now there are a couple of interesting `` hallucination '' sequence in this film
( the source of the cover image )
but this film never delves further into that world .
it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated character 
bad dialogue 
and unlikely event after unlikely event .
oh the horror !
