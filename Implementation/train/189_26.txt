i gave this 3 star out of a possible 10 -
because the story are open-ended and left unexplained ,
and because of the nauseating scene of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way ,
plus scene of a decaying corpse .
neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.the film 's plot ,
such as it is ,
concern three loosely interconnecting story ,
none of which conclude satisfactorily.the bounty hunter ,
played by bruce dern ,
is the character
that connects all three vignettes.first we have dylan mcdermott ,
looking darn fine 
as a wanted criminal
who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter 
when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl
played by helen hunt.then
we have one of the hemingway girl ,
not sure which one ,
playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier
who goes over to see about a neighbor woman 
an attractive redhead ,
whom
we soon realize
has been out in the badland a little too long.the conclusion of the film return to the bounty hunter
and what happens to him ,
with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension .
