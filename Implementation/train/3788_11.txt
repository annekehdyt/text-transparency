this movie is a 90 minute ramone concert with ief period of stupidity and absolute boredom .
what kind of high school is this anyway ?
unless you are a major ramone fan ,
do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did .
this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish .
this movie should be called ramone fever .
everyone appears to like them in this movie .
there is not a plot
to be found in this flick .
as far as teen comedy go ,
you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one .
