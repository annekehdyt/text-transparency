really 
really bad slasher movie .
a psychotic person escape from an asylum .
three year later he kills a sociology professor 
end of scene .
one semester yesterday later
( hey ,
that is what the title card said )
a new sociology professor is at the school .
she makes friend with another female sociology professor
who works there ,
and starts dating another professor .
the student are all bored ,
as are we.there are a number of title card
indicating
how much time has passed .
scene are pretty short ,
and cut to different character somewhere else ,
making for little progression of any kind .
a lot of scene
involve character walking and talking ,
or sitting and talking ,
and serve little purpose .
despite the passage of time ,
many of the character are always wearing the same clothing .
sometimes the unclear passage of time
mean
when we see a body for the second time ,
we ask ourselves :
how long has that body been there ?
and also 
at least one of the dead person do not seem to have been missed by others.the killer manage
to kill one person by stabbing her in the east 
another by stabbing him in the crotch ,
and another by slicing her forehead .
is his knife poisoned or something ?
the video box cover has a cheerleader :
there are not any in the movie .
the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of woman in a dorm room .
the central redhead in the photo is in the movie ,
but nobody ever wears such an outfit ,
and there is no such scene .
the killer is strictly one-on-one .
