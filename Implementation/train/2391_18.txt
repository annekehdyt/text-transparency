i have seen the original non-dubbed german version and i was surprised
how bad this movie actually is .
thinking i had seen my share of bad movie like ghouly 2 
rabid granny 
zombie lake and such ,
nothing could have prepared me for this !
it really was a pain
to sit through this flick ,
as there is no plot ,
no good acting and even the special effect are not convincing 
especially the so-called zombie 
wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothe ,
so their good set would not be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stain .
if you really want to waste 90 minute of your life ,
then watch it ,
for all the other ,
do not do it ,
because you will regret it !
