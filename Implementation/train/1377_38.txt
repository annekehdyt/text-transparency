dark comedy ?
gallows humor ?
how does one make a comedy out of murder ?
it can be risky business
as the viewer is required to let go of their moral value and laugh at the antic of a man
who kills person .
so 
the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality
in order to make it work .
so 
pierce brosnan 
the irishman 's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking 
sex-addicted alcoholic
who kills person for a living
and is having a life crisis .
he meets a struggling businessman 
greg kinnear 
and after a rocky beginning ,
he learns
that he needs a friend .
but 
greg 's happily married to hope davis and brosnan see in him the basic thing
he does not have 
love 
home and a life .
add character actor 
philip baker hall as the hit-man 's manager
and we are off to the race .
brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart 
the very human businessman .
hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear 's very conventional wife
who is fascinated with this derelict
who drifts into their life .
the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it .
you should leave the theater feeling 
at least 
partly good
-- if you are able to suspend being aghast at killing person .
