for the first couple of season ,
i thought
the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show .
the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job-interview was innovative ,
and the producer of the show managed
to keep the show relevant
and not too `` out there '' .the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke
and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all .
in the earlier season they used
to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related task -
now the focus is mostly in the boardroom
where the contestant are expected to do everything
to keep them on the show
( that means lying 
trash-talking 
backstabbing etc . ) .
the boardroom can be entertaining to watch ,
but it is entertainment at it is low-point -
sometimes you wonder
if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode .
the task on the show are 
at most 
boring and mostly a showcase for the company
who are dumb enough
to pay nbc for the publicity .
and what is the deal about half of the contestant living in tent in season 6 ?
that is just plain stupid
and has nothing to do with business in real-life .
i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestant this season ,
they all seem like idiot to me .
in earlier season at least some of the contestant had a bit of integrity ,
now it seems like the contestant would kill their own mother
to keep them on the show .
it also seems like donald trump 's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season
that pass
by and to be honest ,
i can not see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him .
his rationality in the boardroom mostly does not make any sense at all
and sometimes it seems he just like to trash person for what it is worth.r.i.p the apprentice .
please nbc 
for god 's sake 
get the show off the air as soon as possible .
it is just too embarrassing to watch .
the apprentice was once a great tv-show ,
but now it is just a big fat joke .
