after the superb aankhen
( 2002 )
which was a remake of a gujarati play
he comes with waqt
which too looks like a stage playin stage play ,
we have character shouting 
overacting here too the samethe first half show amitabh almost kidding the 40+ akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerdthe film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fakeeven his reason for hiding his sickness 
his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put offsome emotion do touch you
but most are too over the toprajpal 's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scene are good music is okayamongst actor amitabh overdo it in the first half
but is superb in emotional scene akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scene his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight ,
he makes you laugh
without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic part
but too loud at place priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do ,
this is her last film with akki
so far shefali is awesome
though she looks too young for bachchan
