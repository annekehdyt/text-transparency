pathetic ... worse than a bad made-for-tv movie .
i can not believe
that spacey and freeman were in this flick .
for some reason morgan freeman 's character is constantly talking about and saying `` pussy ''
when referring to nsync boy 's girlfriend .
morgan freeman
calling woman
`` pussy '' is just awkward ...
what the hell were the person behind this film thinking ?
too many plot hole
to imagine
combined with the horrid acting ,
confusing camera angle 
a lame script and cheap background music made this movie
absolutely unbearable.i rented this flop with low expectation ... .
but ... well ... it really sucked .
