a great concept gone wrong .
poor acting ,
even worse writing ...
.after
watching the first two episode i
was wondering
why it ever made it to season two .
the character are forgettable ,
the writing is poor ,
the set are just ok. the special effect are simply sad -
so much better has been made in the same time-frame -
where is the money going on this one ?
the first episode starts out interesting
then goes downhill fast - the precept of the whole show is just silly .
now do not get me wrong ,
i am a huge sci-fi fan and 'geek ' -
but this show simply does not cut it .
as i said in the beginning ,
i am truly surprised
it made it to season two -
so much better has been canceled after only one season
( jake 2.0 for example ) .
this show was just bad .
