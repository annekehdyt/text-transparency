okay .
so i just got back .
before i start my review ,
let me tell you one thing :
i wanted to like this movie .
i know
i have been negative in the past ,
but i was hoping to be surprised
and actually come out liking the film .
i did not.it is not just the fact
that every horror clich\u00e9 imaginable is in this .
and it is not just the fact
that they make every little thing into a jump scare
( walking into a baseball bat
left on the floor ?
are you kidding me ? ) .
it just was not scary .
one thing i was surprised about :
there was more blood than i thought
there was going to be..
which is not saying
much.the film starts off with donna
being dropped off by lisa 's mom at her house .
she comes in.. goes upstair .
camera pans to her father dead on the couch .
spooky .
she goes upstair ,
where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens .
find her other on his bed 
apparently dead
( how could she tell ?
he did not have a spot of blood on him ) .
killer comes in ,
donna hide under bed 
mom dy .
she runs outside screaming for help .
killer behind her :
`` i did it for us . ''
cut to therapy session .
this confused a lot of person- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it-
and she mentions
how the nightmare have started coming back .
filler dialogue ensues.they cut to the chase pretty quick .
few scene at the salon 
they go to the hotel .
of course the killer is already there
( for some reason ,
he escaped 3 day ago
but the police/family were not informed
until he is already there ) .
more filler ensues.i am not going to go on about what happens in the film ,
because i do not want to spoil it too much .
if you want to know
who dy ,
horror_fan made a post about it already .
but on the subject of death :
they were not that exciting .
person in the theatre actually laughed out loud
( an experience i have never had before in a horror movie ,
not even in when a stranger calls )
during several of them .
one in particular :
the bus boy guy
who gives the most hilarious 'scared ' face i
have ever seen .
the only death
involving any blood
was lisa 's ,
and that was pretty scarce .
her throat is slashed 
blood
( if you can even call it that-
it was practically black )
splatter on the curtain-thing .
the only other blood was on claire
when we see her body .
apparently 
fenton decided to stab her a few time
after he choked her to death .
um 
okay ?
the movie was one of the most clich\u00e9d i
have ever seen .
let 's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-boom !
scene .
check .
twice 
actually ( you could tell they were struggling ) .
mandatory backing-up-into-killer .
check .
there is also the backing-up-into-lamp scene ,
but you have all seen that .
oh 
you say
you want a birds-flying-away scare ?
well 
you got it !
( yes 
they managed to incorporate one of those in here ) .
and 
of course 
the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene .
shall i go on ?
i could.for
anyone saying
the character were not stupid ,
are you kidding me ?
`` oh ,
even though the massive alarm is ringing ,
literally saying
please vacate the building ,
and 3 of my friend are missing ,
i am going to go upstair to get my wrap . ''
these character were some of the most flawed and stupid character ever .
the only likable character - lisa - made one of the most stupid move in the movie .
`` oh 
i just realized
the psycho-teacher is here !
i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off
by myself to warn her !
oh 
shoot 
the elevator is being to slow ?
guess i will take the stair and run off into the construction site ! ''
ugh .
by the end of the film 
they all deserved to die .
the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna 's boyfriend
( i can not even remember his name- is that bad ?
) ,
and by that time 
the audience was completely drained out of this scareless ,
clich\u00e9d film.there were some positives-
the acting was decent for the most part ,
and it was well-shot .
but that is about it.i would give it a 1/5 ,
and that is being generous .
just for the laugh
( and believe me ,
the audience had a few ) 
and brittany snow.oh ,
and the reaction was bad .
very bad .
person were boo-ing
after the movie ended
and buzz afterward was very negative .
expect bad leg for this one .
