sunday would not be sunday
without an action movie ,
and
when you want intense combat ,
you turn to tom berenger
( platoon )
.here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebel and drug lord .
life 's a bitch ,
so he gets a green office type
( billy zane )
to help on the mission.the film
is in the hand of luis llosa ,
who stunk up anaconda .
he does not do much better here ,
but berenger makes the movie worthwhile.sure ,
it may be a little long -
who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle ,
but is is good 
tense action
when the time is right .
