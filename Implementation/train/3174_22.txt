the deceptive cover 
title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this movie.it started out really well
and pulled me in .
i really liked it .
between 1/3 and 3/4 's of it 
the film started throwing in thing
that were not set up
and made no sense .
my first thought was ,
`` this is not written by someone
who knows how to tell a story . ''
i ended up re-watching part of the movie ,
thinking
i had missed something.by the time i reached the last 1/5 of the movie ,
it was all boring 
annoying 
religion thumping dialog
that made no sense ,
said nothing ,
and was annoying to listen to ;
i turned off the sound
and did a fast forward to the end.do not waste your time with this flick.beware of dvds labeled whitlow film and level path productions.and i am a practicing catholic .
