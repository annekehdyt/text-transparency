this 
along with `` hare tonic 
'' ranks as one of the best bug cartoon 
indeed one of the best bug 
ever .
there are some comment
about how bug in these cartoon is `` basic 
'' meaning 
i guess ,
that he is as yet not fully developed .
i actually prefer this `` basic '' version from the mid-40s
( chuck jone ' was the best version )
who is actually more rabbit-sized and far more amusing than the eventual long-legged version
who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck .
the latter-day bug came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking .
also check out `` hair raising hare ''
( 1946 )
and `` rabbit punch ''
( 1948 )
for great example of classic bug and classic chuck jone .
