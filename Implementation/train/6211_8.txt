a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career .
while there is a lot of the `` eddie murphy character 
''
he plays a truly decent person .
the rest of the cast is good 
particularly the lovely charlotte lewis .
her character 's beauty and serenity held the tone of the film
from getting to be too much murphy .
