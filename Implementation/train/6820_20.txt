i have given this show
( i have only watched seven episode )
four star
because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail .
some are not funny outright ,
but some are amusing
-- in a 12 year old boy kind of way .
she reminds me of that new york painter
who throws paint upon a canvas ,
calls it art
and sells it for a lot of money .
silverman throws out what she is got ,
including the kitchen sink ,
while she prays
that a few thing stick to the wall in her effort
to be funny
but different.however what she is `` got '' often times is not enough ,
as though she lacks the kind of follow-through a good comedian
need to succeed.the whole enterprise
is like an under done potato .
