i have seen this movie a whole dozen time
and it is awesome .
but the only thing with it was that in the beginning ,
there was too much talk of who 's going out with who .
i think
that it would be interesting to do a remake of it .
but on the official site 
they said
that they will not be making a remake of it
because so many person have gotten saved
when viewing it .
what is even happened to patty dunning now ?
she is a pretty good actress .
she has done several other movie in the 70s and 80s ,
but we have not heard from her since .
i know for sure about thom rachford ,
who plays jerry ,
works for accounting at rd film .
but overall 
i have to say
that the series itself is like left behind gone old school .
