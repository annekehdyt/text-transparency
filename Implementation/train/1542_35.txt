***slight spoilers***a hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl
and eventually
he has sex for the first time .
after the act 
he lays in the bed with her not touching her .
the next day he concludes
that he does not like sex much
and does not want to try it again for at least a few years.this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality 
or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency.however ,
as the plot develops
what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father
who is supported
and encouraged by his overbearing mother.at one point 
his mother preach to her co-worker
who are not as understanding
as they might be 
`` every step of the way in this 
my son has been amazing ... i have never been more proud of him ... '' the young father 's older sister ,
who otherwise is cold towards her other ,
begins to show pride in her sibling ,
`` you have been cool about this 
''
as she gives him an encouraging warm hug.the 15-year-old father wants to be a father .
he wants to be a parent.why not ?
we see the `` new '' baby a few minute after birth
-- it appears to be a healthy 
happy 4-month-old infant .
just as baby were born on tv in the 1960 's and 1970's.once the young father is a parent ,
he has found happiness .
he insists
he will be the one
to change the dirty diaper .
we see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby
while the teen 's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder .
fade to black .
