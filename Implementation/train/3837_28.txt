there is something about pet sematary
that i never felt anywhere else .
maybe the fact i was a kid
when i first watched it made this experience so memorable .
but as i keep watching it over and over again ,
it never gets old ,
and i never get bored .
from the opening credit
with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending ,
there is something insane 
sad and scary at the same time ,
and it keeps ringing in your head :
sometimes dead is better !
i do not think
it would be useful to relate the whole story again .
all you need to know
is it starts from point a
( the most perfect situation for a happy american family )
and step by step drown to point b
( which is ,
believe me 
the very end of all joy ) .
the music is perfect ,
the story makes sense ,
the special effect are cool ,
and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be .
like i said ,
sometimes dead is better !
