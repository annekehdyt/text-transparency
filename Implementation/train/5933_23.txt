i first saw this
when they showed this around easter time 1993/4
and did not think much of it then ,
i bought this on dvd last summer
when i started getting into michael jackson
( i liked his music before )
and enjoyed it more now i am older .
it is a good film
but it will not be this classic film like the sound of music 
west side story 
the wizard of oz etc .
michael jackson as an actor was good
and so were the other cast member .
there were a disturbing scene
like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo
who was played by joe pesci .
the scene
that frightened me
when i was younger
was
when michael turns into a robot .
my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think
it was better than thriller in my opinion .
