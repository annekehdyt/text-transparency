i watched 'ice age'in the movie theater and i liked the movie .
spite of the fact
that 'ice age'has many flaw and scientific error 
like human 
saber 
dinosaur and mammoth living at the same period ,
and even the location of where the story pass
( looks north america ,
but has some characteristic from iceland for example )
we can have fun even so .
( unless you are very severe ! )
the planet is entering an ice age ,
and many animal are immigrating to the south
where is warmer .
sid is a stupid sloth
that is left behind by his own family ,
that can not stand him any longer.walking in his way ,
he meets manfred ,
or how he calls '' manny '' a moody mammoth
who does not care about extinction or immigration
and is going to the north .
worried
that he can easily be captured ,
sid decide to follow manfred ,
and in the middle of their journey 
they found a human mother with her baby .
the mother dies but manfred and sid decide to take him and return the baby for the human .
diego 
one of the saber 
decide to follow
and help them to go to a shortcut to the human 's camp .
what manfred and sid does not know ,
is that diego is from a saber clan
who hates human
and wants to kill the baby ,
and also pretend to betray
they both to make
they become saber 's food .
what will happen ,
will depend of diego 's behavior and conscience ... aka `` a era do gelo ''
