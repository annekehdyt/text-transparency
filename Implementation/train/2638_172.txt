i have rented
and watched this movie for the 1st time on dvd
without reading any review about it .
so 
after 15 minute of watching i have noticed
that something is wrong with this movie ;
it is terrible !
i mean 
in the trailer it looked scary and serious !
i think
that eli roth
( mr. director )
thought
that
if all the character in this film were stupid ,
the movie would be funny ...
( so stupid ,
it is funny ... ?
wrong ! )
he should watch
and learn from better horror-comedy such as : ''
fright night '' 
`` the lost boys '' and `` the return of the living dead '' !
those are funny !
`` cabin fever '' is the reason
why i
registered to www.imdb.com so i
can release my thought
of discontent about it.i have decided to watch the movie a second time > aaargh !
how bad can a script and a director be ? ? ?
this bad .
here are the awful scene in chronological order :
in the early scene
we see henry ,
who does not realize his dog
lying on the ground with its tongue
hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead !
the movie does not explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid
who like to bite people.and my answer to marcy 's unanswered question
( `` what is wrong with the wood ? '' )
is `` nothing '' .
the script has
that bearded guy warn them about the wood just for `` suspense '' .then the `` smartest '' of the 5-pack 
bert ,
almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire .
he meet now-infected henry
who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to eak the record
in using the `` f-word '' .
bert starts to freak out
because henry looks awfully ill. bert :
''
do not make me shoot you ! ''
( he forgets to add :
`` ... with my bb gun !
`` ) bert head back to the cabin
but how about that ?
he meet marcy and jeff
who were having sex ,
but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk !
marcy wisely takes out
the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier
( a moment of clarity for a change ? )
bert does not mention a word about henry
because the fool thinks
he has killed him with his bb gun.later ,
as the five estupido sit around their campfire ,
another weirdo shows up with his dog .
( maybe that is what the warning about the wood is all about ?
it is filled with weirdos ... and their dog ! ? )
they let him sit with them
only
because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis .
( their ain are completely intoxicated !
no wonder why they are all so dumb ! )
this is the last time
we will see this forgettable character ... alive !
henry shows up at their cabin ,
( note :
he was lying all the time a few yard from their cabin ! ! ! )
looking worse 
almost like a zombie ,
covered in goo !
he says
he needs a doctor .
but the young einstein refuse to help the poor sucker .
he gets into their unlocked truck
which of course also has its key in the ignition .
henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there
but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard 
seat and window .
the fantastic five come out running 
armed with : a bb gun 
a knife 
a baseball bat
( *huh ?
ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the wood ? ? ?
) 
a poker 
and a ( insecticide ? )
spray-can 
ready to combat the single 
unarmed and terribly sick man .
( clever script ! )
bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun ,
which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth .
`` what else am i supposed to do ? ''
bert yell in his defense .
jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss
and crash the truck 's window instead .
henry walk up to the dumb girl
who say :
`` he is coming toward us ! ''
( thank for the info 
dumb oad ,
i can see that !
but i do not think he wants to do you any harm ! )
marcy spray in his eye ,
making henry yelp !
and our `` hero '' paul touches henry 's arm with a burning log from the campfire ,
which they recklessly left burning
while they were inside the cabin !
( where has all that wisdom gone ?
i guess
the cannabis had started to take its toll !
:
- )
henry turns into the human torch
and runs away 
screaming.the
following day 
bert and jeff head out for a mechanic .
and marcy decide to `` go for help '' all by herself 
in the wood ,
as paul stays behind with karen ...
does not that sound idiotic ?
marcy could have stayed with karen and paul
because jeff and bert were already `` going for help '' !
i skip my comment now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river !
how did she get a canoe ?
does she even know
where she
is going ! ?
anyway 
she goes to the riverbank
and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and 
like in most horror movie 
walk inside the cabin saying : ''
hello ?
is anyone there ? ''
bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her
( and me at first ) .
and along comes jeff 
as well .
how did they get here ! ?
did they swim across the river ? ? ?
do you see
how ainless the script is !
? deputy winston meet paul at the cabin .
he somehow does not notice the blood on their truck .
this happens around 35 minute of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out .
( before i take my own eye out ! ... now ,
that is funny !
)
if you liked this movie ,
do yourself a favor and watch `` fright night '' ,
`` the lost boys '' 
or `` the return of the living dead '' .
then you will see
they are more entertaining than this ... thing .
even the `` toxic avenger part 2 '' ,
which is also a lousy film ,
is way more funnier than `` cabin fever '' .
