amelium and michael are a married couple
that are cheating on each other .
amelium has a long-time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute
that does not satisfy him .
the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.there is not a whole lot to this particular short .
the direction is straight-forward and dramatic ,
which is good ,
the acting is sincere ,
but the story leaves a little bit to be desired .
why 
exactly 
do we care about these two person ?
it is a little hard
to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story
except
that it is much more pared down
and does not search for meaning in it
( a welcoming change of pace if anything )
.i do not know ,
it is possible i do not connect to these story
because i have never experienced them .
but i have noticed
that the blocking in these narrative are typically the same 
i.e. ,
a couple talking together
while avoiding eye-contact by pretending
to be immersed in magazine 
etc .
the nice thing about short film is that they provide a bit more room
for trying something different ,
and i would like to see a different take.
