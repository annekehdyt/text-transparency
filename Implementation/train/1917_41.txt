ok this movie had a terrible premise .
be serious according to the movie
they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet
they have money to buy huge robot and pit them against each other .
each country decides instead of investing
into rebuilding their country
they would rather fight with robot no
one could afford .
here is a better idea ,
lets rely on our most inept resource 
jock ,
to fight our battle .
everyone says what about the director ,
what about him .
he makes a good movie ,
he makes a bad movie .
there is no reason
to give this movie some credit
just because of the director ,
maybe he was asleep ?
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie ,
because it was so cheesy
and ridiculous i had to laugh .
i actually had a good time
watching it 
well except for the cowboy mentor
who turns out to be an assassin
( trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin ,
so it is a surprise 
however lame )
what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway .
i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one .
i am giving a two star rating however
because nothing could be as bad as `` manos the hand of fate .
`` the budget does not matter either ,
i have seen plenty of reasonable movie
that had nothing for budget like cube .
the storyline was not even plausible
and i have seen better acting in school play .
surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.anyway pick it up ,
it is a fun movie to watch .
