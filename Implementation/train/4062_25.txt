i have seen just about all of miyazaki 's film ,
and they are all beautiful and captivating .
but this one rises above the rest .
this movie totally impressed me !
i fell in love with pazu and sheeta 
and their sweet 
caring friendship .
they were what made the movie for me .
of course 
the animation is also superb and the music captures the feeling in the film perfectly .
but the character are the shining point in this movie :
they are so well developed and full of personality.now ,
let me clarify :
i am really talking about the japanese version of the movie
( with english sub ) .
while the english dub is good
( mostly ) ,
it simply pales in comparison to the original language version .
the voice are better 
the dialogue 
everything .
so i suggest seeing
( and hearing )
the movie the way
it originally was .
