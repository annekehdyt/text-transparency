this film is not deserved of the next few minute i will spend criticizing it ,
but i know many person 
like myself 
rely on imdb.com to assist in deciding on film .
for that reason alone 
i am writing this .
`` live feed '' is like an asian version of 1976 's `` the incredible torture show ''
( aka `` blood sucking freak '' )
http :
//www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/ .
torture 
dismemberment 
murder 
cannibalism ... sure ,
it is all here along with a third-grade script ,
pathetic acting ,
and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.the film takes place in china ,
yet everyone speaks english .
there is an abundance of girl in the film
who are horrified by the butchering of dog in a marketplace ,
yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor .
one gal
who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moment later
is still there having at it with her friend boyfriend
( how he even got in there
might be the only engaging thing about this whole film . )
the film is absolutely awful 
even for a b-movie .
even if you were to download it for free ,
it would be an insult to your hard drive .
