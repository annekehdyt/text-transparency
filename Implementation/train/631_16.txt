this movie was just as good as some of the other western
made by anthony mann and jame stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur ,
and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river .
this film starts out like a run of the mill western
but gets more complex
as it goes along .
it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder .
he is found innocent
but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge .
stewart then agrees to lead something
but i forget what it is but stewart only care about getting his cattle back .
as the movie goes along
it is like stewart only care about himself just like his character in the naked spur .
it gets much better at the halfway point
after they arrive in alaska .
this is one of stewart 's better western .
