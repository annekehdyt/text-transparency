this is the kind of movie
the us does not make .
it is why person rent foreign film .
it is a great story about how one person ,
even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life .
everybody can learn from george .
it also shows how person
that are mentally challenged suffer in their life
and shows them in a very realistic way
( i think ) .
as its classic in foreign film this movie has a bittersweet ending ,
but that only makes it a better movie .
