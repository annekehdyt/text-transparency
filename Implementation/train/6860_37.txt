i rented this movie ,
thinking
it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece .
what i got was a piece of pure garbage .
this movie was confusing in most spot ,
choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spot .
mira sorvino 's portrayal of a queen
playing a young male scholar
was depressing at best .
ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his project .
fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley ;
at least the harry potter movie are more entertaining than this thing
they call a play
within a movie.the cinematography looks
like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably .
almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect ;
the end result of course
being the cheesiest bit of editing i
have ever seen .
jay rodan was almost good as agis ;
too bad he had such a bad script
to work with .
rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting .
in the end 
i really wish blockbuster video gave refund .
i am
so glad i did not spend 10 buck
watching this fiasco in the theater .
if they have been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century ,
it makes me wonder
how many person over the age have had their best nap during this work .
if i had been there ,
they would not have hear the play over the snoring .
thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd player ;
you can skip past the boring or awful scene .
guess
that means i only watched the beginning and the end !
