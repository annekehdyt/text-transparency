this film was not programmed in italian cinemas ,
i have seen it at a manifestation
called `` fantafestival '' .i find it terrible
because some scene seems like music video chaotic and dark ,
the use of fluorescent color is ridicule
and there is no suspence in the film .
music is completely out of the story
and i do not have word
to describe the visual effects.if you look at the first scene
the film seems to be interesting ,
but a few minute later it becomes busy.the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .
