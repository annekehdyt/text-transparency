following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy
that having her character
simultaneously operate both within
and without the context
the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism
that sitcom could really use .
the supporting character ground the show in a sitcom reality
which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah 's erratic persona
which 
beyond general insensitivity 
has no specific recurring trait for behavioural expectation
to be based on ,
making her less a character than a canvas
to be repainted in every episode if not scene .
sarah 's ability
to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspect of social behaviour
that are subtle enough
to usually go unnoticed .
every time she speaks
it is like a self-contained 5 second skit .
she overemotes a lot 
demonstrating the countless thing a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify ,
but never stick with one idea long enough
for you to get comfortable and form expectation
that will be satisfied .
this may be the most creative 
original and experimental tv program ever .
