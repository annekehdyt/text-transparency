if you have not seen this yet ,
i say just move on 
take a walk in the park ,
do not waste your time .
neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money .
*spoilers*- i can not decide
which was worse :
the movie itself or baldwin 's hairstyle ?
ellen pompeo 's acting talent is very questionable i hope
she can improve it over time .
the storyline is just unbelievable .
loose cannon american cop fighting criminal in europe on his own ? ?
infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunk ? ? ?
an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ? ? ?
spanish polouse executive dumber than a sack of hammer ? ? ?
give me a eak .
there is only one good thing about this movie 
though :
at least 
the production cost must be lower than `` ocean 's 12 '' 's
which was as meaningless and over the top as this one .
