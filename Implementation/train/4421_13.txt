simple 
meaningful and deliver an emotional punch .
i regularly trail through dull short film
and it is always nice to come across something
that has a simple and enlightened message ,
without pretension or self indulgent directing.a boy at school has to attend a lesson
when his friend plays truant and is given the most important lesson of his life ,
only to find that when there are not enough copy
to go around
he has to share with the school bully.unlike most short film featuring child
or actor these kid hold their own
and it is believable .
the soundtrack nicely complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well .
