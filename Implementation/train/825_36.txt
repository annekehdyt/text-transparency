of course 
by any normal standard of film criticism 
soldier is a very poor film indeed .
kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier
raised since birth
to kill but then made obsolete
after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldier at a dangly hoop ruck
that looks a bit like a gladiator contest
without the crash mats.abandoned on a junk planet ,
he is befriended by a community of naff space hippie
that teach him about gardening 
family life and 
um 
east .
kurt does not talk much .
finally the really super soldier turn up
and kill the hippie
by shooting them in the back
while they are running away .
kurt gets angry and kills everyone .
a planet gets totalled .
the end.unless the academy start a new category for `` best explosion '' ,
soldier is not going to win any award .
however ,
as ludicrous as it is ,
it remains an enjoyable experience .
the military hardware is the coolest since alien
( the apc 's especially )
and 
at 90 minute long 
it does not outstay its welcome .
please note
that the below mark is only a guide .
knock five point off
if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more
if you do not like miniguns.7/10
