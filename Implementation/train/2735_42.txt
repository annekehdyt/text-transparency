i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto 
a short film festival in guanajuato 
mexico .
one of the producer was there
and gave a ief introduction .
the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed :
one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white.i should not go on with the detail 'cause i think
it is a film worth seeing .
the sci-fi story might be found average for many ...
to me was really good .
the action is great ,
the camera is free
to fly everywhere
and i mean everywhere .
thing you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully .
the cast performance is good ,
in my opinion no one hits the wrong note.now ,
the thing
that i found awesome
is the animation .
3d grafic look 2d .
a bw comic book ought to life .
the detail on the background gives more texture
as if it had been done by hand
( i am sure
it was but when the angle change you see the depth ) .
the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film :
7 year !
the director ,
she said ,
is illiant ,
but perhaps he was quite unexperienced
since he only had one short film in his cv .
so 
many person had true faith in them .
they started their own studio from scratch and ever
since they faced the challenge
they ought upon them.do not miss it .
i think
you will not regret it ...
maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film
is superior to his i think .
