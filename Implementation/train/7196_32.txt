ok hollywood is not liberal.obviously i am lieing
because it is .
im a conservative but the politic i will leave out of my opinion of the movie .
this movie was anti bush 
anti middle east 
anti big oil propaganda
but that is not why
it was bad.fist off i
will give credit
where credit is due .
i saw this film opening night
because i happen to like these kind of film
and am a political science major in collage .
the cinematography was excellent
and the acting was as far
as i could tell very good.the plot was impossible for me to decode however .
i have been tested
and have an iq of 138 but no matter
how hard i tried there was no way
i could piece together the story line of the movie and what character
where doing what.the story and scene sequence
was totally incoherent
and poorly organized.unless this is one of those movie
that is meant to be watch many time
to get the full depth pf the story ,
which it very well may be ,
i have no idea
exactly what was going on.which makes sense
because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism
then make your argument impossible to critique !
if you can not dazzle them with illiance ,
then baffle them with bull s .
