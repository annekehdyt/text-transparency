the king is dead long live the king !
the triad of caddie shack two 
the family underneath the stair ,
and troop beverly hill had been tied for worst movie ever for so long
that they seemed icon in their own right .
but there is a new king ... ..yep ...
..all hail the new king ... . ''
down to earth '' .
but some thing 
like tiny tim for example 
are so
bad they are good .
some day this could take out the inimitable `` rocky horror picture show '' as a cult film .
so go see this ... .this ...
.well just take my word for it .
go see it .
all hail the new king !
