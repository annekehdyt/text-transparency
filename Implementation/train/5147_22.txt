i read the back of the box
and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron .
i thought 
`` wonderful !
this will be great ! ''
i was so wrong .
the story was all screwed up .
in fact i still do not get it .
it just seems to me that all the character did was drink 
smoke
( opium ? )
and have sex .
not that those are not good movie quality 
but please !
where was the story ?
i made myself finish the movie ,
and yes ,
it did pick up toward the end ,
but by then the movie was almost over .
rent it
if you really want to .
just do not trust the back of the box .
