once again 
like charlie 's angel 
inspector gadget and thunderbird 
a tv series is turned into a full length film
and gets ruined for all the hundred of person
that watched .
basically the duke cousin 
luke
( johnny knoxville )
and bo
( seann william scott )
in hazzard county ,
spend a lot of time
driving very fast in `` the general lee '' .
but they need to get their act together
and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty jefferson davis 'boss ' hogg
( razzie nominated burt reynold )
to make way for a huge coal mine .
they get help along the way from their sexy cousin daisy
( razzie nominated jessica simpson )
and uncle jesse
( willie nelson ) ,
while being chased by equally mean sheriff rosco p. coltrane
( lost 's m.c .
gainey )
and the police .
also starring joe don baker as governor jim applewhite 
jack polick as deputy cletus hogg 
david koechner as cooter davenport 
michael weston
as deputy enos strate and lynda carter as pauline .
i think
the only reason
i give the film an extra star
is because of a couple of impressive car stunt 
and of course the gorgeous body of simpson
( i will admit her leg
are not quite catherine bach ,
but still !
) ,
but besides that it is pretty boring .
it was nominated the razzy for worst picture 
worst director for jay chandrasekhar 
worst remake or sequel 
worst screen couple for simpson and her `` daisy duke '' and worst screenplay .
pretty poor !
