when i saw this film in the 1950s ,
i wanted to be a scientist too .
there was something magical and useful in science .
i took a girl - friend along
to see it a second time .
i do not think
she was as impressed as i was !
this film was comical yet serious 
at a time
when synthetic fy were rather new .
lesson from this film could be applied to issue
relating to gm experimentation of today .
