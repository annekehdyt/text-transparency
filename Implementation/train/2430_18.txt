evidently
when you offer a actor enough money
they will do anything .
i am not sure
how much john rys-dave got ,
but most of the money
he made
should go to his fan as an apology for even
being associated with such a rotten movie .
the special effect were worse
then effect from the 1950 's b movie
and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse .
as to how bad the acting was a child
gave the second best performance in my opinion .
the english was terribly accented and i think
no one could really even speak english
they just memorized how the word should sound instead of memorizing the script
and trying to make their character both `` life-like '' and real .
