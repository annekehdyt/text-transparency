jonathan river
( michael keaton )
suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dy .
soon after 
he is approached by a dr. price 
an expert in electronic voice phenomena
( evp ) ,
who claims
he is been receiving message from jonathan 's departed wife anna via sundry electronic gadget .
is anna trying to tell jonathan something ?
is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale ?
it is good to see keaton in a leading role ,
but the story he is stuck with is convoluted and absurd at point ;
it is as if the movie does not know how to answer any of the question
it ings up ,
so it just distracts the viewer with new ,
unrelated question.keaton himself is pretty good 
convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife .
he is matured quite a bit as an actor ,
leaving behind the frat-friendly waacky-hijink role
he played 15 or so year earlier .
he looks a little craggy 
with a perhaps few more wrinkle than one might expect ,
but he is lost none of the guile and panache
that he is shown during his quarter century in hollywood.so
it is not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance ,
it is that the script itself is subpar .
written by niall johnson ,
the plot gets more confusing
as it progresses ,
each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path .
this is all well
and good
if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement ,
something
that ties more or less everything together
and explain ... something .
but not white noise ; i knew less about what had happened to jonathan than i did
before i would first seen him.keaton 's really the only reason to watch this junk ,
although he gets fine support from ian mcneice
( as dr. price )
and deborah kara unger as the requisite love interest .
