a give this movie a 10/10
because it deserves a 10/10 .
two of the best actor of their time-walter matthau and george burn collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actor
that are in this film + director herbert ross ,
and all of that makes this stage adaption come true .
the sunshine boys is one of the best film of the 70 's .
i love the type of humor in this film ,
it just makes me laugh
so hard.i got this movie on vhs 3 day ago
( yes 
vhs
because it was cheaper-only $ 3 ) .
i watched it as soon
as i got home ,
but i had to watch it again
because i kept missing a few part the first time .
the second time i watched it ,
it felt a lot better ,
and i laughed a lot harder .
i am definitely going to re-get this on dvd
because i have to see the special features.it is very funny how that happens .
two person work together as entertainers/actor/performers .
they get along well on stage ,
but really argue off stage ,
they can not survive another minute with each other ,
then some 15 year later ,
you want to reunite them for a tv special .
you can find that in this film .
matthau and burn were terrific in this film .
it is a damn shame
they died .
george burn deserved that oscar .
he gave a strong comic performance .
he was also 78
when this movie was filmed .
so far 
he is the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age .
jessica tandy eaks the record as the oldest actress .
richard benjamin was also fantastic in this .
he won a golden globe for best supporting actor .
he deserved that golden globe .
although many person might disagree with what i am about to say ,
everybody in this film gave a strong performance .
this comedy is an instant classic .
i highly recommend it .
one more thing :
whoever hates this film is a `` putz ''
