i am not sure
who is writing theseglowing review for this movie
but trust me it stkinks .
i have seen hundred of horror film and slasher flick and this one is lame
it is only about 80min long
and believe me
that is all i could take .
plot is terrible ,
acting is even worse .
and there is no development
at all.even the david cocteau film are better than this .
run away from jigsaw .
i expected to hate the acting ,
which can be forgiven in direct to video movie ,
if the plot is good.this had no scare ,
very little gore 
and a truly unattractive cast.i watched this with three other friendswho i hope are still talking to me !
they wanted me to fling the disc out the window .
i can not believe
anyone could havegiven this tripe a good review .
