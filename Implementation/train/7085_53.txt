sitting on the front porch of his burbank home ,
ted mape told me
that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat.ted 
one of the greatest of the stunt man ,
said
that every time zorro put on his mask ,
he was the one on the screen.that was a little bit of an exaggeration :
there were time
that zorro was obviously reed hadley ,
but in the stunt we can be satisfied
it was ted at work.and what stunt !
`` zorro 's fighting legion '' is ,
as witness the commants here 
one of the greatest of serial .
it is exciting
and generally very well made.reed hadley was a fine actor ,
and 
as someone else commanted ,
he made a very good fop.but 
admittedly 
it is the action that makes this movie so great.and what else could we expect 
with direction by that excellent team 
witney and english 
with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava
( the listing here says
he was uncredited ,
but that is incorrect ;
those other composer listed here were indeed uncredited ,
and i do not know
if they did write any of the music
-- it sounds like lava ) ,
and with villainy from 
among other 
the great charle king 
and with dozen of bit part ? also noteworthy was a villain
played by the radio tarzan 
jim pierce ,
who was edgar rice burrough ' son-in-law .
( i urge you to read his mini-bio . )
there is one chapter
that slows thing down depressingly ,
but 
heck 
it is only a few minute long
( maybe 20 )
and
when you wade through it ,
well 
you are back to the excitemant.turner classic movie deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial ,
and we should ask tcm to ing us more.and we should thank everyone involved
that we get to see it as a chapter-play 
or serial ,
and not as a re-cut feature .
