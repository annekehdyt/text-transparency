yes 
chunky 
this is the nick-name
that donna reed ' romantic lead
played by tom drake tags her with !
so lets get this clear right away .
from her first ing\u00e9nue role in the get-away
( 1941 )
too her last 
dallas
( 1984-1985 )
ms. reed could never be described as chunky .
not this attractive and slim actress .
whose role at m.g.m .
seldom lived up to her talents.ms .
reed is supported by a cast of competent character actor ,
who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball ' comedy .
clearly m.g.m .
was out of their depth
making this type of film .
a type better produced over at columbia 
paramount 
rko and even universal .
neither the 'touch ' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturge could save this film .
a rather conventional romantic comedy
that had all the marking of a pre-war
( wwii )
effort.if irving thalberg had still been alive
the screen-play would have either gone through a significan
not rewrite or never seen the light of day .
it did fit into louis b. mayer 's 'safe-zone ' of none
challenging family entertainment .
a form
that could not stand up to the post-war challenge of the 'dehavilland decision ' 
loss of their theater chain 
television
and would contribute to m.g.m.s decline .
fortunetly for donna reed her best day are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity
( 1953 )
and her oscar win as best supporting actress .
