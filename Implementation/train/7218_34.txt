bunny comes home 'this man 's navy ' deserve more credit
than it gets 
a clever script by borden chase ,
directed by 'wild bill ' wellman ,
the film has just the right feel for early post ww11 euphoria and goodwill 
and none of the blind terror
that came into play few year later .
produced in 1944 ,
the japanese defeated 
the battle scenes a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ,
tom drake 's melancholy attraction for radiant young jan clayton has solid chemistry 
play real and validate drake 's career at metro .
the following year jan opened on broadway in 'carousel . '
wally beery 
a little bleary-eyed 
boasts to an always incredulous jimmy gleason his memory an improvement over reality ,
and give beery a ulysses-like shadow to play against .
the navy lta
( lighter than air )
shot are authentic 
photographed at tustin and lakehurst ,
and the p-38 squadron is out of march afb .
lot 3 doubled for india ,
and bunny 's u-turn bunny comes home gives back to beery an authentic slice of his past ,
something
he had wanted to believe was true then ,
the future
we spin into again
is fantastical now on a grander scale 
a newly designed navy lta with launch capability for a reconnaissance plane how expensive 
blissfully optimistic still ,
`` you got to believe in it ,
that is the way
you make thing come true ''
