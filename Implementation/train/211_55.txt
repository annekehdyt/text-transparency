let 's start this review out on a positive note
-- i
am very glad they did not decide to wimp out with tony being shot
and do a retrospective season like some person were rumoring .
actually 
creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite .
we do not actually know
if tony will live or die .
he is in a coma
and his chance of recovering are very slim to none .
this episode seemed to move very slow ,
and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity
and robed asian monk slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely 
flat-out weird .
after 45-minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving ,
but that shouldn ' t be a reason to slam this episode .
it was a weird and unpredictable episode ,
but it was still well-written and intense .
edie falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife
having to face with her husband 's could-be demise .
i also found
it interesting aj dropped out of school
and swore a vendetta against junior ,
which aj most likely will not have the ball
to pull off .
silvio is now acting-boss
which opens numerous door to problem in later episode .
there were a lot of great quip in this episode 
also ,
and i think
vito 'pole-smoker ' spadafore may meet his demise
if
he keeps
being a greedy s.o.b.this
was not a great episode
and disappointed
only
because even though tony kill person ,
we as an audience adore him
and feel
he is our hero of the show .
this was a necessary episode for the series ,
even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion .
kudos to edie falco 's performance 
and david chase and the writer
for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist .
this is the only season of 'the sopranos '
where i have not a f*cking clue
where it is going to go .
i can not wait for next week 's episode .
my rating :
7.5/10 best line of the episode :
( paulie to aj ) :
`` let 's go ,
van helsing ! ''
