ok 
let me again admit
that i have not seen any other merchant ivory
( the distributor ) film .
nor have i seen more celeated work by the director ,
so my capacity
to discuss
before the rain outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated .
with that admittance 
let me begin.before the rain is a different kind of movie
that does not know
which genre it wants to be .
at first 
it pretends to be a romance .
in most romance 
the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character ,
is separated from the supporting character ,
and is ( sometimes ) united with his or her partner .
this movie 's hero has already won the heart of his lover
but can not be with her .
his name is henry moore
and her name is sajani ,
and they reside in southern india during the waning day of the raj
( british imperial rule ) .
henry has been away from london for a long time
and has fallen in love with his married indian maid ,
despite his legal marriage and child overseas .
what could be better than that ?
they often sneak away for intimate afternoon until some child notice them .
word spreads to sajani 's husband
who question her involvement with moore .
she denies any contact with him ,
but moore asks her to leave the area .
sajani refuses
because of her devotion to him and commit suicide .
please take note
that these event occur in the opening third of the film .
the film change tone
and become a crime-drama in its final portions.sajani 's body is discovered right
as moore ' family comes to visit .
the alleged perpetrator is moore 's english-educated assistant t.k .
t.k .
know of his master 's affair
but keeps silent until his life become threatened .
once he is declared innocent ,
he attempts to regain his honor by killing moore .
t.k .
is too squeamish
and leaves him in a dirt path
as the rain fall.i want to warn you ,
this is not a romance film .
the dvd cover and theatrical poster show an indian woman and caucasian man emacing in an idealized tropic setting .
this image is captured directly from the film 's opening ,
but quickly disappear .
then it is over .
it seems like an effort
to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love .
it is not effective 
at all .
not only is the movie not a romance ,
but its character lack any personality .
they are bundle of walking clich\u00e9s .
moore is an arrogant white man
who does not recognize his indian friend 
t.k .
's intelligence .
t.k .
is torn between his own heritage and his educative background .
sajani is a woman incapable
of having a choice in her romantic life .
oh 
and 
of course 
moore ' family is inquisitive into sajani 's death but still slightly racist to indian .
if the tone was not so serious ,
i would be willing to overlook these problem ,
but it is not .
the film is presented with a didactic overtone
which highlights its poor character development.no ,
this film is not terrible .
other than the laughable screenplay 
it is not poor .
the actor are all experienced
and perform well here .
nandita das ,
who plays sajani ,
was part of wonderful indian drama water .
even director sivan has an impressive resume .
he recently oversaw the terrorist ,
which is part of roger ebert 's `` great movie '' collection .
what happened here ?
why is this movie so bad ?
well 
sivan mentioned
how he was inspired to direct this film
because of a short he viewed in israel
called red roofs .
apparently 
the story was `` timeless 
''
and sivan sought to create a similar experience
set in 1930 's india .
i do not have any problem with that approach ,
but i think
sivan may have been too motivated this time .
the actor 
cinematography 
and set design are acceptable
but unless you share sivan 's aura ,
you will probably not enjoy it .
my recommendation is that you presume you are not in accordance with him and watch something else .
final consensus :
*and \u00bd out of *****
