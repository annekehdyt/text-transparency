the zombie chronicle aspect ratio :
1.33:1
( nu-view 3-d )
sound format :
monowhilst
searching for a ( literal )
ghost town in the middle of nowhere 
a young reporter
( emmy smith )
picks up a grizzled hitchhiker
( joseph haggerty )
who tells her two story
involving flesh-eating zombie
reputed to haunt the area.an absolute waste of time 
hobbled from the outset by haggerty 's painfully amateurish performance in a key role .
worse still 
the two story
which make up the bulk of the running time
are utterly routine ,
made worse by indifferent performance and lackluster direction by brad syke ,
previously responsible for the like of camp blood
( 1999 ) .
this is not a 'fun ' movie in the sense
that ed wood 's movie are 'fun '
( he 
at least 
believed in what he was doing
and was sincere in his effort ,
despite a lack of talent ) ;
syke ' home-made movie are 
in fact 
aggravating 
boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue ,
and most viewer will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative 
badly-conceived junk .
the 3-d format is utterly wasted here .
