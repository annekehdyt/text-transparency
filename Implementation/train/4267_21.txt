i figured
that any horror film with orson welle in it would be weird .
necromancy sure was
but it was a little too weird
for it is own good .
the film does indeed have a creepy feel
as it deals with a coven of satanists/witch in a small town and a young woman 's attempt
to escape them .
the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience
by using flashback and dream sequence .
by the finale 
there are too many unanswered question .
what is worse ,
as the story is so confusing ,
it is pretty hard to root for any of the character .
it seems odd
that welle would agree to headline this film
especially since he does not have that much to do .
maybe someday
they will put out a tape of the outtake and blooper from this movie .
now that would really be fun !
