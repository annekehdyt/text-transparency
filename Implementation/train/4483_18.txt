first off i would like to point out
that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film .
what is a movie
without sam niel .
did anyone see event horizon .
d-war did have potential a movie about a dragon
that controls lizard with rocket launcher does sound cool
but sadly is not .
nope 
no sam niel 
no good movie .
i recommend taking the 5 dollar
or so it takes to rent d-war
and adding 10 to that five
and buying a sam niel film-
apparently to submit this i
have to have ten line of text
so heres a list of sam niel movie i recommend-jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red october -event horizon -not jurassic park threeoverall d-war is a pile
