legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest film in his historic career in this very tense ,
and ultimately shocking story about a family
that includes dysfunctional as one of the child .
with an a-list cast
headed by philip seymour hoffman
( an oscar-worthy performance here ) ,
ethan hawke 
marisa tomei and albert finney 
lumet has captured not just element of botched crime story such as reservoir dog ,
but also family story such as ordinary people.many viewer might be confused
and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here .
instead of showing it in a linear manner ,
he has gone the tarantino route
and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different point of view all out of order .
i personally found this
to be very satisfying
and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next .
the script is very strong with some excellent scene between husband and wife hoffman and tomei 
as well as between father and son finney and hoffman .
all the actor are totally engaging to watch
and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually does not delve in .
plenty of action and suspense
to hold the audience for the two hour running time ,
this is a rare movie
that does not disappoint for one moment .
