you probably all already know this by now ,
but 5 additional episode never aired can be viewed on abc.com i have watched a lot of television over the year
and this is possibly my favorite show 
ever .
it is a crime
that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled .
the actor
that played laura 
whit 
carlos 
mae 
damian 
anya and omg 
steven caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those role .
even the kid are great .
wonderful show .
so sad that it is gone .
of course i wonder about the reason
it was canceled .
there is no way
i will let myself believe
that ms. moynahan 's pregnancy had anything to do with it .
it was in the perfect time slot in this market .
i have watched all the episode again on abc.com - i hope
they all come out on dvd some day .
thank for reading .
