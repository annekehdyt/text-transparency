this movie is great .
simply .
it is rare that you find a comedy with level ,
and this is a bloody good example of such .
when i saw this movie first ,
as the credit rolled ,
a friend and i looked to one another and asked ...
'did you just catch that ? '
for those doubter 
look at the level .
see the comparison between vick and the person in the club 
the dna !
see the diverse character 
each jostling for position ,
and if you see nothing else ,
see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film .
it is all in vick 's head !
the opening line about vick 's world .
the closing scene with the camera going into vick 's head 
and inside 
a whole universe !
thoroughly quotable 
wonderful cartoon gangster 
beautiful 
beautiful 
beautiful !
