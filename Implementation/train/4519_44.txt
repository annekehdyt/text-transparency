zp is deeply related to that youth dream
represented by the hippie movemant.the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation
that gives birth to that movemant .
the explosion
that daria imagine ,
represents the fall of all social structure
and therefore the developmant of all
that huge transformation
that society is suffering through
and finally mark 's death anticipates the end
that a see for the movemant itself .
the film will be more easily understood
if we go back to that time in life .
during the 60 ' and 70 ' 
young person were the driving force for the profound exploration for change .
one of the more significan not change intended was to ing sexuality out of the closet ,
and i think
the scene in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship
that man and woman in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation
where there would be nobody to hide from .
i watched the scene
where the couple would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way
in which a depicted the impossibility
to continue hiding this basic human instinct .
repression was the way to 'control ' social outburst at that time
and that is the method ,
police apply to stop the student .
this society suffer from hipocresy ,
and that comes clear
when the student gain access to weapon skipping all fake control .
the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor ,
who 's detained for no reason shows part of society
interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested .
presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom ,
the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but 
his
( going back or coming back or returning
( segun ) )
shows the difficulty
to come free from these bond
and as i ' ve said 
a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulty
winning the game .
in my point of view a film to remember .
