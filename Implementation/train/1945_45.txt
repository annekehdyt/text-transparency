yokai monster :
spook warfare
( yokai daisenso 
2005 )
a movie about `` yokai '' or traditional japanese `` monster '' of folklore .
it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghost on parade.the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak 
kappa water imp 
a living 'ella 
a woman
whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic 
a woman with a second face on the back of her head 
a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist ,
and so on.these sort of whimsical monster derive not only from fairy lore 
but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era 
comparable to today 's halloween haunted house 
or the `` freak show '' of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freak .
ghost and goldfish monster and dancing one-headed umella were trumped up
to create `` chill '' during the hot summer .
the fatcheek woman and such were recreated by trick or illusion ,
based on monster depicted in medieval scroll ;
and
if their design for the movie is a bit simple and hoky ,
this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chill.these rather endearing monster have to face off
and destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon
who has come to japan and disguised himself as a samurai lord .
despite that some of the japanese apparition are a bit goofy ,
and too many of the costume scarsely more than mask
without even moving lip
as they speak ,
it is all played very poker-faced
and is very charming .
it has some beautiful cinematography ,
much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade .
viewed in the right mood or with the right friend ,
it is exciting ,
moving and touching.yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf and cub :
white heaven and hell
( 1974 )
andand was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy .
the yokai monster series is not the equal of majin at its best ,
but the yokai are nevertheless great fun .
the first miike movie
which is the most child-oriented of his family film ,
with the gozu and izoo consecutively more serious
though none too severe for young viewer .
