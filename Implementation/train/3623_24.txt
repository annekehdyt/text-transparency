i usually enjoy loretta young 's early movie :
her acting back then was light and eezy ,
and she sure
knew how to wear clothe .
but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny
supporting turn by glenda farrell .
young is a hatcheck girl
who talks her writer-husband
( paul lukas )
into becoming a championship idge player .
it is not the most cinematic of game 
and the long 
talky middle part
in which their marriage falls apart
just about kill the film.there is one interesting bit though .
as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game ,
a series of quick shot show airplane 
train 
football game 
even a diver in mid-air 
freezing in anticipation of the event .
it is the earliest use of a freeze frame i
have seen in an american film .
wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny .
