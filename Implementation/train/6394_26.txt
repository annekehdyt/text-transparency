care bear movie 2 :
a new generation is not at all a bad movie .
in fact 
i like it very much .
yes i admit
the dialogue is corny
and the story is a bit poorly told at time .
but darkheart ,
while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain ,
and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him .
speaking of the voice acting ,
it was great ,
nothing wrong with it whatsoever .
the animation is colourful ,
and some of the visual particularly at the beginning were eathtaking .
the song and score are lovely 
especially growing up and forever young ,
the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two .
the care bear ,
who i do like ,
are adorable ,
and the human child are well done too .
and the ending is a real tearjerker .
all in all 
harmless kiddie fun .
