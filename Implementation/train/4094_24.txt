this is so exciting !
after i saw `` la roue '' this afternoon 
a short 
light-hearted little movie ,
i consider this one a real treat !
this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming picture i saw this year .
it is the more amazing
since it is an early talkie
and puts some great picture of the 30 's to shame
due to its innovative use of sound in cinema .
it is simply filled with music and an adorable mood
that is really upbeat and 
bottom line ,
it made me happy !
obviously it would not be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket
the male lead was looking for ,
but the pace is so exhilarating
and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining
that i did not even think of it twice .
the comedy is many time hilarious
and i think
it is even superior to the marx brother 
possibly the biggest comedic force of the time .
this is rather perfect .
