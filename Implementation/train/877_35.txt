this is one of the funniest movie
i
have seen .
i watched it on dvd ,
and the disc does not have any special feature 
or even a menu ,
but that is not necessarily what i care about .
i tend to judge movie on a case by case basis ,
depending on 
among other thing ,
if it is a big studio production or a smaller film .
this is a smaller film
and i am willing to forgive minor thing .
that said ,
i believe
it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequence
that i have seen.i enjoyed the acting of all of the major player .
i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin .
alan arkin has most of the funniest line .
the character
portrayed by claire forlani
might come across as unrealistic to some person ,
but i have personally known real person with emotional problem
that very readily look at life 's decision as her character does .
that helped me pick up the nuance
where her hurt could come out through the veneer of her humor.this is not a movie for child 
obviously ,
but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity .
there is quite a bit of adult language 
though ,
but it can sometimes be very funny .
( in particular 
alan arkin 's character ,
who can not even swear correctly .
) also watch for the cameos from known character actor .
