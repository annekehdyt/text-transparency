what do you expect
when there is no script
to begin with ,
and therefore nothing
that the director can work with .
hayek and farrell 
and donaldson and kirkin are good actor ,
they just do not have anything to say or anything
to react to .
even the earthquake was pretty poor .
and i do not know
how closely the movie follows the novel ,
but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show
that arturo has a nice 
warm heart ,
but some stereotype do not amount to anything .
and he even buries camilla out in the desert ,
instead of inging her back to l.a. for a nice catholic burial
where he could at least ing her flower once in a while .
pathetic .
and the l.a. set was ridiculously graphically created .
anything good ?
the window to his apartment felt real 
the curtain 
the sound 
the wind .
and donaldson is always great .
has been since the body snatcher or night of the living dead ,
whichever it was .
