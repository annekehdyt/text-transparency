black and white film .
good photography .
believable character .
just awful.i have wasted another perfect evening
watching a film
that other rated as `` worthy '' and `` very good . ''
there is some good acting here
and the back ground setting for the plot is good
( more should have been done with this )
but it is very slow to grow
and never develop .
it is totally basis on sex
without much romance with much un needed nudity .
more could have been done with the main character .
if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if
not you will have trouble
sitting through it .
though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep !
