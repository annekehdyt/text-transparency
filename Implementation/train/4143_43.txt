i saw this film at the toronto film festival ,
where it received a standing ovation !
this film tells a story
that to my knowledge has never been told before
-- namely about the rosenstrasse
( a street in berlin )
uprising of german gentile woman
who were married to jew at the end of the second world war .
as such 
it is a unique story ,
and what is more ,
is the only film about the holocaust
that i have ever seen that shows
that there were good german
( the helping family in `` anne frank '' for instance was dutch )
who did not support the nazis ,
and 
in fact 
had the fortitude
to stand up against their own country 's immorality and utality during the nazi regime 
at the risk of their very lives .
the acting is great across the board 
the framing story in new york interesting and intricate 
the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene 
and the production value ,
including the gorgeous cinematography 
outstanding .
of course the family in new york could be speaking german .
many immigrant in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family
-- a common occurrence .
so that criticism is unwarranted .
to say
more would spoil the experience .
the film is long ,
but i did not look at my watch once .
i am hoping
this film gets some distribution is north america ,
for not only is this film a masterpiece ,
but it can actually help heal any animosity person have towards the german
because of their support of hitler .
if this film is playing in your area ,
i urge you to see it !
you will be glad you did !
