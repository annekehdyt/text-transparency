i have never read the bradbury novel
that this movie is based on but from what i have gathered ,
it will be interesting
( when i finally do read it and i will ) .
my comment will be based purely on the film .
as soon as i saw the trailer i knew
i had to see it
and was so excited
but
when i finally did ,
i was so disappointed it hurt .
this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish .
the actor were not well cast
( though robard and pryce are both good actor - just not here ) .
the kid actor ,
it seemed ,
were merely asked to show up 
get in the character ' clothe ,
say the line
and make the faces .
the set and prop were cheap and unrealistic .
the direction was surprisingly bad .
i was so surprised at the awfulness of it
that i had to go online and check
who directed it ,
just to see the kind of work
he had done .
the editing was cut and paste and the plot
( screenplay )
was just that as well
( even though the author had been involved himself 
irony ? ) .
the building up of the tension 
fear and suspense was so mild
it was ineffective
when the climax finally came.i have read some of the comment on this movie
and find it hard to believe person actually like it .
what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing .
it had so much potential .
unfortunately 
the film was so technically bad
it takes away from the illiance of the story .
