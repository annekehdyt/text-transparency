the broken is part of the after dark horrorfest iii .
not a slasher or filled with gore .
plenty of oken glass and mirror in this edgy thriller from france and writer/director sean ellis .
a successful radiologist gina mcvay
( lena headly )
inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control .
while attending her father 's
( richard jenkin )
birthday party 
the guest are stunned
when a mirror crash to the floor for no obvious reason .
thing get really strange
when she witnesses a woman
that is the spitting image
of herself driving down a london street in a car identical to her own .
gina sneak to her doppelganger 's apartment
and finds a photo of herself with her father .
she drives away
and is involved in a head on collision .
then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same ;
to be exact family
and friend are not easy for her to trust .
is gina beside herself ?
is she in a parallel world ?
her nightmare become more horrific ... is she oken ?
kudos
if you can figure this one out ...
it will not be easy .
editing could not be any tighter .
lighting is questionable .
