i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child
softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian .
i have seen enough of them \u0097 baby boom 
kolya 
about a boy 
mostly martha 
and to some extent 
whale rider \u0097 to expect to be bored by the formula .
what held my attention in the king of mask was the grimness of the setting :
small-town china in the 1930 's .
extreme poverty was the norm ,
and girl child were considered so worthless to poor parent
that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market .
when wang discovers his purchased grandson ,
whom he is nicknamed `` doggie 
''
is a granddaughter ,
he initially casts her out ,
even though she is showed great promise as street-performing heir .
even after he reluctantly takes her back ,
he is not too upset
when she is kidnapped .
the film is gritty then ,
showing the length
to which a young ,
street-smart girl had to go
to survive in that society.the two lead performance are believable and beguiling in their societal context .
in a western society 
one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success .
wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celeated artist with low societal status 
though ,
that i did 
too .
while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning
that would be suspect in a modern 
suburban child ,
it is completely believable in the context of a kid
constantly in survival mode in a society
that treats poor girl like garbage .
and after learning
that her previous seven owner have physically
and mentally abused her ,
her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense.the peek at small-town life in a foreign country 
the naturalness of the two lead actor 
the surprising plot twist 
and of course 
the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .
