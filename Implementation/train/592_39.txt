hawked as the most offensive movie ever ,
guaranteed to offend everyone- guess what ?
it worked ,
i am offended
that we shelled out money to rent this .
two friend and i were bored
and decided to see if all
that bull about the movie
that we saw on tv
was true .
curse comedy central and all the other network
that pushed this garbage on us !
it was by far the worst movie i
have seen since hollow man .
i generally avoid the crappy one ,
but got sucked into this one .
we have since beaten the prick
who suggest
we rent it ,
and his movie picking privilege have been revoked .
there is nothing remotely funny about this movie ...
even the `` adventure of dickman '' scene was sophomoric at best.. color me p***ed .
thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason ...
no..it just sucked .
never watch this !
for any reason whatsoever .
not even with copious amount of illegal substance would this movie be funny .
that is saying alot .
please for the love of all
that is holy ,
if you cherish your sanity-
never view this movie .
it is many things- stupid 
pointless 
and worthless to name a few .
but the main thing it was aiming for :
offensively funny-
it failed miserably .
crash and burn ... .
