i watched this film
without knowing anything about it whatsoever
and found it similar thematically to billy elliott
( 2000 ) .
both film are based around a troubled father/son relationship .
in both film 
the son does not want to follow his father down the mine and dream of a better life away from their home town .
both son face derision by their classmate
and both have a strong female role model
who teaches them.the major difference
that i found between the film
was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film .
laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well
as he went on to do in american beauty
( 1999 ) .
joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing 
very different from his other directorial feature such as jumanji
( 1995 )
and jurassic park iii
( 2001 ) .
