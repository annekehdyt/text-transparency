i could not believe
how awful this film was ;
i rarely watch commercial tv ,
but thought `` well 
diane keaton is always worth watching '' .
i stand corrected .
everyone involved should be hanging their head in shame.i realize
there are not a lot of great role for woman of a certain age ,
but the script to this was so inept 
clich\u00e9d and baffling
that i am surprised
it ever got into development
or that ms. keaton thought
she could make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear .
none of the character had a shred of believability
and were so incredibly unlikeable .
the acting looked like exercise in a beginning class - i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering
`` what were they thinking ? `` .
very 
very sad
that it has come to this .
do not waste your time .
