inspired at least a little by ivy benson and her all girl orchestra ,
who performed throughout the war year at the covent garden opera house ,
this film chronicles the attempt by an elderly saxophone player
to reform the
( almost )
all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of wwii .
all too ief flashback to the original band on stage ing us some wonderful music ,
and help to fill in the background to the band member ,
and in particular to the girl ' relationship with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer
( who is trying to dodge the call-up )
.ian holm
( `` lord of the ring '' 
`` cromwell and fairfax '' )
and judi dench turn in superb leading performance as the recently widowed elizabeth 
and the conniving 
womanizing patrick 
the drummer .
the late joan sim is perfect as the band 's leader ,
now playing bar piano at the sea-side 
and june whitfield glow as the salvation army trombone player .
cameo appearance by other great like cleo laine 
leslie caron 
olympia dukakis and billie whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience .
the movie is a romp down memory lane 
with an all star cast of what ought ,
by all right ,
to be a bunch of over-the-hill actress .
all i can say is ,
i hope i look as good at their age !
leslie caron 
in particular 
is still an incredible fox 
at 69 year of age .
she certainly still gets my pulse going !
as i watched it ,
i was mentally berating the casting director
for not using woman of the appropriate age .
afterward 
i looked these girl up ,
and discovered
that every one of them is old enough
to have been performing in the london of 1944
( although this might be a bit of a stretch for judi dench )
.if you like swing band ,
thrive on nostalgia ,
or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her ,
do not miss this film .
