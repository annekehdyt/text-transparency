admittedly 
i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure .
he was a fine actor until scent of a woman ,
where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably .
i hoped this film ,
of which i would heard almost nothing growing up ,
would be a nice little gem .
an overlooked 
ahead-of-its-time 
intelligent and engaging city-political thriller .
it is not.city hall is a movie
that clouds its plot with so many character 
name 
and `` realistic '' citywide issue ,
that for a while you think its a plot in scope so oad and implicating ,
that
once you find out the truth ,
it will blow your mind .
in truth 
however 
these subplot and digression result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademark such as corruption of power 
two-faced politician 
mafia with police ty 
etc .
and theoretically 
this setup allows for some thrilling tension 
the fear
that none of the character are safe ,
and anything could happen !
but again 
it really does not.unfortunately 
the only thing
that happen are quite predictable ,
and we are left with several `` confession '' monologue ,
that are meant as a whole
to form modern a fable of sort 
a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the `` real world '' of politic and society .
but after 110 minute of name and missing report and a spider-web of ly and cover-up 
the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal .
i do not think
we are left with that in city hall ,
and
while it is a very full film ,
i do not find it altogether rich .
