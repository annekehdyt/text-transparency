this was 
so far 
the worst movie i have seen in my entire life ,
and i have seen some really bad movie .
i saw this movie at my local video store ,
and the cover looked like
it could be a decent horror movie .
little did i know
that the cover would be the best part of the movie .
where to start ?
the filming of the movie was scattered and boring .
at one point 
there is a one-minute scene of no one talking ,
just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day .
nothing happened 
they just drove in silence .
the whole movie is boring 
with annoying 
unbelievable dialogue
and basically no plot to speak of .
if you rent this movie ,
watch it with some friend
and it might make a good comedy .
otherwise ,
when you see this movie 
run .
