nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing !
this time 
it is being ought to you by the never-inevitable fred olen ray !
as far as exploitation movie go ,
this one does not click !
as science fiction 
it is plain unoriginal !
all
that
we see
is an an ugly feminine android
wearing a bikini out
to destroy the earth ,
and showing off all
that is nearly bare to resist !
give me a f
-- -ing eak ! ! !
if this kind of entertainment is your thing ,
then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mag from the attic for a change ? !
this would have been much better
if it did not set the sleaze factor on very high ,
but that still would not make this one great .
i would like to point out another film
called the assault
( 1996 )
by jim wynorski ,
which resembles the identity of alienator .
it illustrates why top-notch 1st-person `` femme fatale '' action movie do not translate well in america .
sorry 
fellas !
