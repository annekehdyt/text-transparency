although george c. scott is the only actor in this version of acc
without a british accent ,
he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge.particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie 's end .
as scott stands before a large window ,
sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him ;
all you can see is his silhouette .
augmented by scott 's voice 
a ponderous growl ,
the effect is galvanizing ...
much like marlon brando 's first scene in apocalypse now .
`` the horror 
'' indeed !
however ,
as they say ,
the very thing
that works for you
can
also work against you .
because scott display such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie ,
it proves infectious .
to put it another way ,
the `` before '' scrooge is almost as charismatic as the `` after 
''
even though he really should not be .
it is what you might call the `` doctor smith '' effect ,
since jonathan harris used a very similar approach
when playing that role and numerous other heavy
( stage and screen alike )
.actually 
i myself do not consider scott 's glib rage a liability .
but other `` christma carol '' purist might .
see the film and judge for yourself .
