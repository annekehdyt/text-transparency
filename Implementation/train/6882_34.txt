being a big fan of corman 's horror movie i
expected from his western a bit more
than i got .
well 
i was entertained all right .
i had almost as many laugh
as watching mel brook ' blazing saddles.see the spectacle of mobile tire track on the prairie of the old west .
you can kill time
by counting them
if
there happens to be an otherwise boring scene
going on .
and the horse seem to have gear in them too ,
considered the fast-forward chase .
see also the swinging bar room queen of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number
that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920 's 
here decades before the style was invented .
hope
the saloon around them will not crumple.in the middle of all this mayhem
the main actor do a decent job .
ireland 
garland and haye are all truly fine .
a special praise for them
for doing the best
they could with the material
that seems mostly having been lifted from 'johnny guitar ' ,
but does not quite impress the same way .
but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this .
just like a really bad old horror movie ,
it might fail one way
but succeeds to give joy anyway .
that is one of the reason corman 's work appeal to me
and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie
if you get the chance .
