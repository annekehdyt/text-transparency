reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen
was a memorable one .
she appears like a fresh scrubbed face `` tween '' slight and stringy ,
but undeniably reese.i have always liked her as an actor ,
and had no idea
she started this young with her career 
go figure .
i actually gained some respect for reese to know
who she was so early on .
i say
that
because whenever i have watched her perform ,
the character thus far 
in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona
that lived with that character 
quite nicely in fact.anyway 
my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland ,
somehow i assumed
that was her first time up `` at bat '' not so ,
well done reese
