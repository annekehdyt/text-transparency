well 
the artyfartyrati of canne may have liked this film but not me i am afraid .
if you like the type of film
where shot linger for so long
that you wonder
whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then
it may be for you .
a large part of it is like this with short sojourn into the realm of unpleasantness .
i did not find it shocking nor
disturbing as some other reviewer have - simply a little distasteful and pointless .
the only reason
i did not give this one star
is
that the acting is commendable an the film
is fairly well shot .
the plot 
however 
has little to recommend .
a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching
or listening to piano ,
which might appeal to some person .
but lest you think
this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatch of pornography and sexual violence
just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth .
not recommended .
