shawshank 
godfather 
pulp fiction ... all good film .
great film .
but nothing ,
and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all ,
santa claus.the film is so great
and has so many message 
i cried
while watching it .
seriously 
this is one of those movie
you need to watch 10 time .
when we see pitch get told
he will have to eat ice cream ,
we see the sadness in his eye ,
and we feel the deep sorrow ,
and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream ?
is it implying
that we as human are treating ice cream as good
when all it does is make us evil ?
think
movie makes you think.this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever .
unlike other santa 
he is a normal person .
we see him imprisoning child and spying on kid dream ,
and we wonder ;
is the santa we believe in really that good ?
also 
this santa actually mention christ ,
the whole meaning behind christmas.you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece .
we should just stop making movie and air nothing but this epic 24/7 .
whether it is christmas or not ,
this movie gets a 500/10 .
whoever says
this movie is bad is an ignorant fool .
