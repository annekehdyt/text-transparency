i think
this would have been a much better film
if the cajun had been portrayed in a more believable light .
my family is from the southeast region of louisiana and i live in southeast texas
( about 20 mile from lake charle ) .
i have never heard
the person i grew up around talk like these folk did .
the cajun were portrayed as backward redneck .
most of the cajun i know are well educated 
proud person
and do not sound uneducated at all
when they talk the way
these person did .
all in all it was an ok movie 
with great scenery and music .
i understand
that the writer were from lake charle ,
and have knowledge of the area 
but for the love of all thing cajun 
please have the actor study the language ,
live amongst the person
you are portraying
and get an all around understanding
of how they are
before you go trying to act like them .
in my opinion ,
when the actor make you believe
they are that person ,
it is a much more enjoyable movie !
