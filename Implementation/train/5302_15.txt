superman and the mole man is quite possibly superman 's toughest adventure ever.lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby 
home of the world 's deepest oil well .
while there ,
some radioactive mole man come up through the oil well and explore the town .
jeff corey and many other townsperson try to dispose of the invading mole man .
can superman change the person 's way in time
to save the mole man ?
can superman warn the person in time about the radioactive danger
the mole man ing ?
in my opinion 
superman and the mole man is a very intelligent 
well-written and well-acted movie .
even though we only get to see superman fly once iefly ,
it still makes a great superman adventure .
a must see for anyone.10/10 star
