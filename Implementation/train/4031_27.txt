we gave up at the point
where george clooney 's character has his finger-nails extracted .
we were not squeamish -
having sat through an hour of this drivel
we just knew
what it felt like .
to say
this film was incomprehensible 
boring 
pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it !
how did person manage to sit through this confusing 
slow 
depressing pseud 's corner of a film ,
let alone nominate it for an oscar ?
clooney looked as ill
as we felt watching him .
what was he thinking ?
oh .. and what was with those subtitle ?
- did we just have a dud dvd
or was the original film
done like
that - sentence left hanging in mid-air ?
the film was hard enough
to follow
without that as well .
i pity the cast ,
who obviously did their best with the material available .
