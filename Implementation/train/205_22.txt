i really wanted to like this movie ,
but it was just imposable .
the acting was ultra hammy 
the plot was annoying ,
and the pace was slow 
sooo slowwwwww .
the whole time
sitting in the theater i
wanted the movie to end .
twenty minuet into a film and i am praying for an ending .
sure some of the visual were nice ,
but c'mon guy 
i mean really !
and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instrument
there really was not much music to speak of .
the music there was was annoying 
and boring .
there were sound loud shrill sounds at time too ,
those were also annoying .
mainly this film managed to bore me ,
and creep me out at the same time.i am glad its over .
i need to go see `` tideland '' and wash this bad taste out of my mouth .
