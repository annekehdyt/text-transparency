while i watched this movie ,
i tried to figure out why
they bothered making it .
though the main plot of the movie is potentially good ,
there are all sort of unrelated/unnecessary subplot .
the marketing person in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guy 
perpetual double-cross and the man and woman
who get too close
and have sex .
it is odd that we see more of them
having sex
than we did of the president and his mistress .
the many plot and subplot make the film too oad
and none of the character are properly developed - i really did not feel like i knew any character ,
except that everyone is corrupt and evil .
the ending is totally incomplete -
it left me more than just wanting what might have been ,
but what was supposed to be .
in the end 
there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do ,
except to serve as additional corrupt character
who commit a double-cross .
i am surprised
that so many established
( and good )
actor agreed to make such a hollow movie .
this seemed like a movie
made by college student
who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.do not waste your time
unless you are in a film class
and want an example of what not to do
when making a movie .
