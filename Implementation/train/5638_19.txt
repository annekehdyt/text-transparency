this movie is just another average action flick ,
but it could have been so much better .
when the gun come out they really needed some choreography help .
someone like andy mcnabb -
who made that illiant action sequence in heat
as they move up the street from the robbery -
would have turned the dull action sequence into something special .
because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better
than you would expect from this type of movie .
then came the final scene 
the show-down 
the one
we had been waiting for ,
but was like watching something from the a-team in the 80s .
they shoot wildly ,
nothing hit ,
and they run around a house
trying to kill each other - same old 
same old .
