one of the many vigilante epic
that flooded the market by the mid-80 .
the routine plot has echo of `` the magnificent seven ''
( believe it or not ) ,
the action scene are lamely handled
and the special effect are non-existent .
you could do worse
... .but the film is still just a waste of time .
( *1/2 )
