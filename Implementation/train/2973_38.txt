having not seen all the film
released in 2002 ,
i can not say
that this is the best film of the year .
i can say
that it is the best film i
have seen all year .
most american film featuring black person either obsess over the american preoccupation with `` race relation '' ,
or fall into the clich of the inner city ghetto 
with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased slang .
antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard :
race is irrelevant 
save for one fight
that may ,
or may not ,
have been provoked by a racial slur.antwone fisher 's story is one
that should find resonance with any empathic individual .
he is understatedly ,
and thoughtfully 
portrayed by derek luke .
denzel washington ,
while obviously using his star power
to have the film made ,
stick to the background for the most part ,
and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story .
at a time when bet 
and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of american
( and canadians too ,
you know ) ,
this is a film
that speaks to the humanity in all of us .
i just hope
that the non-black audience will go see this film for that humanity ,
rather than avoiding it
because they feel
that there are no character or actor in the movie
whom they can identify with .
that would be a sad commentary on race-relation in north america in and of itself .
