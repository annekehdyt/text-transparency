wow ... sheer illiance.turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.after watching this ,
i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 character
that were just insanely developed -
either not written in depth or too much depth.if
you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog 
messed up plot 
useless scene 
wasted character 
bad sound and lousy development overall ,
then this is the one to watch.be sure
to keep focused for the classic `` food processor '' scene and the totally inept police investigation scene.this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing
and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid 
daring or ave .
