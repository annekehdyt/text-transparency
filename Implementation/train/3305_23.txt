and i absolutely adore isabelle blais ! ! !
she was so cute in this movie ,
and far different from her role in `` quebec-montreal '' where she was more like a man-eater .
i think
she should have been nominated for a jutra .
i mean 
syvlie moreau was good ,
but isabelle was far superior 
imo .
pelletier has done fine work for his first time out ,
and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddy from rock et belle oreille 
guy a. lepage and andre ducharme .
it was fun to see them in this ,
i did not know
they were going to appear.i do not think
i have seen a romantic comedy from quebec
that i did not like ,
and this one is as good
as any i have had the pleasure to see .
and if you are in the state
and wondering
how you can get a copy of the dvd ,
www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week .
