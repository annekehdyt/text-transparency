this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission ,
so i really do not think
there is too much
not to understand to in case you are not czech.it is just a comedy .
the humor is simple 
pretty funny and sometimes 
maybe 
little morbid .
some actor and character are very similar to samot\u00e1ri
( 2000 )
( jir\u00ed mach\u00e1cek 
ivan trojan 
vladim\u00edr dlouh\u00fd )
so the author are .
but it does not matter ,
the genre is really different
and these two film should not be compared in this way .
jedna ruka netlesk\u00e1 will not try to give you a lesson ,
it will try to make you laugh
and there is some chance
it will succeed.not bad film 
not the ingenious one ,
but i enjoyed it .
some scene are truly worth seeing .
