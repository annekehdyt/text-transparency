from the start i knew
i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life .
the idea of two giant robot ,
manned by illiant human ,
fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced .
i can not even begin to describe the illiant acting and well written script .
let 's just just say it compares to both lord of ring picture 
combined .
the academy had a grave oversight in not celeating the joy
that is ... ..robot jox .
