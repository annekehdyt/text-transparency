i have always been a huge fan of `` homicide :
life on the street ''
so
when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up ,
i could not wait.let me just say ,
i was not disappointed at all .
it was one of the most powerful 2 hour of television i
have ever seen .
it was great to see everyone back again ,
but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back ,
because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show .
