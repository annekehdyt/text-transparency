i could not bear to sit through he entire movie .
do family like this really exist somewhere ?
there have been many comment
describing this family as akin to llbean model and such ,
and i think
that that is a great description
of how they behaved.more absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs
as we meet a character
referred to in high school as `` pigface ''
who 
of course 
has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year harvard-educated plastic surgeon
( but only to do good in the world-not for the money 
)
and she beds steve carrel on the first date .
that is when i quit watching ...
if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hour ,
then perhaps you will enjoy this sentimental 
self-indulgent waste of time .
