part of what was so great about the classic looney tune cartoon was their irreverence
and how they were not afraid to do anything
that they wanted .
in this case 
marvin the martian has an assignment to ing back an earthling .
sure enough ,
he comes across bug bunny ,
who warns of a mutiny on the part of marvin 's dog .
after marvin finally traps bug - by mean of an acme strait jacket-ejecting bazooka !
- bug has more stuff planned for the voyage back to mar .
what i mean is ,
if you thought
that it was a major change in the solar system
when they stripped pluto of its planet status ,
then you are not seen nothing yet !
yes 
`` the hasty hare '' goes all out .
how they buy acme product in outer space
is probably beyond most person ,
but the point here - i mean `` hare '' - is to have fun .
and believe me ,
you definitely will .
after all 
a little space-out never hurt anyone .
