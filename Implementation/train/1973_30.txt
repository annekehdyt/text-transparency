i really truly enjoyed this movie .
( which is why it surprised me
that it got such a low rating from so many user at this site ! )
i am not saying
that it is a cinematic masterpiece
but it was a great way
to spend a cold 
snowy saturday night .
it is funny 
poignant 
and a great tale of the up and down of female friendhip lasting through difficult time and the bad thing
that female friend tend to do to each other !
( fess up lady ,
we have all been there ! )
bill paterson shine as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves
that she can be a fine actress
when the role is right
and she puts her mind to it .
( and truly ,
there is the best `` wedding escape ''
that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more gut
than anyone i have ever known ! )
you will laugh
and you will cry
-- - ignore any marketing campaign
and how this film is being marketing ... .
it is a hidden gem
that should have done tonne of box office .
( now i have to look around
to purchase a copy ! )
