this is a decent little flick made in michigan ,
about a guy
that is haunted by his past 
with his abusive stepfather
( gunnar hansen )
and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted .
in fact 
he is absolutely bonker ,
but tries not to be too obvious .
he is got an entourage too 
his own little demon and angel
that follow him around .
the demon never says a word but really ,
does not have to ,
and he is max schreck-creepy .
let 's just say
that the angel pretty much spins his wheel in this 
as eric is busy doing thing
that make him feel better ,
like `` freeing '' person
that he decides need it ,
mostly beautiful young woman .
this is a decent portrayal of madness ,
and you are kind of on your own at some point
to figure out some of what is going on 
but overall 
i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film
because it definitely held my interest .
it is a little lacking in some area
but nothing i can really lay my finger on .
a decent effort and worth seeing
if you like serial killer flick .
