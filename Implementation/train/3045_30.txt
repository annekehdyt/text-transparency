i actually thought
this is a comedy
and sat
watching it expecting to laugh my ass off .
pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy 
or at least not a 'jim carrey type ' one .
what kept we watching was the character -
the movie starts with some pretty grim 
troubled person ,
gathered together to try
and fight one of their basic fear - fear of water 
fear of swimming .
we start to get bit by bit into their life ,
witness their trouble ,
guess of their thoughts.actually i made it look much darker
than it actually is 
and besides the chain of event soon ings some light and hope to their life.i probably would not have watched the movie had i known its not a comedy but rather a drama ,
but i had good time ,
enjoyed the story
and do not mind i spent about 90 minute with it.many film treat the alienation between person in the western world ,
this movie shows
how person can get together
and help each other ''
and if in the light of dying day
you meet her ,
do not let her pass you by and leave ,
do not loose her ,
she is your gift from the sun ... ''
