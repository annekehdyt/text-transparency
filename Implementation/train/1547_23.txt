when it comes down to fairy tale ,
cinderella was the one
that made you cry the most .
poor cinderella is a girl
who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsister and a slave-driving step-mother .
and thank to mr. walt disney ,
we got to witness cinderella in animation.before the story begins ,
cinderella and her father are lonely ,
and rich beyond their need .
to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sister 
cinderella 's dad marries a woman 
but then dies soon after .
the stepmother 
only seeing dollar sign in her eye and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter 
cinderella.so for many day 
cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sister .
she has hope however 
thank to her friend 
the mice of the home
( sounds like cinderella was not playing with a full deck . )
she has hope that one day she will find her prince .
the chance eventually comes
when the prince of the kingdom need a girlfriend.9/10
