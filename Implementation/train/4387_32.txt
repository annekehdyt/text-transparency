i remember this film ,
exhibit in barcelona
( spain )
in 1970 
for the time of a week .
although it could seems incredible ,
and i can not offer any explanation for it ,
this movie was exhibit in a theater
dedicated to ... movie of art and big quality
( that 
is 
bergman 
resnais 
malle 
bu\u00f1uel ,
and ... the projected man ) .
few person saw it
( luckly person 
no doubt )
and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie 
or about the author of the original novel .
very indicative .
i remember of it ,
after all this year 
a no-story 
a lot of special effect
that seems ridiculous effect in fact 
and no more .
it seems that in some country the running time is 90 mm .
and in another 77 min .
well 
it means only a little more of pain .
