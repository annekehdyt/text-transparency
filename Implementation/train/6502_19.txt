five minute into this movie you realize
that you have seen it all before .
it is boiler room .
it is the firm .
and it is the devils advocate .
and there are no new element here .
except for the all-to-clear bill gates-allegory .
conpsiracy are always good stuff for movie-making ,
but why does it have to be so extreme ?
boiler room is a good movie ,
because it - for a while at least -
seems realistic .
in antitrust everything is wrong .
how realistic is it for example
that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend
in order to make you work harder and control you ?
i would give it 1 ,
but the soundtrack is ok 
so 2/10 .
