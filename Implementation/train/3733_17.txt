this movie shows us nothing original .
every idea
or ( action )
scene can be found in many previously released movie .
fabulous nick is completely plain here .
even will patton is calm and evil nor good .
mr. duvall is ok ,
but has a very small part .
so does angelina ,
so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom ?
overall 
there are too many character ,
so that nobody
and nothing is especially detailed .
this makes the movie easy to forget .
too bad 
do not you think ?
