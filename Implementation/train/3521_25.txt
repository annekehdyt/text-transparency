i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival .
most of the audience ,
including my wife ,
enjoyed this comedy-drama ,
but i did not .
it stars lucas haas
( brick 
alpha dog ) ,
molly parker
( kissed 
the five sense 
hollywoodland )
and adam scott
( first snow ,
art school confidential ) .
the director is matt bissonnette ,
who 's married to molly parker .
all three actor do a fine job in this movie about 3 friend 
the marriage of two of them and infidelity
involving the third .
it all takes place at a lake house
and it looks wonderful .
the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama ,
and i thought
it needed to be the other way around .
