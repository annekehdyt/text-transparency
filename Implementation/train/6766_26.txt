this is not the comedic robin william ,
nor is it the quirky/insane robin william of recent thriller fame .
this is a hyid of the classic drama
without over-dramatization ,
mixed with robin 's new love of the thriller .
but this is not a thriller 
per se .
this is more a mystery/suspense vehicle
through which william attempt to locate a sick boy and his keeper.also starring sandra oh and rory culkin ,
this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report ,
until william 's character gets close to achieving his goal.i must say
that i was highly entertained 
though this movie fails to teach 
guide 
inspect 
or amuse .
it felt
more like i was watching a guy
( william ) ,
as he was actually performing the action 
from a third person perspective .
in other word ,
it felt real ,
and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.all in all ,
it is worth a watch ,
though it is definitely not friday/saturday night fare.it rate a 7.7/10 from ... the fiend : .
