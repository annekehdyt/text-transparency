the ogre is a film
made for tv in italy
and was not intended to be a sequel to demon as lamberto bava even mention it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd ,
but it was called demon iii to be part of the demon series .
the music in demon and demon 2 was 80 's rock music
while this is more creepy music
and while the first two was gory horror demon iii :
the ogre is a architectural horror
so that is how demon iii is not a proper sequel to demon
but i still like this film.the music is creepy
and that adds a tone to the castle
that the film is set in ,
the ogre is another thing
why i like the film .
there are two other film
that are classed as demon iii
and that is black demon
( demoni 3 )
and the church
( demon 3 ) .
demon iii :
the ogre is a good film
as long as you do not compare it with demon and demon 2 .
