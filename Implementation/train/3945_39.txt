wow 
i knew
this film was going to be bad but not this bad .
spoilerific comment ensue.roddy roddy piper is sickly sweet retired cop
( cliche !
) ,
helping out everyone
- smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son .
his adopted son return from armed force `` special op ''
and because he is `` seen thing '' -
portrayed by clenching his tooth
if anyone mention anything about the past .
time
to clean up the street from another guy
who once knew piper and his dead son
( who the bad lad killed )
and his adopted son.oh 
the love interest is a pretty young lady
who decides for no reason
that she wants to jump the bone of the ex-army bloke .
this happens in about 2 minute of 1 scene.the action could have saved this film ,
but it is even worse than the storyline and acting .
it is all been done before ,
it is all been done much much better
( ong-bak is a prime example ) .
this is the worst film i
have ever seen - and i have seen waterworld 
twice.erm ,
the film is called honor
( spelt wrong for the american )
and the tag line has `` from the maker of bloodsport and kickboxer '' - check out director david worths other film
and you will soon realise why they put these 2 film on there ,
even though they are over 10 year old .
such classic as `` shark attack 3 :
megalodon ''
- says
it all really.i will give you \u00a310
if you do not go to see this film.ps - apologise for not know character name ,
tell you something though .
