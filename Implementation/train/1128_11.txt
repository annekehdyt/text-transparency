a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it ,
but after ten minute of jame hetfield 's slow pitched vocal and lar banging on his drum set
in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think ,
`why am i watching this ? '
that question will be coursing through your mind in 5 \u0096 10 minute
after you hit play .
i gave the tape back the same day ,
as you would suspect ,
not worth
buying or watching !
just my opinion !
