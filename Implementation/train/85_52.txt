suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s tv hit `` love 
american style 
''
decked out with flash of nudity 
`` superchick ''
( 1973 )
is a lighthearted piece of fluff
that somehow still manages to entertain .
and the lead character here 
tara b. true 
really is some kind of superchick .
a stewardess
( not flight attendant )
who 's so good-looking
that even her plane 's autopilot has made a pass at her ( !
) ,
and with a hunky boyfriend in every port 
this wingin ' 
swingin ' gal really does put the `` lay '' in `` layover . ''
what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york 
her playboy with gangster problem in miami 
and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l.a. ,
tara sure does keep busy .
and when she is not draining these guy of all their manly energy ,
as the viewer learns 
she is liable to be taking a karate class 
mile-high clubbing 
fending off flasher and rapist ,
attending groovy pot party and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane .
as i said 
lighthearted fun ,
and surely good for a night
when you are feeling somewhat ain-dead
and just want to veg out in front of the tube .
future astrologist joyce jillson does ing some vacuous charm to her role as tara ,
and the film looks handsome enough to please .
disappointingly 
buxom '70s fave uschi digard and mary gavin
( aka candy sample )
are wasted here in very small role ,
but still get to do what they do best
-- show off their chesticle !
though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny
and does not really have many thought in its metaphorical head ,
it does succeed
in being consistently amusing ,
and i suppose that is something .
strange
that the end credit should call attention to ms. jillson 's body double 
however ;
do not think
i have ever seen that before !
