ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killer
that columbo has ever had to deal with .
and 
the plot is ingenious all the way around .
this is one of the best columbo episodes ever .
mariette hartley and g. d. spradlin are excellent in their supporting role .
and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scene with gordon .
