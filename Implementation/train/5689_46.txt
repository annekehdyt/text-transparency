what i expected :
a rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sport-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal
who likes him yet suffer
while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sport team.what i got :
an even-handed story
where both guy and gal end up admitting
-- to themselves and each other --
that
they each have passion in their life yet each can forgive the other
to save the love
they share.sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performance this story works !
barrymore is classic barrymore :
that perfect blend of sweet 
strong 
and adorable .
we expect
that from her and she delivered.but fallon is the nice surprise in this film .
he ings to the role the perfect blend of sport nut
combined with the appreciation for the normal thing in life 
like caring about kid and his girlfriend .
fallon deliver his line with subtle perfection .
he can be caring
( `` you just ran across the field for me ! '' )
and in the same eath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox
( `` how did the grass feel ?
kinda spongy ? '' )
at the same time .
fallon 's portrayal `` made '' the movie .
hopefully 
this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon ,
something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of snl alum
( i.e .
will ferrell )
.in short 
a movie
that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female character rose above
that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous line 
most
delivered with illiant subtlety by fallon.hey ,
i saw this with my wife
-- not a baseball fan --
and she loved it as much
as i did .
it is neither a `` guy flick '' nor a `` chick flick '' .
it is a terrific make-you-laugh flick .
go see it !
