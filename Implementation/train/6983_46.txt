quentin crisp once stated
that
when thing are shown too beautifully ,
one is a romantic .
when thing are show unbearably grim ,
they are realistic .
and when something gets the ironic treatmant ,
they are spot on .
unfortunately for leon de aranoa 
he falls into the second catagory .
this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish `` ken loach '' type movie ,
without being able to capture the comedy ,
and warmth between the character ,
that elevate loach movie from merely being 'depressing ' .
los lune al sol 
is just that 
only depressing .
thing are unrealistically grim .
the character ultimate momant of misery all reach a climax at the same point ,
and
if the glum story is not enough ,
aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette .
the films was ridiculously over-rated at the goyas .
a movie
that shows empathy for the weaker citizen in society ,
in this case unemployed harbour worker ,
does not automatically make for a good movie ,
even though i would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these person .
this movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate .
in 21st century spain 
unemployed person do not live like beggar ,
and the public transport ferry have decent restroom ,
and it is hard to come across a bar with so few punter and such little happiness to be encountered in it .
leon de aranoa obviously does not have a clue about working class spain ,
and does it no favours .
pretentious is the only conclusion
i can draw .
the scene
where the man watch a football match for free ,
has been directly copied from a film
which deals much more 'realistically ' with the subject of the 'poverty ' trap ,
namely `` purely belter 
''
which is afar more engaging 
humorous 
and yet sad .
