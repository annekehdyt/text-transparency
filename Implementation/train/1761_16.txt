i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating
that this movie was `` boring ''
and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage .
it was made in 1925 ! ! ! !
i think
it absolutely incredible for it is time !
the journey
that these person had to go through
is utterly remarkable .
it took them a week just to cross a river .
the woman carried their child in heavy wooden cradle on their back
climbing up a solid sheet of rock 
sometimes barefoot in the snow .
i would like to see anybody do that now !
i thought
it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shot and an incredible story .
