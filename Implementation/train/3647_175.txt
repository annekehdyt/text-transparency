obsession comes in many flavor ,
and exists for a variety of reason ;
for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder ,
but for other it may be an avenue of survival .
lack of nurturing ,
combined with an inability
to negotiate even the simplest necessity of daily life or the basic social requirement ,
may compel even a genius to enthusiastically emace
that which provides a personal comfort zone .
and in extreme case 
the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession ,
driving
that individual on until what began as a means of survival
becomes the very impetus of his undoing ,
and
as we discover in `the luzhin defence 
'
directed by marleen gorris 
a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem ,
and in fact 
may actually exacerbate the situation .
obsession ,
it seems ,
has no prejudice or preference ;
moreover 
it gives no quarter .
at an italian resort in the 1920 's 
alexander luzhin
( john turturro )
is one of many
who have gathered there for a chess tournament ,
the winner of which will be the world champion .
luzhin is a master of the game ,
but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him ;
rather 
it is his obsession ,
that one thing discovered in childhood
that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all area of life ,
and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisement of his immediate family .
so luzhin is a genius with an achille heel 
a flaw
which perhaps only one other person
knows about and understand ,
and furthermore realize can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament .
that man is valentinov
( stuart wilson ) ,
luzhin 's former mentor ,
who after an absence of some year has suddenly reappeared
and made himself known to luzhin .
valentinov is an unwelcomed 
disconcerting presence to luzhin ,
and once again life threaten to overwhelm him .
not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament 
turati
( fabio sartor ) ,
against whom in a previous match
he emerged with a draw after fourteen hour ,
but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life
-- his feeling for a young woman he is just met at the resort 
natalium
( emily watson ) .
and 
genius
though he may be ,
dark cloud are gathering above him
that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession
that has been the saving grace 
as well the curse 
of his entire life .
to tell luzhin 's story ,
gorris effectively uses flashback to gradually reveal the element of his childhood
that very quickly led to his obsession with chess .
and as his background is established ,
it affords the insight
that allow the audience to more fully understand
who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life .
for the scene of his childhood 
gorris texture them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding
that carries on into ,
and underly 
the present 
more pastoral setting of the resort .
the transition
through which she weaves the past together with the present
are nicely handled ,
and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting 
yet unrushed presentation
that works extremely well .
she also underplays the menace
produced by the presence of valentinov ,
concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense ,
which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film ,
making luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling .
the single element
that makes this film
so memorable 
however ,
is the affecting performance of john turturro .
for this film to work 
luzhin must be absolutely believable ;
one false or feigned moment would be disastrous ,
as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately .
it does not happen 
however ,
and the film does work ,
because the luzhin turturro create is impeccably honest and true-to-life .
he captures luzhin 's genius 
as well as his inadequacy ,
and presents his character in term
that are exceptionally telling and very real .
it is a performance equal to 
if not surpassing 
geoffrey rush 's portrayal of david helfgott in `shine . '
and
when you compare his work here with other character
he is created 
from sid lidz in `unstrung hero ' to pete in `o brother
where art thou ? '
to al fountain in `box of moonlight 
'
you realize
what an incredible range turturro has as an actor ,
and what a remarkable artist he truly is .
as natalium 
emily watson is excellent 
as well ,
turning in a fairly reserved performance
through which she develops
and presents her character quite nicely .
though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin ,
watson manage to do it in an introspective way
that is entirely effective .
most importantly ,
because of the detail
she ings to her performance ,
it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story .
you have but to look into watson 's eye
to know
that the feeling
she is conveying
are real .
it is a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor .
the supporting cast includes geraldine jame
( vera ) ,
christopher thompson
( stassard ) ,
peter blythe
( ilya ) ,
orla brady
( anna ) ,
mark tandy
( luzhin 's father ) ,
kelly hunter
( luzhin 's mother ) ,
alexander hunting
( young luzhin )
and luigi petrucci
( santucci ) .
well crafted and delivered 
`the luzhin defence ' is an emotionally involving film ,
presented with a restrained compassion
that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man .
we do not need a movie 
of course ,
to tell us
that there is cruelty in the world ;
but we are well served by the medium of the cinema
when it reminds us of something
we should never forget 
inasmuch
as we all have the ability
to effect positive change ,
and to make a difference in the life of those
around us .
i rate this one 9/10 .
