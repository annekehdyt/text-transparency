since its release in 1983 
`` a christmas story '' 
the jean shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego 
ralphie 
has become a true classic .
`` my summer story '' 
however 
still has shepherd as the narrator ,
but it has absolutely none of the charm ,
and the character are nowhere near the caliber of the original film .
`` my summer story '' is basically a mishmash of mediocre
and just plain not very interesting story ,
which include hillbilly neighbor and battling top .
charle grodin ,
who i normally like ,
is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father
( more aptly
handled by darren mcgavin in the original ) ,
and his character never seems anything but forced .
kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie ,
and the little other is all
but forgotten here .
only mom seems to have any worth here
and perhaps that is because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat
when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewife on `` free dish night '' .the story in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin .
may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to `` a christmas story '' ,
it is a very poor one and not worth most person 's time .
2/10 .
