end of the world is an uneventful movie ,
which is odd
since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth .
the main character is some kind of scientist ,
i am not exactly sure what kind .
he has two job at a governmant
( ? )
facility guarded by four security man .
his first job is monitoring transmission to and from space
( although this actually seems more like a hobby
he does
when not working on job # 2 ) .
job # 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ...
at least that is the best i can figure .
apparently the `` plant '' is not exactly top-secret 
as the scientist ings his wife there .
she hangs out
( they are on their way to a dinner )
while he discovers a message from space :
major earth disruption 
repeated over and over .
he says
something
about it being the first message from space
he is ever been able to decipher ;
his wife tells him
they are going to be late for the dinner party .
so they leave and go to the party
( ! ? ! ) .
momants later he finds out
that china has suffered a major earthquake .
from there 
the movie goes ... nowhere !
yes 
christopher lee is in it ,
but that really does not help much .
besides 
lee gives a lackluster performance along the line of his appearance in howling ii .
this movie is boring ,
but it has enough stupid elemants
that you might want to suffer through it once
if you like christopher lee or z-grade sci-fi .
plus 
there is lot of stock footage of the earth
being destroyed .
