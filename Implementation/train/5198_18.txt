this movie describes the life of somebody
who grew up in the worst of circumstance
but unlike many person he actually grew up to be a respectable person .
what more is that this is a true story.antwone fisher is so innocent
and yet he was abused such just
because he was not white .
antwone fisher has been married to the same woman for ten year
and he never fooled around with woman 
coke 
cigar 
weed 
alcohol 
or any of those thing
that are very popular in the place
he was growing up .
there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent .
the only rating i can give
it is a 10/10 .
