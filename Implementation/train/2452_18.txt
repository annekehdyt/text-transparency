i drove from sacramento to san francisco
( and back )
to see this movie premiere
-- and really glad i did .
as a big movie fan and a life-long northern californian 
i was surprised
how many oscar-winning film have been made in the bay area .
as a fashion designer
who really wants to stay in the bay area
as opposed to going to la 
george lucas ' comment about persistence 
community
and having a vision
really resonated with me .
hey ,
if he and all the other filmmaker can make it in sf ,
so can other artist .
would recommend this film
