well 
i get used after awhile to read comment about these movie
that do not reflect my experience at all .
to me 
amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movie .
he was a die-hard villain 
a no-apologies villain .
to me it was a eath of fresh air
to see him in a role
where his villainy is not sort of undercut in some way.the kid
who played aryan
was probably over his head with this cast .
there i think
maybe the director could have done better .
but ,
to be honest ,
the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel .
she is an unsung heroine 
a true veteran thespian
who is overqualified for every role
she is offered .
but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly
as she played virendra sahi 's wife .
she may be given little to do ,
but she does everything with total conviction .
i am sure
she sailed right over the head of most of the audience.so
if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average ,
you will not get much out of this movie .
but
if you constantly search for something more ,
then this might give you some of what you have been missing .
