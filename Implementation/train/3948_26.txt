anybody
who has ever been a fan of the original series ,
or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series .
the borg does not come around
until q ings the enterprise to the gamma sector ,
the klingon are never seen
until kirk encounter them 
the ncc-1701 was the first ship
to carry the enterprise name ...
.need i go on ?
berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry 's creation .
after he died ,
they only saw $ $ $ $
and just went their own way .
no wonder
majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series .
i do not blame her for not being involved with this mess .
poor bakula .
he is a great actor ,
as are the entire cast .
i like them all ,
but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedent set by the original series .
just check the rating .
i think
more person watched deep space 9
( which was untimely canceled ) .
