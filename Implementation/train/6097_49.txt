the spoiler in this review are offered as a public service ,
because the only way
to enjoy this costume melodrama
is to know that our protagonist 
the lady barbara skelton 
gets raped and gunned down in the end .
and not a momant too soon .
i would have shot the screen myself
but i was afraid
i would hit jame mason.the original 1943 novel ,
called `` the life and death of the wicked lady skelton ''
( i guess
person did not whine about spoiler back then ) ,
was written by a woman 
an english navy at who was either troubled or cynical or both .
her heroine is devastatingly beautiful ,
and the author seems to think
that
if you have beauty ,
nothing else matter .
but other thing do matter 
such as the fact
that lady barbara 's immediate and only response
when someone gets in her way
is homicide .
she murder three man in five attempt .
a serial femme fatale 
she is got a case of dissocial personality disorder
that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate .
lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp ,
wearing so much makeup
that i thought of her as a restoration-era joan river
( or a restoration-era joan river 
ha ! ) .
yet lady b. is irresistible to all three principal male character
-- michael rennie 
jame mason 
and griffith jone ,
all of whom do good work ,
as does patricia roc .
of course 
all three admirer realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is ,
but the plot keeps them all in her orbit
until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally ,
in what is meant to be either irony or just dessert .
given the dramatic death scene with a boom
lifting the camera out through the window and heavenward ,
i presume we are meant to give a damn about her death .
but her is the first corpse we do not care about .
