this is by far the worst horror/thriller i have seen in my 29 year .
if someone offers this
to you for free tell them no .
this movie makes you a dumber person
for knowing
you watched it .
the plot is not even the worst part of this movie ...
..its the acting 
camera work 
lighting 
and sound .
there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie .
whoever paid
to have this film
made
is oke now .
i hope
the director never gets the greenlight for another movie .
in its defense this movie was made quickly
to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer 's capture
but i have seen movie of the week
that looked like oscar winner
compared to this .
