lizzie borden 's love crime is an important film ,
dealing with the dark side of female sexuality
( and including full frontal female nudity ,
which sure beats the male kind ) .
it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky ,
but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of female gaining power through their insatiable lust.one
striking scene exposes the female fetish for horse ,
when the antagonist 
a counterfeit fashion photographer 
is seducing an older woman wearing eeches
by asking her to show
how she rides a horse .
he shoves a riding crop between her leg ,
pressing it against her crotch ,
and this greatly increases her excitement.then suddenly
he leaves her home
and she swears abjectly at the closed door.patrick bergin plays the con artist ,
and
though he falls a long distance from handsome ,
he picks on plain jane
and has enough screen presence to make one believe
the woman could swallow his line .
by all report 
sean young proves a weird person ,
and she is scarcely beautiful .
yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hip
and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination .
her performance is forceful
and complex.borden possess an intriguing worldview ,
and the fact
that it stands so at odd with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate .
