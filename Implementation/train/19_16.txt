i have never commented on imdb before ,
but i feel i have to after watching the batman animation .
its absolute rubbish !
warner brother had the perfect animation series in batman in the early 90s
so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula ?
i feel
like writing a complaint letter to wb .
the original animation was dark and ooding ,
exactly the way batman was intended to be .
wb had to mess this up with some tripe batman of the future .
now they produce this drivel .
the joker does not remotely resemble the joker from dc comic .
dc should sue .
i urge everyone
who agrees with me to email or write to wb and use person power
to get back the original formula
