the only connection this movie has to horror is
that it is horribly unentertaining .
i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail
than have to sit through it again .
even for a tv movie it is flat .
the cast is boring .
the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand .
how two director conspired to create such a nothing
movie will remain one of the great mystery of the 20th century .
there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the oman franchise ,
and it is shot in slo-mo
and cut short at the anticipated pay-off .
if you are tempted to see this ,
pop it in ,
set your alarm clock for 90 minute and get comfy .
with any luck you will doze off quickly ,
and the alarm will wake
you once the worst is over .
namely 
this movie .
