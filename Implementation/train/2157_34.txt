i was a bit scared
to watch this movie due to its rate .
but living in italy title like this never ever come across and i love step so much
that i decided to give it try .
and how surprised i was !
the story is different from any other dance-movie i
have seen lately 
with a deeper meaning than just `` winning '' .
it is touching and well written and well directed .
raya is such a strong character ,
i love the fact
that she never doubts herself ,
she is so mature
and focused and aware of her talent
( and what talent rutina wesley has ,
my jaw dropped in the final dance scene ) .
the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is 
honestly 
inspiring .
also 
the fact
that she is not the typical super-hot chick
( see jessica alba 
briana evigan 
jenna dewan 
zoe seldana ... )
makes her really appealing and real .
seriously 
why is this movie rated so low ?
you can understand between the first 5 minute
that it is a good work .
really good actually .
i even cried at the end of the movie .
and the dancing routine are just sick .
