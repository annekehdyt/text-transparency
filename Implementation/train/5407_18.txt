henry thomas was `` great '' .
his character held my attention .
i was so `` into '' the story
that
i forgot
it was not real .
i wanted him to keep the baby
and see what a special person he was .
the other person in the story were essential in the makeup of his character .
the way
they banded together
to help one another
was truly awe inspiring .
i love movie
that show the real side of human emotion
without having to hit you over the head ,
in that you are not smart enough
to figure thing out for yourself .
