this movie made me feel
as if i had missed some important scene from the very beginning .
there were continuity error and plot
that stopped as auptly
as they started .
i was very disappointed
because i love whoopi goldberg and danny glover ,
in addition to that have always trusted and respected danny glover taste in his choice of role 
`` grand canyon '' for example .
i just could not finish this movie ,
after what seemed an eternity ,
but was probably just a little over an hour ;
we had to turn it off .
there was no comedy ,
there was nothing about the character
to make you empathize or sympathize with them ,
there was no evoking of emotion at all
regarding this movie
and the clip of their past were poorly edited 
confusing 
and unnecessary .
what could have been a great idea for a movie 
even as a drama and not a comedy
( although i think
a comedy in this situation would have been better ,
because i love to watch white person freak out
and start acting like complete idiot ,
it makes me laugh )
became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store .
