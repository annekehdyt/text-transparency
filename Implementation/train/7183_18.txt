johnny and june carter cash financed this film
which is a traditional rendering of the gospel story .
the music is great ,
you get a real feel
of what the world of jesus looked like
( i have been there too ) ,
and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion .
cash 's narration is good too.but ... .1. the actor
who played jesus
was miscast .
2. there is no edge to the story
like cash put in some of his faith based music .
3.
because it is uncompelling ,
i doubt
we will see this ever widely distributed again.i
would love to buy the cd.tom paine texas
