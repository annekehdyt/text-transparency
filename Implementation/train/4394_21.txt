cutting to the chase :
this is one of the most amazing ,
most intense film i have seen in a long time .
the first movie in year
that left me absolutely staggered .
i could barely feel my way out of the theatre 
i was so overwhelmed.i have been staring at the screen for about fifteen minute trying to find some way
to describe the power of this film ,
and just failing .
highlighting any one aspect of it
-- the documentary-style video diary format 
the unflinching portrayal of the event 
the force of the character --
just seems to trivialise it all .
some may find it laughable
that any killer could be characterised as normal .
but then not all killer are raving lunatic foaming at the mouth .
many are quite regular 
unassuming person .
they are just wired differently.and
that is perhaps the most chilling thought of all .
