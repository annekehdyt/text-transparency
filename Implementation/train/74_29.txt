i was looking through the movie listing in my area on yahoo
and seen a movie
that had not been advertised .
i looked closer and noticed
that peter falk and paul reiser were in it .
having watched `` mad about you '' ,
once 
i was not a fan of paul reiser .
however 
i am a big fan of peter falk .
so the spouse and i took a chance .
we were both swept into this story .
the beautiful scenery 
the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral value
that are seldom seen in movie and the world today .
not that sappy emoted junk 
but real life situation from real life-like person .
i even have to say ,
paul reiser was excellent 
although 
i still will not watch `` mad about you '' .
i do not know
where this movie has gone .
i heard
it was put out in limited release .
it should be shared with the world .
it is one of the finest movie i
have seen .
