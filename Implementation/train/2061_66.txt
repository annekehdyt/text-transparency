i rented this
because i am a bit weary of '80s nbc programming
and apparently i saved myself a lot of money .
i have nothing against any of the actor and for their credit
they do a good job
but this show is flawed from the premise.we
have a character
who is unlikable .
he is full of flaw 
not enlightened 
and a complete jerk on a good day .
yet the reason
why anybody should care just is not there .
while creating an american sitcom
centered around a complete bullheaded jackass
is revolutionary and full of potential ,
it just is not met here within this show .
most of the supporting character are not fully fleshed character
but rather sad punching bag
that want empathy from the audience
for being punching bag .
as in any sitcom 
they are the one
who are made the most normal for the audience
to relate to ,
and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent
that we see bittinger being himself and harming person
and they just stay there
because ... .why ?
there is no reason .
any normal person would have simply left the abuse .
keeping them there
without any real reason
-- even the really unbelievable one
given by joanna cassidy in the very special 2-part abortion episode
that has major problem of its own --
is where the show just falls apart .
to simply believe
that person put up with this guy
because we are told
he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation .
if anything 
this is not even dramedy .
this is a badly plotted ,
conceived ,
and executed premise
that had a few moment
but overall met the fate it deserved .
someone had the gut
to go out
and make a very good idea ,
but the execution is so haphazard
that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the jerry springer show
where someone is abused by this tyrant
that we are supposed to root for because we are told to .
a show like this requires a deft touch
that the actor here could have provided easily ,
but somehow are not able to .
and that is a fatal error
that really killed
the program.chalk it up to a show in its infancy .
regardless 
the show is worth a watch .
but it really screwed up
when trying to aim for the star ,
and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been .
