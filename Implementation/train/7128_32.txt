one of the better vance film succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than michael curtiz .
this time around a generally hated financier is found
dead - shot in the head - in his locked
and bolted bedroom on the upper floor .
philo vance 
hearing of the situation
while about to set off for italy ,
decides to end his vacation and try to solve what
he thinks is a murder
and what everyone else is considering a suicide .
william powell is as affable a philo vance
as you will find .
he never seems to press
and is always very smooth in what
he says and does .
powell is aided by a host of very talented actor
- some first-rate character actor
and actress like mary astor as a niece
that hated her uncle 
ralph morgan as the dead man 's secretary 
paul cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier 
arthur hohl as a mysterious butler 
helen vinson
as the next door kept blonde ,
and two really good performance by jame lee as the chinese cook and portly eugene palette as a wise-cracking police detective .
add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by etienne girardot
as a public coroner always missing his meal .
it is this depth of suspect and a story
that has many plot twist
and turns
that make the kennel murder case a fast-moving 
fun mystery .
