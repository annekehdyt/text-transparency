i saw this movie a few month ago on cable ,
and it was fantastic .
william h macy is one of my favorite actor ,
and his performance was just amazing .
he makes you care for his character ,
even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing ,
and neve campbell gives a performance
that is with out a doubt
the best performance i
have seen by an actress this year .
she is fantastic as a wild young woman
who is wise beyond her years.donald sutherland is just plain creepy as macy 's father ,
and john ritter is fine as a shrink
stuck in the middle of everything
that is happening.i wish
that this was in the theater
because i feel
that it is a movie
that should be view by a wider audience .
that is a shame ,
because it is a hell of allot better
that most of the new movie coming into the theater now .
