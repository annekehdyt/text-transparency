considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy 's creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting .
however i probably had too high expectation
because i was quite disappointed by it .
first they turned the protagonist into a freak
who had the crazy idea
of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience 
in a public area .
so after that scene i began to worry
that it was just entertainment .
but the problem is that it got worse
as none of the other character
were properly introduced .
they focused too much on john doe
which made the story far less intriguing .
i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell 's performance
because i found
he did not make a believable john doe .
an other problem was the police story .
it really felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu
and it was not a pleasant sensation .
it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch 
the episodic format .
i could already see the filler coming one
after an other.so overall i was very disappointed by it
and do not recommend it to anyone .
considering how bad it was i better understand
now why the show got canceled .
in some way i have the impression
that it missed its target ,
developing character
to help the protagonist find his own identity .
it is sad
because there was potential ,
like the person he met at the club .
the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct .
but i will never know
if it got better 
probably not ,
because i do not plan to watch the next episode .
