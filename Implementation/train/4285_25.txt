every one should see this movie
because each one of us is oken in some way
and it may help us realize 1 )
my life is not as bad
as i thought
it was and 2 )
how important it is to adopt a child in need .
there are so many out there .
to think
that the movie was actually based on a real person
made us
think deep about life
and how the world has
and always will be .
corrupt ,
but that corruption does not have to reach your home .
we all have a choice !
definitely recommend this one ...
and
while you are at it ,
i would like to throw in `` the color purple '' and `` woman 
thou art loosed '' by t.d .
jakes.these are all movie
that are based on life
and give us a glimpse of life .
