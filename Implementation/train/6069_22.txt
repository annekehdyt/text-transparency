`` you are not going to shoot those little creature .
in the first place 
they have not done you any harm .
in the second place 
they may be radioactive . ''
ah 
the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that 
superman and the mole-man is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time .
it is beyond cheap
( the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frame of animation )
and pretty dull with it ,
though it has a surprisingly altruistic message \u0096 the mute mole-man 
diminutive actor with enlarged skull and fur coat
who look more like mr mxyzptlk
without the hat than subterranean critter ,
released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious ,
merely misunderstood 
and george reeve ' man of steel try to prevent the local small-town mob
led by jeff corey from killing them .
an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day 
perhaps 
but with little more than good intention to recommend it .
