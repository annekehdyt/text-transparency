i will not argue with anyone
who pronounces this film execrable ,
as is january jone 's performance 
but please check her out ,
if you have not already 
in the amc tv series 'mad man 
''
starting later this month .
she is excellent ,
as is the entire cast .
i will charitably assume
she took on the `` taboo '' role strictly for the money ,
and 
realizing what a putrid mess
it was going to be ,
turned in a minimal acting job
to avoid starvation .
do not know
if that is the case ,
but i
( now )
know for sure
that she can act.at first ,
watching `` taboo 
''
i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice
that would later give rise to some significan not revelation about her character or the plot .
no such luck .
hard to believe
the director did not suggest to her at least once
that not changing expression for 17 successive scene could cause lockjaw.ironically 
her winning performance in `` mad man '' comes as a character
who 
at least in her early appearance 
is very repressed 
reserved 
unsure of herself 
and rather colorless 
not unlike her `` taboo '' role .
but as the tv series progressed 
she began to blossom into someone
who question her traditional early-60 's whiteead mom role .
can not wait to see
where they take her character in the 2nd season.to sum up ,
avoid `` taboo '' like leprosy ,
but definitely check out `` mad man . ''
