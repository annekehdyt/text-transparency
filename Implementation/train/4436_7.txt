this version of anna christie is in german .
greta garbo again plays anna christie ,
but all of the other character have different actor from the english version .
both were filmed back to back
because garbo had such a following in germany .
garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version .
it is a good tale and a must-see for garbo fan .
