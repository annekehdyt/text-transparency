i am totally surprised by some of the comment on this forum 
and many of the review .
i think
tony scott made a good movie here .
yes 
it is highly stylized 
flashy and over the top ,
but it is very entertaining .
i am glad at least ebert and roeper agree with me : )
this movie may not be for anyone ,
but if you like over-the-top 
dark humor 
cool action and dialog ,
you should see it .
i have previously seen scott 's man on fire 
crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movie ,
but i like this one more .
it is like a roller-coaster ride 
with great soundtrack selection 
visual style and in a time
when all movie seem to be pg13 ,
it is nice to see
that someone is not afraid of showing nudity 
gory violence ,
and have explicit dialog.it does not hurt
that keira is super-hot ,
and even show nipple in this one 
either ...
