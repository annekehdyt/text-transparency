thank god this was not based on a true story ,
because what a story it is .
populated by despicable character
whose depravity knows no bound ,
before the devil is a mesmerizing ,
jaw-dropping excursion into perversion
which would be laughable
( and sometimes is 
even with - or perhaps
because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout )
if it were not carried out with such magnificent 
overwhelming conviction by its star .
the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet does not hurt either.the main dysfunction here is of a family nature 
with the two majorly screwed up other
( illiant portrayal from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke )
deciding to rob their own parent ' jewelry store 
an attempt
that goes pathetically awry.the story is told with time-shift
( which are noted on screen 
such as :
`` charlie :
two day before the robbery '' 
so no one should be confused ) ;
some person have said
they did not like this device
but i thought
it worked perfectly ,
adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair ,
considering
that the two other in question are hardly playing with full deck -
between them you could not make a decent poker hand
to save your life .
throw in these cheesy extra tidbit :
one of the other is a drug addict ,
married to gina
( marisa tomei 
also excellent ) ,
who is having an affair with the other other 
toss in some monumental sibling rivalry 
along with the fact
that said
drug addict other hates his father
( a wrenching performance from albert finney ) ,
who has apparently caused him serious past pain ,
and you have got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hand .
proceed with caution .
