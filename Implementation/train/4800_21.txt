this is quite the gripping 
fascinating 
tragic story .
quite good 
and for the most part pretty accurate 
considering
it is a tv movie rather than a documentary .
they did create some fictional character ,
and combine several actual person into one character ,
but otherwise this is a good
telling of a very tragic and dark story.the final moment of the movie ,
depicting the mass suicide/murder ,
are almost directly taken from an audio recording
made by jim jone .
this recording was made during the final 44 minute of the persons temple 's existence .
it is available in several place on the internet .
this portion of the film is almost spot on in
that regard.to sum up 
a documentary this is not .
however 
it does cover most of the base elements to the person 's temple story .
