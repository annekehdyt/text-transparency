8 simple rule for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start .
the supremely-talented tom shadyac was involved in the project .
this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular ,
and that is exactly what happened :
the show remain one of the freshest 
funniest 
wittiest show
made in a very long time .
every line 
facial expression 
casting choice 
scene 
all wreaked of perfection .
there was not one episode
after which i thought ,
`` man that was not as good as the rest '' .
each one was a standout .
again 
this is the kind of perfectionism
that we have come to expect from tom .
for those
who do not know ,
tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura
( first movie ) ,
the nutty professor
( first one )
and liar liar .
quite a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 .
he is a producer here not a director ,
but his magic touch is felt in every episode.the family consists of :
the father :
paul hennessy
( john ritter ) :
nice 
slightly neurotic 
can be a pushover from time to time 
works as a sport writer .
john unfortunately passed away in 2003
leaving a fond memory and near-sure cancellation contemplation by the suits.the mother :
cate
( katey sagal ) :
come on ,
who did not fall in love with katey
when she played peg on married with child ?
al bundy was our hero .
we viewer gave him the respect and love
he never had .
but without peg 's nonchalant 
parasitic 
lazy lifestyle ,
al would 've probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg
( life 
actually )
caused him to be .
katey was a milf back then
and still is :
a une now
( instead of a redhead )
and just as buxom as ever .
cate is the conservative mom and loving wife .
i know it sounds boring ,
but comedically 
she fits perfectly .
the ditzy blonde daughter :
bridget
( played to perfection by kaley cuoco ) :
almost never has an idiot been played so well .
aside of gob on arrested development 
bridget may well be a shoe-in for any award
given to this archetype .
bridget is shallow 
self-centered 
not very ight and a tad slutty in his look .
she plays the dumb blonde role better
than absolutely anyone imo .
perfection .
one of the high-point of the show.the overlooked geeky daughter :
kerry
( amy davidson ) :
a une and a geek ,
she gets no love from life or circumstance .
feel overlooked 
under-appreciated and neglected most of the time .
she is bridget 's younger sister
( in reality she is older than her )
and the two 's extremely opposite personality and ain cause endless clash 
to much of our amusement.the son :
rory
( martin spanjer ) :
was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter 
then john pass 
new character come
and rory is not the wise-cracking verbal-trouble-maker
that he used to :
that went mostly to david spade 's character .
those character were the main one at the time of john ritter .
unfortunately enough 
the insanely hilarious larry miller
( one of my favorite )
did not get lot of screen time .
he played paul 's co-worker/competitor .
after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in 2003
( september 11th ) ,
the show was on hiatus for a while .
no one thought
it could come back ,
but it did later on 
with a couple of new addition .
this began the second phase of the show ,
and the new character were :
the strict 
confident school principal :
ed
( adam arkin ) :
i saw adam here
and there on talk show .
this was the first time
that i saw him do anything .
impressed 
is the word i use .
his performance was very impressive .
sad he was not ought in earlier .
he also plays cate 's potential love interest after paul pass .
the gradual progress toward this point
( which would 've sounded crazy at the beginning )
earns the creator lot of praise .
it was done slowly 
carefully and excellently 
with constant respect paid to the paul
( ritter )
.the attitude grandpa :
jim egan
( james garner ) :
a surprisingly welcome addition to the series 
he was cannon fodder for endless 'old ' joke ,
mainly by ... the 35-year-old unemployed wise-cracking half-other of the mom :
cj
( played to insanely funny height by david spade ) :
i knew spade was funny ,
i just did not know
he was this funny .
somehow 
spade 's very familiar presence is sensed inside his character
( as opposed to a separable character ) ,
which is understandable ,
since he is a comic
and he is on a comedy show .
this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lot of material from david spade 's appearance in movie 
talk show and function
( award show 
etc . )
and delivering a superb impersonation of spade 's voice and comedy style 
except ,
that it is spade .
by that i mean you realize
he is not trying to play someone else 
or a whole new character :
he is being the goofy ,
funny spade we have come to know ,
and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top .
every line he uttered 
every sarcasm he begot 
all classic 
literally .
spade was crazy-funny ;
so 
so funny.the show 's humor and drama were both upped
after the show was back ,
but audience thought 
`` john passed 
it are not gon na be the same anymore '' .
this is understandable ,
considering we are talking about a group of person
( american viewer )
who gave 'yes dear ' a free ride
but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time .
as the show 's quality increased ,
its rating declined .
soon it was no more 
sadly .
and i saved the best for last :
fan of married with child are in for a treat .
and boy 
what a treat it was .
i still shiver just remembering it .
it is a surprise so good
that it would be crazy for me to spoil it ,
even if i legitimately do it under the `` spoiler ... '' pretext .
suffice it to say
that it is something you will never forget .
i know i will not : - )
