the remake of h.b .
halicki 's classic seventy chase film is simply horrible .
along with vanishing point 
gone in 60 second represent the quintessential car chase film .
the remake takes the original
and stands it on its head .
wherea halicki gave us 75 % car chase and 25 % supporting drama ,
in giss 2000
we get 25 % car chase and 75 % supporting drama .
cage as super man 
saves his other 
kisses the girl .
mtv edit 
tit and ass .
save your money ,
rent the original .
at least halicki did not live to see his baby
( he wrote 
produced 
directed 
and starred in the '74 ' film )
degraded in this manner .
