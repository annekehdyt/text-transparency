i am easily entertained .
i enjoyed `` hot shot '' and `` the naked gun '' and their many sequel ,
even when most person found them unbearable .
i have even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movie .
there is only one movie
that i have seen
that i can honestly say
was bad ...
and this was it .
it is been a while
since i have seen it ,
but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking ,
`` this is a dumb movie .
why did i see this ? ''
it is honestly the only movie
that i can not recommend .
