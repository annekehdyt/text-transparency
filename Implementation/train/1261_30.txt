well 
i must say
that this was one hell of a fun movie .
despite the fact
that the dubbing was pretty cheesy ,
and there were some odd moment
where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason ,
i was not disappointed .
the story was actually pretty interesting :
the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five member and discover
who among them is using their skill for evil ,
and who is using them for good .
the catch
being that during training ,
all of the clan were masked ,
and all have since returned to society in disguise
and changed their names.the fight are a joy to watch ,
as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style :
toad
( my favorite ) 
snake 
scorpion 
lizard 
and centipede .
the fight scene have the actor jumping all over the place ,
and thankfully the camera stays planted
and uses a wide enough shot
so you can clearly see all of the action.the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence .
but stick with it ,
and you will not be disappointed !
