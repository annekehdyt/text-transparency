neat premise .
very unrealistic .
what i learned from this movie
is that speeding crazily out of control
to go to the weekend cabin
may not be the best idea after all .
i loved
how bill conveniently rolls out of the car
and down the hill with no injury at all !
unfortunately 
the same can not be said for his gal .
oh 
and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.lot of dragged out scene
including a plain stripper
( still have nightmare from that scene ) .
poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand .
i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious `` thing '' was behind the door ,
but
when it appeared ,
i just laughed .
ha ha ha ! !
the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived .
personally 
i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that !
