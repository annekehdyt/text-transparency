everyone in a while ,
disney makes one of tho movie
that surprises everyone .
one
that keeps you wondering until the very end .
in the tradition of pirate of the caribbean 
this movie is sure to turn into a ghost ,
and kill and rape your village .
it is terrible .
if you want a mindless 
senseless 
predictable `` action '' movie ,
go right ahead .
i believe
that young kid might enjoy this ,
as they like it
when good always win .
but me 
i like movie where it is a toss up
who 's going to win .
this movie never lets the bad guy have the upper hand .
by the end ,
when th hero are left in an `` inescapeable '' pit ,
you just know
that they can get out .
everything works out perfect for cage and his friend ,
he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 second ,
no matter how complex it is .
see this movie if you want to see some impressive set design ,
not if you want to see good acting 
or a good film .
go watch a superman movie ,
it would be much shorter ,
and the kid would like it more .
for instance 
the scene
where cage
is fleeing from armed gunman ,
and the bullet are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape .
( and i am not talking about a fence or anything ,
just one little pole )
this movie shows the decay of film and the film industry to cheap gag and dull 
unrealistic action ,
which this movie provides in huge quantity .
