i contend
that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie
has completely blundered .
no one i know wanted to see this movie
based on the preview ,
and everyone
who actually saw it
( that i know )
absolutely loved it ... the advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder.opened at # 4 behind ... # 1-rush hour 
which i have not seen 
average imdb score of 7.4. # 2-the bourn ultimatum 
which i have seen 
awesome movie but 3rd week out 
average imdb score of 8.7
( deserving i would say ) .
# 3-the simpson movie 
which i have seen 
okay movie but 4th week out 
average imdb score of 8.1
( a bit high in my opinion ) .
# 4-stardust 
average imdb score of 8.4
( lower then bourn ,
but that is been our for 3 week )
.whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think
that the power that be behind this movie screwed up big time !
this should have been advertised as an amazing movie
that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale
and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad :
( anyway-
now that i have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on ... awesome movie ,
go see it !
