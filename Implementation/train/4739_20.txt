do not see this movie .
bad acting and stupid gore effect .
a complete waste of time .
i was hoping to see a lot of cool murder and hot chick ,
instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you 
the watcher .
disgusting .
the murder are pretty lame 
basically strangulation .
one woman
he stuffs worm in her mouth ,
one he puts raw hamburger on her face and strangles her .
btk = btk oiler 
burger king 's `` killer '' new sandwich ... .ha ha .
i do not think
this movie relied too much on actual fact .
i mean 
he real btk killer did not carry around a bunch of rodent 
scorpion and worm..and oh yeah ... a slaughtered cow head too .
go figure .
