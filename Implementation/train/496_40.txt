hood of the living dead is about a young scientist
named rick
who lives with his other in the town of oklahoma
where drug dealer and prostitute fill the street .
then one night 
rick 's other gets shot by a gang driving down the street
who fought with him earlier .
desperate 
rick calls his scientist partner to ing over the latest formula
they have been working on that ings sick blood cell to health .
the formula has not been tested on a human 
or even a dead body
but rick is determined to ing his other back to life .
he gives the body a double dose of the formula
but nothing happen .
so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away
only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh .
now rick must find his zombie other
before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead .
hood of the living dead is one piece of trash .
the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil ,
the acting is just horrible especially with rick ' s fake crying for his other ,
the gun are so fake
because every time the weapon is fired
it sends sparks out ,
and the make up is just lame .
it is only fake blood covered over the actor face .
the zombie are also modified .
they run 
growl ,
and must be shot in the heart to die !
zombie should only scuffle 
moan ,
and must be shot in the ain to die !
this film is so horrible ,
the outtake is the only true good moment of this film .
hood of the living dead gets a 3/10 
a little entertainment here
and there
but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest .
