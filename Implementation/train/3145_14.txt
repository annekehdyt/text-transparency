although it is most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk ,
there is such a charm to dudley moore 's portrayal of lovable lush ,
arthur bach one can not help but feel for this unique and wonderful character .
how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness .
although i am not really a liza minnelli fan ,
she was really excellent
as linda marolla and i could not picture anyone else in that role .
sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar .
the rest of the cast also excellent
and that great tune `` arthur 's theme '' 
wow .
truly this was one of the best comedy of the 1980s .
great film get better with each viewing
and that is the case with `` arthur . ''
