what else can you say about this movie ,
except that it is plain awful.tina louise and adam west are the reason
why to see this ,
but 
that is it ,
but their talent are wasted in this junk.i think
that they used a double in some of adam 's scene ,
like when he is running
because you can not see his face.if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare ,
just think
what he must 've felt about appearing in this ? ? ?
if it was before or after ,
i am not sure ,
but 
still 
zombie nightmare is a classic
( check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last )
compared to this.the gang
is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors.a rip-off of the wild one starring marlon brando 
of course.tina look stunning though.i hope
her and adam got a good paycheck ! !
pass !
