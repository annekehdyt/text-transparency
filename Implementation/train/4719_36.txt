i have read over 100 of the nancy drew book ,
and
if you are not ight enough
to catch on yet ,
nancy drew the movie was of a younger nancy drew 
not the 18-year-old
that does not go to school
that all of the book are about .
this was when she was sixteen .
so naturally ,
she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering
she is only in the 10th grade .
other than that 
i thought
the movie was very cute .
it was clean and appropriate for everyone .
it was funny at time .
i thought
emma robert did a great job .
she was articulate 
in character 
and cute .
i liked the awkwardness
that nancy and ned had around each other
because they obviously were not old enough
to be in a serious relationship
like they have in the book .
it was a cute ,
pg movie
that i throughly enjoyed
because i ,
unlike most person my age ,
enjoy movie
without sex 
drug 
or profanity .
