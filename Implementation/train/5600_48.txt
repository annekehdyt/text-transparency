this could be looked at in many different way .
this movie sucks 
its good or its just plain weird .
the third one probably explains this movie best .
it has strange theme
and just has a strange plot .
so
who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad ,
average or even how good it might be.the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller .
jack black i have alway liked
so you know
what you will get out of him
but this is not bad .
christopher walken is alway off the wall .
he is alway enjoyable to watch no matter
how bad the movie is .
comedy wise it is somewhat funny .
this of course meaning
that it does have its moment
( though very few )
but can get a little over top here
and there
which makes me feel
like the movie is just desperate for laugh but of course not in a good way.the
directing was average as well .
barry levinson is a slightly overrated director
and really did not do a good job here .
this movie seemed
that it had a lot more potential
and he
did not do much to reach it .
just very average
and did not seem like a lot of effort
was put into making this film.the writing
is the key to a good comedy .
obviously that means the writing here failed .
at best it is below average .
considering
it does have its moment
it was not too horrible .
that is never a good thing
to say about a movie though .
if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating .
he is alway quite a character in his movie .
stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange character
that really do not go anywhere .
not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though
because it is a very forgettable movie .
