i agree with the above comment ,
i love the realism in this ,
and in many movie
( not just movie on eating disorder )
the producer seem to forget that .
they take an every day problem
and create a hugely dramatic scene
and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again ,
which i dislike
because its not reality .
not meaning to say
thing can not get better ,
and not meaning to say
thing do not in this movie ,
but it does not spend most of the movie
creating all these problem ,
and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again .
when person have eating disorder person
do not just admit it and want to get better ,
and then life is peachy ,
it takes time ,
and i like how in this movie we grow with the character ,
we go through the difficulty with them 
getting better and worse ,
because it is a very important part of the movie .
it gets into the mind of person with eating disorder ,
and shows the complication and pain 
in a very realistic way ,
and i loved that .
i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal person feel
when suffering from eating disorder ,
it is scary to see how person react
when they find out ,
especially if they approve of it .
i thought
this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told 
and defiantly one of my favourite .
