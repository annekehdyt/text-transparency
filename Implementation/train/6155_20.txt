person call this a comedy ,
but when i just watched it ,
i laughedonly once .
i guess
the problem is that i first saw it
when i was 14 ,
and i was not old enough
to understand
that it was not meant to betaken seriously .
there were quite a few scene
that were meantto be funny ,
but i cared too much about the character to laugh atthem.i suggest
that you watch this film next time you are falling in love ,
and try to take it seriously .
i think
you will find
that ,
despite a few sillyflaws ,
it is one of the most moving love story
you have ever seen .
