pathetic is the word .
bad acting 
pathetic script 
cheezy dialog and hip hop music and fashion ...
what the hell was up with that ?
the directer of this movie acts as bad
as the movie he made .
if someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing ,
it may of had a chance .
bet
the studio are still trying figure out
how they could screw up up so badly.the absolute best thing about this movie
was stacey dash ...
the asian chick was not too bad neither .
these too gal carried the whole movie .
if it were not for them i would have destroyed my copy of this movie.if any of those
who have not seen this yet
and had a notion to ,
do not waste your time ...
you will only regret it later .
