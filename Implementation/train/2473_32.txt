im going to keep this fairly ief as to not spoil anything for you .
this movie is awesome .
from beginning to end ,
it is filled with genuine thrill .
the fight scene are fantastic ,
the chase scene are enthralling ,
and it moves at such a pace
that it really only felt slow toward the end
when thing are explained ,
but that is only because everything that preceded it .
damon shine and really has proved a very solid actor ,
daring you not to believe him in this role .
he is this role .
a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain
( hope i spelled
that close to right )
as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne .
this is non stop
and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way .
some thing toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous ,
thus negating a 10 rating .
the ending is left open for sequel and i sure hope
that they consider doing more of these ,
for none have been bad .
excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.p.s .
the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action ,
but i still think
we could do without it .
the good news is 
you only really notice
it when person are talking
and not so much the action .
