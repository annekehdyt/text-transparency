spielberg 's first dramatic film is no let-down .
it is a beautifully made film
without any flaw about the life of an african-american woman .
it also proves that not all movie
that have the african-american ethnicity as the center of the story
have to be helmed by an african-american director.what i love about this movie
is spielberg 's ability
to make it very realistic
despite the fact
that it was based on a book .
furthermore 
danny glover was excellent as mr. and usually ,
he is just himself throughout most of his movie .
but in this 
he completely anches out
and is someone else for once .
but 
the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg .
she is excellent as celie .
you will never forget these character
once you have seen this movie.now ,
i heard
that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well ,
and all i can say is :
i hope
it is about as good as this one is ,
because this one is a film
that should not be missed .
