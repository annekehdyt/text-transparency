i hope the viewer
who regards 'dream machine ' as one of corey haim 's finest and the `` best movie of the century ''
was kidding .
undetected sarcasm on my part ?
i sincerely hope so .
'the dream machine ' mark the first of a long line of mediocre caper
that would plague the rest of corey haim 's career
( except 'prayer of the rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) .
here 
haim play nonchalant college boy 
bernie ,
who supposes
that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention .
lucky for bernie 
a rich woman
aiming to get back at her cheating husband ,
hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner
-- bernie --
with a gift :
a slick porsche turbo .
however 
unbeknownst to the woman 
and unfortunate for bernie 
is that
her dead husband was murdered
and his body was hidden in the trunk .
now ,
being that in this movie ,
body do not seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk ,
bernie is unaware of this .
in fact 
the oblivious boy has no idea
that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstance
that arise .
in particular 
a grizzly man follows him around ,
desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected.this is a low-grade action fizzle as many of haim 's film like this are
( see the double o kid ) .
despite being part action 
part romantic comedy ,
this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minute
in which the filmmaker take more than enough time
to show the immediate problem
( i.e .
bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body ,
and a hit-man finding out
that the porsche is going to be hard to find ) .
after which 
and thank to poor
acting by haim
( i loved this kid 
too ,
but it is not exactly sacrilegious to admit the time
when he obviously could not act well )
and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain
that makes much of the event unconvincing
and as a result 
inappreciable .
to add injury to insult ,
the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident song you would hear in team america
( see the 'date ' montage )
.loyal corey haim fan 
however 
should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance .
however 
other understanding
that haim 's career probably peaked
when he was 14 or 15
and never recovered ,
might expect mediocrity ,
as will viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff
to pass the time .
