as we all know
hollywood enjoys changing historical event around for our enjoyment ,
and 44 minute is one of those hollywoodized movie .
for example the bank robber never did go back in the bank
when they started shooting at the lapd yet in the movie
we see them go back inside twice !
another example is the number of lapd officer
who were shot near the end of the movie ,
this is far from the truth !
but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending
so they *add* some more blood and gut .
some event were combined
and many of the lead actor played several different person
but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain ?
i guess
the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentary about the north hollywood shootout on tlc
that were far better then this !
