the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent
so i decided to check it out .
bad idea !
this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends .
the story is stupid 
mix two part ringu with one part prom night 
a sprinkle of i know
what you did last summer ,
and add a tiny dash of single white female -
now blend until completely nonsensical .
there is nothing new to this plot ,
and revisiting the clich\u00e9s i have grown so fond of was not even entertaining this time .
this movie jumps to and from the past too much ,
and once i made sense of it all i realized
it still did not make much sense .
character go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye .
speaking of character ,
they are all your stereotypical favorite - the greedy selfish lawyer 
the egocentric actress 
the has-been baseball star 
the video voyeur 
the bitter girl 
the spooky quiet chick 
the 'nicer-than-nice ' nice girl 
a freakin ' black cat ... and i did not care about any of them .
perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work ,
there were some decent scene in it ,
but overall this movie was a mess .
i should also mention a certain 'video tape '
that would have been impossible to shoot .
this movie is not the worst asian horror has to offer by far ,
but it is still pretty bad .
if you just want to see some creepy image in the dark ,
or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting ,
or just want to yell `` you are stupid ! ''
at a movie screen 
or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve
when someone asks you
how many you have seen
- this movie is for you .
those
seeking a decent plot look elsewhere .
