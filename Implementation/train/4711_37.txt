kim basinger star as della 
a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband ,
who gets into trouble
while she is out at the local mall
doing some last minute christmas shopping .
after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper
and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car
that took up two parking space ,
she finds out
the owner of the car are the rainbow coilition of villain comprising of a white guy 
a mexican 
a chinese guy and a black .
they confront her about the note 
cap a helpless security guard ,
and the chase is on .
during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter
as she unleashes her inner bronson.i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller .
the acting was good enough
( except for a few scene ,
the `` why god why '' bit was cringe worthy in it is badness though )
it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact
that the villain della chase from/after are mind-numbingly stupid .
if they had not had the intellect of any given `` home alone '' baddie ,
perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes .
the unbelievability factor i
am willing to overlook as both the director
and one of the producer had part in inging `` shoot em up '' to the screen
( a film
which
while throwing credibility out the window
was immensely fun ) .
this film
while never attaining the height of that film ,
was good in it is own rights.my grade :
c- anchor bay dvd extra :
commentary with writer/director susan montford and producer don murphy ; a 25 and a half minute 'making-of ' ; a trailer and two tv spot for this film ;
and trailer for lower learning
