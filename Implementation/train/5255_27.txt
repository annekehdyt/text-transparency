not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography
( screenplay 
acting 
setting 
etc . )
but also for it is realism .
this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting .
it makes no difference
if the movie takes place in louisiana
or if it would take place in kansas .
the story and the message
it includes
would remain the same .
this movie shows family value
and connection for an older audience ,
while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewer .
everyone
who watches this will walk away with something
having touched them personally ,
i know i did .
the ending hit way too close to home for me not to burst into tear every time i watch it .
the ending stresses the importance of farm safety ,
and everyone
who has ever worked on a farm needs
to see this film .
not paying attention
and carelessness gets you into dangerous situation .
