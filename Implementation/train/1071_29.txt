cb4 was awful ,
but it may have given cundieff the idea
to it better .
more like spinal tap than anything else ,
the film is clever from the start .
surprising anyone
who saw it back in the mid ninety .
the performance are played for laugh but not so much so
that they are cartoon character 
more like marx other .
these guy are real and slightly diverse .
they react to situation like any of us might .
well 
we may not throw a tantrum
when our performance hat are late to the gig 
or pull gun and beat down a record company exec ,
but you get the picture .
n
( n***as )
w
( with ) h
( hat )
takes itself seriously enough to reel you in ,
then you are hooked .
rent or get this at all cost ,
even if you are not really into rap music ,
this will still leave you gassing out loud .
comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas ' star war to gil gerards'buck roger ' i think
you see my point
