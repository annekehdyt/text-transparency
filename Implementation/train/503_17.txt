four best friend young male chauvinist pig
( with the emphasis on pig )
meet weekly at a nyc diner
to recount their dating sexploit in this misanthropic and visceral comedy .
peet is the common denominator
who dates the three bachelor in the group
which leads to conflict and the inevitable `` whipping '' .
although the film 's premise has potential
and there are some funny moment
to be had ,
overall the flick does not work especially in the end
where the girl are made to appear no better than the guy
which runs contrary to the crux of the story .
one of those one-man band flix with a dozen producer ,
`` whipped '' is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young male
who think
`` the man show '' is emmy material .
