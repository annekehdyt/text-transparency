october sky is a highly lauded movie ,
and it\u00a1\u00a6s easy to see why .
the story is easy to comprehend
and many turning point are gripping ,
the actor and actress do fairly good job 
especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper ,
the hero finally gets what he wants 
and it\u00a1\u00a6s a true story .
frankly i think
the director\u00a1\u00a6s achievemant is not comparable to the spark
and heat the original story generate .
we don\u00a1\u00a6t see any special narrative or cinematography ;
the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation
the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the character .
we feel
homer\u00a1\u00a6s desire to earn his father\u00a1\u00a6s recognition
and create his own future 
and his resilience wins our respect .
\u00a1\u00a7october sky\u00a1\u00a8 reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series \u00a1\u00a7rocket boy 
\u00a1\u00a8
which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie .
actually these two work shot from two different culture provide interesting comparison .
when october sky unfold a story of a young man crying out loud
to claim his right over his own destiny ,
\u00a1\u00a7rocket boy\u00a1\u00a8 offers a more compromised description
that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society .
starring the outstanding actor yuji oda 
\u00a1\u00a7rocket boy\u00a1\u00a8 focuse on three man
as ordinary as can be :
a travel agent
who has a dream
of becoming an astronaut 
a boastful advertising agent
who is on the ink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex
resulted from the extreme success of his father and older other
( like what homer feel in his family ) ,
and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea .
the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituent and step further to force them suffocate their dream
by claiming them \u00a1\u00a7impossible.\u00a1\u00a8
to compensate for his lost ideal 
kobayashi
( yuji )
work in the tour operator
because it\u00a1\u00a6s called \u00a1\u00a7galaxy.\u00a1\u00a8
when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him ,
he finally finds strength from his father\u00a1\u00a6s word ,
who had determined to be a sailor
but later found life on the sea less attractive
as he had presumed .
\u00a1\u00a7but i don\u00a1\u00a6t regret it ,
\u00a1\u00a8 his father told kobayashi 
\u00a1\u00a7at least i tried.\u00a1\u00a8
it is his father\u00a1\u00a6s confession
that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronauthip
despite the fact
that he hurts his leg
and need to move around on a wheelchair .
kobayashi\u00a1\u00a6s effort finally fails ,
and he goes back to the travel agency .
but his \u00a1\u00a7crazy\u00a1\u00a8 courage inspires his friend ,
and everyone loves him more .
just before the end of the series 
kobayashi is on the job
as a guide of a space camp meant to let child learn more about astronaut .
after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree ,
unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board
that says :
\u00a1\u00a7astronaut wanted for 2004.\u00a1\u00a8 kobayashi look at the piece of paper and laugh and laugh 
just like a kid
looking at his ticket to disneyland .
kobayashi may never get what he wants ,
but he dares his destiny and \u00a1\u00a7just does it.\u00a1\u00a8 this series is so heart-gripping
not because the hero exhibits any heroic deed 
but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream
which make us wonder and envy .
unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writing ,
this show enlightens us and teach us something .
homer and kobayashi both have the dream ,
and they do what
they can despite other people\u00a1\u00a6s opinion .
i recommand other imdb user to see the japanese tv series .
if you are a nine-to-fiver ,
you will feel more touched .
i feel sorry
that imdb doesn\u00a1\u00a6t have its datum ,
maybe you can ask somebody from japan
to help you .
