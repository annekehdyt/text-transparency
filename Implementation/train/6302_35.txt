in some way 
the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie type in an interesting combination .
however 
no point in this movie was so obvious
that it did not deserve lingering close-up shot .
i felt
as though i had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease
killing people.the writer appears to have simply lifted clich\u00e9s from other movie as a substitute for writing line
adapted to actual character .
the actor did not help matter .
no chemistry .
i guess
they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason
that such is an essential element of these story .
however 
the writer did not work very hard
to develop the chemistry .
sure 
they are both attractive ,
but whether they are attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.the confidence turner 's character show in sabato 's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason .
sabato 's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor
who just can not seem to play by the rule .
think of the jeff goldblum character in `` independence day . ''
usually 
that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or illiance .
sabato 's character does not .
he is cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skill of a magic eight ball .
he appears to be right by random chance.the death scene
are comical .
every actor was really trying more than a little to hard
to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them .
the symptom looked like bad claymation 
sort of like that video from the 80s 
peter gaiel ,
i think .
