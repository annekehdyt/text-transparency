once again 
i was owsing through the discount video bin
and picked up this movie for $ 4.88 .
fifty-percent of the time the movie i find in the bin are pure crap
( i mean horrible beyond belief )
but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good .
this movie is much better than i expected .
i found it very engaging ,
though it was obviously made by an amateur .
the direction is nothing special ,
but the story is intriguing with some good thrill .
i expected it to be more of a comedy ,
but i was not too disappointed .
for a thriller 
this movie is surprisingly good-natured .
there is no bloody violence 
no profanity 
no nudity 
no sex .
usually 
these movie require all four of those element .
the pg rating is well-deserved
-- not like `` sixteen candle '' where the `` f '' word is used twice
and there is a ief gratuitous nude scene .
i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could have been developed more .
the film does tend to be plot-heavy ,
and the potentially good subplot are pushed off to the side .
instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them ,
we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavor .
they end up kissing at the end ,
but there is so little chemistry
that it seems forced .
`` the dream machine '' is no gem ,
but it is good 
clean entertainment .
it is quite forgettable
-- especially with a cast of unknown 
except for haim --
but it is also much better
than you would expect .
my score :
7
( out of 10 )
