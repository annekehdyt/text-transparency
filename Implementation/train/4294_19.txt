this is an in-name-only sequel to `` a christmas story 
''
originally entitled `` a summer story . ''
ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer
when they moved to a small hick-town in the middle of nowhere .
hilarity 
unfortunately 
does not ensue.the original worked
because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it .
this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all .
charle grodin 's last movie - no wonder !
it is one of his poorest role .
i felt sorry for him.mary steenburgen is given little to do 
everything 's formulaic ,
and you have to wonder
why they even bothered.and i mean ,
come on - a competition with spinning top ? !
sadly 
it is the best part of the movie ...
