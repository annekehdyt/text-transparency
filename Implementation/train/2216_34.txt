i do not remember `` barnaby jone '' being no more than a very bland 
standard detective show
in which ,
as per any quinn martin show ,
act i was the murder ,
act ii was the lead character
figuring out the murder ,
act iii was the plot twist
( another character murdered ) ,
act iv was the resolution
and the epilogue was betty
( lee meriwether )
asking her father-in-law barnaby jone
( buddy ebsen )
how he figured out the crime
and then someone saying
something witty at the end of the show.one thing i do remember
was the late 
great composer jerry goldsmith 's excellent theme song .
strangely 
the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven season
the show was on the air .
i will also admit
that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett
despite ebsen
being badly miscast .
i just wished
the show was more entertaining
than
when i first remembered it.update
( 1/11/2009 ) :
i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel .
let 's just say
that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show `` barnaby jone . ''
