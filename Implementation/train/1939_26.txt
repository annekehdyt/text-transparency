wow 
this film had a huge impact on me ,
it moved me 
.
it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia
who is sold into the sex trade .
i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl
named holly .
the setting of the film is realistic ,
the film was an eye opener ,
i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting
to help make a change with this horrifying problem
that exsists.the content of the film was very very moving .

that i have seen this year .
thegirl
