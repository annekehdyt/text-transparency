i love killer insect movie
they are great fun to watch ,
i had to watch this movie
as it was one of my favourite horror book by shaun hutson.i have met him
and i wish i did listen to him
as this movie was terrible like he said
it was 
after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was.the plot :
person are dying mysteriously and gruesomely ,
and nobody has a clue what the cause is.only health worker mike brady has a possible solution ,
but his theory of killer slug is laughed at by the authorities.only
when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea
after all.this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie !
slug in this movie are fast
( then normal )
and it looks like they fast forwarding the scene !
this movie is nothing like the book at all ,
the book was ten time scarier 
ten time gory
and had a lot more story
to it !
i did not like this movie at all !
as i am huge fan of slug the book and second book
called breeding ground !
both of book are great read the book then watch the movie ,
you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10
