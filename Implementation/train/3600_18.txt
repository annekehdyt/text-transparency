i had a feeling
that after `` submerged '' 
this one would not be any better ...
i was right .
he must be looking for champagne money ,
and not care about the final product ... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger
that sounds nothing like him ;
the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish .
it is nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money
to hire a couple talented cameraman
and an `` ok '' sound designer.like the previous poster said ,
the problem seem to appear in post-production
( ... voice dubbing 
etc . )
too bad 
cause the plot 's actually ok for a sg flick.i will never rent another sg flick ,
unless he emails me asking for forgiveness.too bad - i miss kelly lebrock ... --
