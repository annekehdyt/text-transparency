mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch .
he is a modern genius ,
because he is not only a film-maker .
his story and his style have a spell
that cross the screen .
so the straight story was quite a surprise to me 
with its easy to follow storyline and sunny set .
still 
lynch is there ,
and ,
while this is far from his best ,
it is a film not to be missed .
late richard farnsworth 's performance is one of the reasons.8/10
