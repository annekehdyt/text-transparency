this is an excellent movie .
as a canadian
who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar 
the winter 
canoeing 
trapping 
hunting and the like .
it is easy to take the familiar for granted
but after watching this film a few time
it has grown on me .the story of grey owl is well known to many canadian credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson
for expanding the story.brosnan does well portraying a complex man 
a very fine performance .
annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role .
the rest of the cast is solid .
