this horror movie is really weak ...
that is if this is the correct movie i
am commenting on .
nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little german shepard pup .
i had a german shepard
and it is a really good dog .
i did not get the idea
to get one from this movie though 
but rather from the comedy `` k-9 '' .
that is another story all together though .
this movie really does not have much horror at all
as the most horrific scene is at the end
and it looks really cheesy .
also 
we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower .
that is about it .
the father suspects something though ,
as his family seems to be getting rather strange ,
somewhere he finds out
if you hold a mirror to them
while they are sleeping you can see
if they are possessed .
all in all a really weak horror movie even by television standard ... television movie
that do work are out there
as `` this house possessed '' is pretty good
and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creature
that is also rather good .
this one is really rather dull .
