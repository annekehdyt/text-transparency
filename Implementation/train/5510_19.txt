surreal film noir released soon after the `` real 
''
genre-defining classic `` the maltese falcon 
'' `` double indemnity ''
and `` the postman always rings twice . ''
welle film should not be evaluated against other .
he was playing by different rule .
in fact 
he was playing .
this starts where other femme fatale film leave off ,
so the vaguely logical
( but interesting ) whodunit is embellished with a display of welleian scene
( typical rapid-fire style ) ,
dialog
( lot of `` hard-boiled '' philosophy ) ,
and unusual acting
( good hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional ) .
to welle `` genre '' may have meant `` formula ''
but he seemed to like using `` mystery '' as background for his `` entertainment . ''
