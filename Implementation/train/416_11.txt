unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old 
celeated english film .
although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster
( which it is not ) ,
it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origin .
richard burton sleepwalk through his role ,
and sophia loren 's closed
( in this movie )
face does not display much passion 
either .
