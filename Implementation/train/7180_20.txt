when i heard
that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie ,
my expectation
that i would watch the entire movie
were low .
the only reason
i gave
it
a chance
were the magnificent julie walter and the recommendation of a friend.what i thought
would be a oad `` mrs. doubtfire '' type of farce turned out
to be a gentle and insightful comedy .
pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man
who need to release the female part of his
being by cross-dressing on occasion .
he transmits these need to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion .
julie walter is magnificent ,
is as her habit 
as the landlady
who teaches him unconditional love .
