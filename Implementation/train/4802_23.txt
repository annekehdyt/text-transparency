this is one of my all time favorite .
it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy .
i really like a film full of good quote
and this has it ... one of my favorite is
when albert einstein says to ed walter `` are you thinking what i am thinking ''
and ed says
`` now what are the odd of that happening ! ''
in my opinion 
a film is fabulous
if you can watch it again and again
and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it ,
and with this one 
you can ! !
i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein .
i think
all the character fit together really well
and the story flows nicely .
there are so many time
that i find myself smiling right along with the film
and quoting my favorite line as i watch it !
i would recommend this movie to anyone
who has a heart
and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then !
