etienne girardot is just a character actor
-- the sort of person person
almost never would know by name .
however 
he once again plays the coroner
-- one of the only actor in the philo vance film
that played his role more than once .
i have already seen him two other time and loved him every time
because he was so funny and a eath of fresh air .
this film also is great to watch
because in addition to girardot 
there are many other wonderful character actor along for the ride
-- including grant mitchell 
gene lockhart 
henry walthal 
kent smith 
h.b .
warner and nat pendleton .
this is quite an impressive cast ,
and
they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce.these great character actor are one of the big reason
i love these old b-movie .
while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific ,
because of the eezy writing and acting ,
the film really satisfy .
as for this film 
vance is played wonderfully by lowe but ,
like i said ,
the mystery itself is only an after-thought
-- with a silly plot
involving hypnosis and suicide .
unfortunately 
you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort
-- i have training in clinical hypnosis
and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film ,
i would have done it !
used car salesman and a few of my old boss would have been obvious target ! !
overall ,
while not the best philo vance film ,
it was very good
and it is a darn shame lowe only played this role once .
in fact 
aside from william powell
( who played vance five time ) ,
the series was hindered by a long 
long succession of actor such as basil rathbone 
wilfred hyde-white and warren william
( and many other )
playing vance .
this is a similar problem
that also plagued the bulldog drummond series
-- just too many different actor
playing the leading man.well worth seeing and exciting --
though also quite impossible .
