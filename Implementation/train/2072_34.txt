i tried to like this slasher ,
like i try to enjoy all slasher film .
i mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense ,
how can you go wrong .
but unhinged i think is an example of that formula going wrong .
the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girl
that landed up in the house .
it was as if they were under sedation ,
and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight .
the film aim for suspense and creepiness but the by the number direction saps it of those ,
and leaves the movie pretty dull .
it is a shame ,
because
if the movie was better executed ,
it would have have been ace .
the story and character are pretty creepy
and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moment of interaction between the mother 
the girl 
and the daughter in the old house .
there is some good nudity ,
and occasional splashy bloodletting 
just not enough
to give the film the kick
it needed .
the finale is pretty twisted and fearsome ,
and does give the film a big lift but sadly 
its too little too late .
so 
in my opinion 
one
to avoid ,
unless you really love obscure slasher film .
there is a fair amount of potential ,
but the film deliver too little to be worthwhile .
