oh my 
i think
this may be the single cheesiest movie i have ever seen .
i am serious ,
this is one of the ultimate b-movie .
the first proof is
that it is not a $ 5 dvd .
oh no 
that is too mainstream for this .
i got this on vhs ,
from a bin full of ex-rental video at my local video store.if i may quote the blurb :
`` in 17th century japan 
there lived a samurai
who would set the standard for the age .
his name was mayeda .
he is sent on an epic journey across the world
to acquire 5,000 muscat from the king of spain .
whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapon
and almost takes their life .
mayeda must battle all odd to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan . ''
it then goes on to say `` a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continent '' i
must have seen a different movie .
this was no epic ,
and it certainly was not a multi million dollar anything .
no 
'shogun mayeda ' is really just the crazy adventure of the engrish-speaking mayeda
( sho kosugi ) .
he is not even a shogun really ,
but thats not important .
what is important ,
is that he does a really cool impression of john cleese 's repeated charging of the one castle in 'monty python and the holy grail ' ,
and his ability
to go from serious scene
to showing off his samurai mind power .
awesome.the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi 's engrish accent .
the movie may lack nearly everything
that makes a good movie ,
but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest line ever ,
delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever .
and honestly 
do you really want anything else ?
you could fast forward 'shogun mayeda ' to the end 
and replay kosugi 's final line over and over .
the tape will probably wear out
before you get tired of that one line .
awesome.2/10 - so very very cheesy .
