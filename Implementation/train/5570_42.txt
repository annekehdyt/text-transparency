following the success of the
( awful )
gilligan 's island tv movie rerun 
a number of tv movie were made in the 1980 's reuniting cast from classic show .
most of these movie completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor
that made the show so special .
the munster revenge is among the most disappointing
because it goes for a laurel and hardy-type comedy style
that really was not in the original series .
yvonne de carlo 
a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series 
is completely wasted -
she has less time here in this 90 minute movie
than she did in any single 30 minute episode .
and since the role of `` eddie '' and `` marilyn '' in this movie are nothing more than cameos ,
what was the point
of making them younger and recasting them ?
with very little rewriting 
they could have used butch patrick and pat priest .
although seeing some of the munster spooky relative was a nice touch ,
i did not enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist
mainly because there is too much of him and not enough of the underused munster
( ironically
that very year 
1981 
caesar 's old partner in comedy 
imogene coca 
was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbilly ) .
another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family
represented as wax figure at a local horror wax museum .
why would they be in there
when they are supposed to be a `` typical ''
( if strange )
american family 
not famous monster ?
this was the last munster project
featuring the original cast in their role ,
there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980 's with a completely new cast and a 1990 's tv movie
which featured decarlo 
lewis 
priest 
and patrick in cameo role as a family dining .
