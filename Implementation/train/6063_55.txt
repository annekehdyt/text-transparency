swing !
is an important film
because it is one of the remaining black-produced
and acted film from the 1930s .
many of these film have simply deteriorated so badly
that they are unwatchable ,
but this one is in fairly good shape .
it is also a nice chance
to see many of the talented black performer of the period
just after the heyday of the old cotton club
-- a time all but forgotten today.unfortunately ,
while the film is historically important
and has some lovely performance ,
it is also a mess .
the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musical of the era
-- including a prima donna
who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown
who appears from no
where to save the day .
however 
the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at time
-- and project image of black america
that some might find a bit demeaning .
this is because before the plot really gets going ,
you are treated to a no-account bum
who lives off his hard working wife
( a popular stereotype of the time )
and when he is caught with a hussy
( who 
by the way 
totally overplays this role ) ,
they have a fight
which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown !
and 
the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor
-- a trashy scene indeed !
later in the film ,
when the prima donna is behaving abominably ,
her husband punches her in the face
and everyone applauds him !
it seems like the film 
at time 
wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus
they can not even do this well
-- with some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time.still ,
if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way
( with trashy character 
bad acting and direction and poor writing ) ,
this one might be worth a peek
so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing
-- as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture .
just do not say
i did not warn you about the acting
-- it is really 
really bad !
