guy kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laugh .
like most candidate 
he knows almost nothing .
warren william 
a very 
under rated actor 
is superb in giving instruction to kibbee ;
that is 
he teaches him to say something
which means nothing to the voting public .
a campaign
based on no comment ,
`` i will take it under advisement 
''
and `` maybe yes 
but then again 
maybe no 
'' is the nearly perfect way
to win an election .
succinctly 
the dumber the candidate 
the greater the chance he
or she
will win .
after all 
the public can identify with such a person .
with respect to the movie ,
it makes for a lot of comedy .
