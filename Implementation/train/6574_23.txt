this film was probably inspired by godard 's masculin 
f\u00e9minin and i urge you to see
that film instead.the film has two strong element
and those are ,
( 1 )
the realistic acting
( 2 )
the impressive 
undeservedly good 
photo .
apart from that ,
what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness .
lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world .
she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film ,
...
it is unattractive .
comparing to godard 's film 
intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity .
without going too far on this subject ,
i would say
that follows from the difference in ideal between the french and the swedish society.a movie of its time 
and place .
2/10 .
