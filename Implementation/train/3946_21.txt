i was not sure at first
if i was watching a documentary 
propaganda film or dramatic presentation .
i guess
given the time of production
it was a mix of all three.admittedly the dramatic plot
was somewhat predictable .
but you had a sense
that there would be some interesting scene
as the movie went on .
we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimen and equipment.where this movie came together for me was closer to the end .
the scene had a realism
( at least as i perceived it )
that i have not encountered often before .
you could place yourself in the action
and imagine the thought of the young combatant .
this was mixed in with the usual problem of portraying passable japanese soldier at a time
when you might think
real japanese actor would be somewhat scarce.the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan .
also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help
the usa gave japan in past year .
