in the 60 's ,
having as the background the rehearsal and recording of `` sympathy for the devil '' in the classic album `` beggar 's banquet '' by the revolutionary bad boy rolling stone \u0096 mick jagger 
keith richard 
charlie watts 
bill wyman and brian jone \u0096 plus marianne faithful 
godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movement \u0096 the black power through the black panther 
the feminism 
the communism 
the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapter :
`` the stone rolling ;
`` outside black novel '' ; `` sight and sound '' ;
`` all about eve '' ; `` the heart of occident '' ; `` inside black syntax '' ; and 
`` under the stone the beach '' .
`` sympathy for the devil '' is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director jean-luc godard .
the narrative and the footage are awful ,
but fortunately i love the stone and `` sympathy for the devil ''
and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their career ;
otherwise this documentary would be unbearable .
my vote is three.title
( brazil ) :
`` sympathy for the devil ''
