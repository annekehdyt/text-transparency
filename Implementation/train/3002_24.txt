i was privileged to have seen some snippet from aardman 's original run of this show in the uk .
it was always fun and always funny .
none of the charm has been lost in translation
-- it is as fresh as the person interviewed --
whether some of it is scripted or not ,
as has been rumored ,
is beside the point .
it is always entertaining.aardman animation shows great imagination in the character
used for each voice 
the single aspect
that i probably love most about the show and its concept
( the hostility between the pandas ,
the porcupine discussing fear of needle 
the painting ape ) .
regular really grow on you as well 
such as the horse and donkey teen from maryland 
most every married couple
( the parrot 
the insect 
and the cat
to name a few ) and child-voiced character ,
and i have really come to dig the ferret !
monday 's finally become a day
to which to look forward .
