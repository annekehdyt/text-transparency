this movie is very much like `` flashdance '' ,
you know
that dance flick with jennifer beal .
that film is probably the most boring film i
have ever seen
since it is not even bad enough
to be funny .
`` g.i .
jane '' is much better than that film ,
but that does not say much .
here demi moore sweats a lot and there is high music
and we get to see her fight and everything ,
but it is certainly not very engaging .
i really think
the idea behind the film is kind of interesting ,
but the script is too clich\u00e9d
and ridley scott can not do anything about that .
well 
like i said ...
it is better than `` flashdance '' ...
( 4/10 )
