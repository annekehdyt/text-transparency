this has to be one of the best comedy on the television at the moment .
it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family
and turns it into a quite realistic
yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spat 
at other 
over-protective father and bimbo sister .
i am almost surprised
it is disney ! to its credit 
'8 simple rule ' know
it is a comedy
and does not try to be more .
too many show
( eg 
'sister 
sister ' and 'lizzie mcguire ' )
think
just
because its lead character are now teenager
then they should tackle social issue
and end up losing their humour
by being too hard-hitting .
this is a trap '8 simple rule ' has avoided ;
it does tackle some issue
( such as being the school outcast )
but it has fun
while doing so .
in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably
when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character.and i think ,
although john ritter will be sadly missed
since he was the reason
the show made its mark ,
'8 simple rule ' can still do well
if it remembers its humour
and does not make cate 's father a second version of paul hennessy .
