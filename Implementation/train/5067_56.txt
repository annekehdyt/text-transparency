year ago 
i found a `` bargain bin '' copy of this film for a buck or two .
in so many way 
this is quite fitting ,
as when it was made back in 1933 ,
it was truly a cheaply made film by the `` poverty row '' studio 
majestic .
however ,
while the film is rather derivative ,
it is still well worth watching
and provides a few surprises.the story is very 
very familiar 
as in some germanic town 
the person are upset
because of some recent death that appear to be the work of vampire !
adding to this familiarity is dwight frye .
he played renfield in dracula ,
and here he is very 
very similar
-- though he plays a much more harmless weirdo .
in this case 
he is obsessed with his pet bat
and person begin to blame him for the death .
the film does a good job
of providing some `` red herring ''
( i.e. 
false leads )
and while it does not take a genius
to figure out frye
may not be responsible ,
the who and why are intriguing
and make it very different from the average horror film .
in addition ,
while the production had little money to speak of ,
it still had some good actor of the day
-- lionel atwill and melvin dougla --
and it also used universal studio set at night (
when they were done filming for the day ) .
as a result 
the film looks pretty good overall ,
though i also thought
that 
as usual 
fay wray was terrible
-- thought
it did not noticeably detract from the film .
i have seen her in more movie than most person on imdb and i have come to notice
that her character have no depth
-- she alway seems to be cast as the `` screaming lady ''
and provides little new in each film.overall 
for fan of old horror film 
this is excellent
and worth seeing .
for person
who are not fan of the genre ,
it is probably pretty skip-able .
