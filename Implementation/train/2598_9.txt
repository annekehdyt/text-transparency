unique movie about confused woman
( lindsay crouse )
who gets involved with sharp con man .
joe mantegna gives an oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group .
absolutely enchanting first hour ,
as mantegna shows crouse `` the rope '' of his con game .
story line unravels a bit later on ,
but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world .
definitely worth a shot .
