this 
and immoral tale 
both left a bad taste in my mouth .
it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex ,
and these two film are cautionary tale about what will happen
if you do have sex .
as a film 
it is not very well done
-- some of the acting is truly epically bad
( such as the `` american '' woman with the french accent ) .
the young woman 's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage
to being interested
( when it seems like it should have been the other way around ) ,
and the aunt 's sudden realization of the young man 's secret do not make sense
-- they are not explained at all .
i also did not like how the daughter 's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family 's perversion or predilection for bestiality .
the central idea 
the idea
that there is this `` sexy beast 
''
if you will ,
that lives in the wood ,
could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story ,
but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty 
sex-negative 
morality play .
