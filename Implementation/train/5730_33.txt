the only reason
i
even gave it a 1/10
is because the option
to give it zero out of 10
was not allowed .
this was the biggest waste of time i
have ever endured .
for roughly 75 minute 
you are subjected to the worst acting
( and i do not mean that in a good way either 
like as in killer nerd
which had great horrible acting )
and a plot
that is not only ridiculous
but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre .
the reason i
even rented this piece of crap
was because it has massacre in the title .
that said ,
there was only one killing in the entire movie
and it was pretty lame at that .
you spend more time
watching the kid bickering
and doing yard work than anything .
speaking of the kid ,
the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery .
did i mention
it was shot on video as well ?
if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life ,
then by all mean watch it .
but if you savor your hard earned dollar and time ,
then stray as far away as possible .
