from the very beginning 
the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed ,
that the outcome is entirely predictable .
any good textbook on writing screenplay will advise layering of character 
incorporating character arcs 
and three act structure .
in this film you will find none of that .
the police are the baddy ,
and consequently are shown as shallow 
incompetent and coward .
it never seems to occur to the maker of this film
that police might be honourable citizen
who see joining the police as a good way
to contribute to the wellbeing of society.the viewer gets no opportunity
to make up his or her mind
on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain .
the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse ,
but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence .
we see him walk through the door of a gaol ,
but only know
that he has been inside for three year
when we hear this much later in some dialogue.this film
contains many shot of ned
looking at the camera with a serious expression .
i found the film a real chore to watch .
it is the direction for modern film ,
and this one put me off watching any more .
