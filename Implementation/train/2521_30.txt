this movie is another one on my list of movie
not to bother with .
saw it 40 year ago as an adolescent ,
stayed up late
to do so ,
was very annoyed to find
that it was about 95 % romance,4 % everything else 
1 % history if that .
it is what i call a bait and switch movie 
one with an interesting title ,
the actual movie is a scam .
this is a subject
which deserves a good cinematic treatment ,
this movie is almost an insult to those
who served .
the actual member of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor
were they the product of abusive home ,
they were in reality idealist
who wanted to do something
to help france .
and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background
than tab hunter 's character .
flying school is not for the smart aleck
and the know it alls ,
an individual such as the one portrayed here would not have lasted two day ,
it would have either been the stockade or the infantry .
discipline in the french army was often rather fierce .
in short 
another hollywierd version of an historical episode
that deserves proper treatment .
