the original movie 
man from snowy river 
is one of the best i have seen 
nearly perfect .
a lady and the tramp storyline in two sense
-- rich girl/poor boy 
and ability vs. bloodline .
the sequel 
however 
is not only a shameless attempt
to capitalize on the good name of the original
but also a ridiculous 
overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as `` rambo meets the black stallion . ''
without the charm of the black stallion .
the young hero comes back from a 3-year absence ,
and suddenly he is superman on horseback ;
in the original 
good film 
he was real and believable ,
but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel .
i have hardly been as disappointed in a movie ,
and at time this thing made me quite angry
-- they missed hardly a clich\u00e9 .
brazen audience manipulation
-- do studio head
think
that
all you have to do with a horse-loving audience
is put pretty horse in front of them ,
to make them happy ?
a mess of a movie .
