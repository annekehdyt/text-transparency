an old man
who lives in the mountain wakes up one morning
and loses his cat .
he wanders the wood to witness a murder
but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind ?
is he just getting old ?
the movie so great
because the viewer has to make up their own mind
on what is going on .
there is very little dialog in this movie
but it does not need word ,
the whole movie speaks for itself .
you knew
what was going on and i liked it.the other part
that i liked were the shot of the wood in late fall and winter .
those were pretty
but the only thing i did not like was the view of the old man in his underwear .
he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that ,
it was a pretty deep movie .
