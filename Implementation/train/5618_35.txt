i really love this show ,
it is like reading a book and each chapter leaves
you wanting more .
it gets you thinking
about what is going to happen in the next episode ,
and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendhip throughout the year .
after each episode ends
it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth
knowing
that :
one -
the show was good ,
you can not wait for the next episode
and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friend throughout the twenty year .
and two - the fact
that the show has been put `` on hiatus ''
and we will not see the show finish
in it is entirety .
fox obviously do not know
what they have done ,
they claim
that they are losing viewer in the 18 - 49 category
they clearly do not know what person want to see
if they got rid of a good show such as `` reunion '' .
i have one query
though
that i would like to raise .
if they were to ing the show back
and it went on for another season
how would it work
since each episode is done in the period of a year
and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty year ?
your answer are most welcome .
bring back reunion !
bring back reunion !
