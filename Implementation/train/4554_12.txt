the 74th oscar was a very good one .
whoopi 's work as emcee was very funny 
and light .
i personally loved her last apperance ,
which garnered some frigid review due to coarse language and salacious joke ,
but that is fine .
the audience seemed to like it .
halle berry 
denzel washington 
ron howard 
woody allen 
and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to remember .
