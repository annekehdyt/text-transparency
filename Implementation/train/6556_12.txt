i just saw this movie on tv..i have lost my dad
when i was young and this movie surely did touch me..i can feel the lost
that the little girl desi felt..the feeling of wanting to see her father again..wanting to talk to him..or at least given the chance
to say
goodbye..and i am so touched with the letter
that was wrote back to her..saying
that her father read her letter ,
and sent it back to someone to reply her
and buy her a present
because there is not a shop in heaven..it
just lets me feel
that miracle do exist..
