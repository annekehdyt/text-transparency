this italian film from the '70 's is not even in the class with dog soldier 
the howling 
or even that awful american werewolf in paris ,
but ... it is fun to watch .
i am talking about watching the lead actress 
a stunning blonde 
run amok in her birthday suit .
we are talking about graphic 
complete nudity ...
it is obvious
that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma ! !
the story is a hoot ,
the sfx are childish ,
and the acting
( for the most part )
stink .
the only redeeming value of this movie is all
( and there is a lot )
the nudity and sex scene .
tame by hbo standard ,
but still fun to see
when you find yourself without a date on saturday night .
ok ... here is the spoiler ...
there is no werewolf
( except in the opening scene of the heroine
( ? ?
) 's ancestor .
the girl just imagine
that she is a werewolf ... in other word 
a clinical lycan nothrope .
