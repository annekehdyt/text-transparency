the most horrible retelling of a great series .
it should not have been named battlestar galactica ,
because it is only the same in name alone .
too many change to just have change .
you have character turned from male to female 
black to asian to cylon all in a way
to `` attract female audience 
''
when there was already strong female character
that could have just been made stronger .
gone are the egyptian feeling .
gone are the quest for earth .
the lack of cylon to go to terminator reject takes away from the film ,
especially when one is made a fembot .
granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it ,
but it had a large following .
they tried to hold onto this following
but give the fan nothing to work with and basically spit in their face
as they make it `` their own story . ''
change are good ,
when they make something better ,
not to just make them .
