must have to agree with the other reviewer .
this has got to be the worst movie ,
let alone western i have ever seen .
terrible acting 
dialogue
that was unimaginative and pathetic
( let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s ) ,
and oh 
did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the character ?
i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene .
and the ending ?
the least i can say
is
that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ...
completely awful .
and yes 
it did contain every clich\u00e9 in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable `` let 's remember
when '' shot when a main character dy .
luckily i saw this on free tv .
do not waste your time .
