this is a family film ,
which to some person
is an automatic turn off .
it seems that too many person do not want to see film
that are not loaded down with failing arm and leg 
gratuitous violence and enough expletive
to fill the new york phone book .
this film is none of those .
it is clich\u00e9 ,
it is formula ,
but it is also fun .
it does not ask you to think ,
it does not demand
that you accept the film as reality .
it simply does what a good film ought to do ,
which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hour and enjoy the adventure .
the cast is good ,
while not excellent .
as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was 
as usual 
excellent .
and the fact
that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp
made it even more believable .
it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some month due to the challenger shuttle disaster ,
which may have played a large part in it is original theatrical opening ,
but the film eventually has helped to focus the dream of many young person back towards space and the possibility
that lie therein .
so sit back with your kid and prepare to enjoy .
