nothing in this film
interested me .
i thought
the actor were asleep
while they were performing .
that is not laid-back stanislofsky method ,
that is just walking-through and saying line ,
i am afraid .
kidman 's performance is sad .
the story is 
however 
mildly entertaining
if you want to put up with the bad acting .
