frailty is a non-gory horror film
that achieves its chill
by following the logic and impact of a man 's delusion/obsession straight into depravity .
dad
( we never learn his name )
is a gentle man and loving father
who 's raising his son alone
after mom died giving birth to the youngest son 
adam .
the family 's world flips upside down late one night
when dad rushes into the boy ' room
and tells
them god has given him a vision .
and what a vision \u0096 the entire family 's job is to destroy demon ,
who 
of course 
are disguised in human form.proceeding from this premise ,
the movie is unflinching in following it .
dad kidnap people/demon
whom god has told him to destroy 
binds them ,
lays his hand on them
to see a vision of their evil ,
then kills them \u0096
while making his young son watch .
fenton 
the older boy 
is horrified ,
seeing only a father
who 's turned into a crazed murderer .
adam 
the younger 
is uncomfortable ,
but trusts
that dad is following god 's will .
eventually 
dad takes his son on mission to abduct the `` demon ''
that god has put on dad 's list ,
and finally 
invites them to fully participate in god 's mission for the family.this is not ,
you understand 
an abusive father .
he loves his child .
he is only following god 's instruction :
`` this is our job now 
son .
we have got to do this . ''
when fenton 
terrified and convinced his father has gone mad ,
says
he will report him to the police 
his father explains ,
`` if you do that 
son ,
i will die .
the angel was clear on this . ''
the pressure
that the child are under
is unbearable and tragic 
and warps their entire life .
( 1 )
the movie 's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspect :
a story in flashback 
told in a police station to a fbi agent .
the moody lighting 
the stormy weather 
and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory .
i wanted to believe
the unfolding horror was just a story ,
until i remembered the real-life parallel of andrea yate ,
who believed
she was possessed by satan
and could save her child by drowning them .
even then 
i wanted to believe
that i was watching a human tragedy ,
rather than a story of divine retribution.the movie gave me no such comfort 
though ,
as it gave strong clue at the end about the veracity of dad 's vision .
and this ,
as much as some plot hole ,
posed a problem for me .
regardless of the accuracy of dad 's vision ,
regardless of the evil
that his victim may have committed ,
where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death ?
