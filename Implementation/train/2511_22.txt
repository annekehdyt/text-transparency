christ .
a sequel to one of the most cloying film of all time 
this at least has the decency
to leave out the song
( bar a reprise of the unbearable `` tomorrow '' )
but does continue the tradition
of being nauseating and unfunny .
this time 
annie and her friend head off to london and get caught up in joan collin 's plot
to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite .
the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odd with how irritating she is :
every time the little bugger squeal `` leapin ' lizard ! ''
i could feel
my tooth grinding themselves down into powder .
drearily photographed 
slushy and plodding 
the movie has only one memorable line
( `` unhand me ,
you stupid genius ! '' )
and the fact
that it is not the original
to recommend it .
