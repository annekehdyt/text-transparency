quite possibly the nicest woman in show business ,
and the sexiest 
debbie gives another fine performance here .
although her work in american nightmare was far superior ,
she is still worth
watching in this film.the cast is filled with your typical melrose place type 
chiseled feature and seductive curf ,
that i had never seen before .
other than debbie 
laura nativo was the only actress i had seen
before 
in the similar delta delta die.the plot center around a group of california arrogant
who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique .
they tell her
that they have a murder club ,
and that she must kill someone to be accepted .
debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool person ,
so she quickly kills a person ,
and now the group must decide what to do with her ,
after she fell for their joke.violence :
$ $ $ $ $
( plentiful !
debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her
and all of the murder scene are done in your face .
gore hound will surely enjoy !
)
nudity : $ $ $ $ $
( plentiful as well !
debbie rochon has several nude scene as do many of the no-name actress and actor .
the pool party seems as just an excuse
to get everyone naked ;
man and woman alike .
julie strain also has a topless cameo
but her character is gone after the first five minute ) .story :
$ $
( could have received a higher vote
because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scene .
i understand
that b-rate film use nudity often ,
but this is borderline excessive )
.acting :
$
( the acting is sub standard
to say the least .
rochon is always a treat 
easily the best b-rate actress in the business today ,
but her character in american nightmare was superior .
danny wolske does a fine job as debbie 's object of lust
but the other actor were nothing to write about ) .
