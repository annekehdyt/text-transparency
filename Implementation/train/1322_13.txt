saw a trailer for this on another video ,
and decided to rent
when it came out .
boy 
was i disappointed !
the story is extremely boring 
the acting
( aside from christopher walken )
is bad ,
and i could not care less about the character ,
aside from really wanting to see nora 's husband get thrashed .
christopher walken 's role is such a throw-away ,
what a tease !
