the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor .
a visual treat to the eye ,
the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart .
i was intrigued 
at first 
by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion
in order to `` find '' their capacity for love .
what follows is a huge disappointment .
boyer is the only real actor in the production
and one feel his torment .
dietrich 's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance
-- at time her face is frightening to look at --
a unfeeling mask .
as a monk 
boyer held the formula for the monastery 's liquer
( which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse )
-- when he leaves his `` marriage to god '' the reaction by his fellow monk holds the shock and fear
that perpetuate organized religion .
the viewer feel
boyer was well rid of his past .
however 
the journey
that follows
is all too predictable .
