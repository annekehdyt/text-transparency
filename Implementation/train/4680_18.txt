there are a lot of pretentious person out there
who will pretend
that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning ,
and that ignorant fool like me do not 'get ' it .
obviously this means
that we should stick to hollywood dross.it
has every 
a-hem 
artistic clich\u00e9 in the book - i guess
it is good that the director is one of the chosen few .
almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.the director of the
( almost equally embarrassing )
movie 'ratcatcher ' return with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense ;
it is difficult to understand
and apparently is a study of alienation .
the best way
to describe this film
is alienating for its viewer .
