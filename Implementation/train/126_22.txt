i just got this video used and i was watching it last night .
the acting started out extremely bad
( hey

twister )
but got very good soon after ward .
the tornado looked extremely fake ,
and many of the cgi effect were very dodgy ,
but the scene with the house cracking apart
and the content inside being blown around
and sucked out were extremely well done ,
and just about on par with movie like twister .
the scene of devastation were also extremely well done too .
the story was very well written ,
and it is refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old `` disaster formula '' movie of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality 
this merits an a in my book .
