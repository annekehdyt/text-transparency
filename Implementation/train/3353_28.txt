i am a huge fan of the duke of hazzard tv show .
and i really enjoyed this flick .
i enjoyed myself here a lot
more than i did with other summer blockbusters.it
is funny hearing person rail against this movie with excuse like `` lame plot ''
and `` it is much cruder than the show . ''
does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode ?
daisy makes incest joke and bo says
that luke had probably fathered half the kid in the orphanage .
the only reason
it was cleaned up is
because it changed to and earlier time slot.and as far as the plot goes .
it was the perfect duke plot .
in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show
that has migrated to the big screen.while sean william scott and johnny knoxville
are not exactly like their small screen version ,
they do a great job
and work very well together .
i was not too keen on burt 's boss hogg though .
and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe .
in the movie roscoe is a little ... scary.and
who did not have a smile on their face
as the general lee is racing through the street of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard ? folk ,
allow yourself to enjoy a movie
that is just an excuse for nostalgia 
bikinis and car chase ,
you will not be sorry .
it is just a great dumb movie !
