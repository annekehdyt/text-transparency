i had somewhat high hope for this since i like tim roth .
i was not pleased with this film .
i liked the ang lee the hulk a few year back
so i figured
this would have more of a bang to it .
first i was very disappointed with john hurt 's performance here .
he looks
as if his eyeow were re-shaped for this .
his performance was not convincing .
he was not as good
as one would expect .
tim roth is cool as always here .
the gama thing did not really stick to the original story line
i
do not think .
i guess
the best part of the film was the end .
it had some cool action .
the only problem with the original was
that
it was too long .
this one is not as long
but it got a bit boring at time .
i remember some time ago
when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale
and i always wondered why ? .
now i know .
i was hoping to to get blown away ,
but i was not .
