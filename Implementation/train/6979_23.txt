i first heard about white noise
when i saw the tv advert .
before then i did not even know it existed .
i watched the trailer online
and decided
that i would go and see it .
now being a fan of film like the sixth sense ,
i thought
that this film would give me everything i wanted .
it has michael keaton in it ,
and he rocks .
unfortunately the film did not deliver .
it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echo 
and failed miserably .
it has a very promising start ,
but the middle just drag on repeating itself ,
and ends with a completely poor twist
which any monkey could have figured out .
unfortunately like most `` scary '' film nowadays it relies on loud noise and bang
to make the audience jump .
this film could have been so much more .
it is a shame
because it was a good idea .
