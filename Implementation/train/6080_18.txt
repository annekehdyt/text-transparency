it is very sly for all of the 60 's look to the movie .
the humor is quite gentle ,
but it grew on me much more than i expected .
the cast is first-rate
and they appear to be having a wonderful time .
ustinov wander through the film muttering some quite funny thing under his eath ,
and it is all very inconsequential ;
i will buy the movie
as soon
as it comes out on dvd .
the plot is that ustinov as an embezzler released from prison
posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an american company with an office in london .
maggie smith is his secretary for a while ,
and watching her get fired from many different job is part of the fun .
bob newhart is his usual deadpan self ,
and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive
running the london office .
the ending is funny and nicely cynical .
