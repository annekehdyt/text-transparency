the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute 's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend .
there are a couple of other minor story line
that might actually be more interesting than the one taken ,
but they are not fully explored .
the core of the movie is the funeral 
wake 
and later controversy over the future of a community of crone
that make doll and sell them to buy vodka
but are now missing the artist
who made their doll marketable .
apparently 
the movie is unedited .
the prostitute 's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud .
maybe that is supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape .
the village itself ,
such as it is ,
is inhabited by a legion of widow and one male 
the consort of the dead girl .
continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved
and eventually seems impossible .
most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera
that could induce nausea .
another problem for western viewer is that subtitle do not include the song and lament of the crone .
do not go to this movie
unless
you are fluent in russian .
