in spite of sterling work by the supporting actor ,
and an intelligent script by alan plater 
this film suffer from a fatal flaw
- the lack of charm of the central character/actor .
one of the character describes richard e grant 's character as `` a whining little turd ''
and unfortunately this sum him up perfectly .
there is nothing about him or his performance
to make it credible
that his girlfriend and upper-class publisher/friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him .
he is rude 
arrogant 
selfish 
self-destructive and thoroughly annoying .
the part called for an actor
who can make you love him
even when he is being a prate - a ewan mcgregor ,
for example.all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted 
thank to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance .
all i wanted to do was shake him
and tell him to get over himself .
