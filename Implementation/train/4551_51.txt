this is a movie
that gets better each time i see it .
there are so many nuanced performance in this .
william tracey 
as pepi 
is a delight 
inging sharp comic relief .
joseph schildkraut as vadas 
is the only `` villian '' in the movie ,
and his oily charm are well used here .
frank morgan 
is delightful as the owner of the title shop 
mr. matuschek ,
and his familiar manner is well used here .
i especially liked the performance of felix bressart 
as pirovitch .
very believable in every facet of his role.the two lead are equally accomplished ,
with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate 
neurotic 
yet charming and attractive woman.this movie belong to jimmy stewart though .
the movie is presented from his point of view ,
with the action rotating around him .
mr. stewart is more then up to the task
of carrying the movie 
with an amazing performance
that uses a wide range of emotion .
just watch stewart ,
when he is fired from his job ,
because of a misunderstanding .
he is able to convey the shock 
anger 
fear and embarrassment
that so traumatic an event cause ,
so perfectly .
in my estimation 
jame stewart is ,
without question ,
the greatest film actor in the history of the medium .
there is no one else
that has ever been captured on film
that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience .
at the time he made this movie ,
he still had most of his career ahead of him ,
yet he is completely the master of his craft .
this is one of jimmy stewart best movie ,
and also one of the sweetest 
most enjoyable romantic comedy
you will find .
i greatly recommend this movie 
especially for those
that appreciate the work of stewart .
