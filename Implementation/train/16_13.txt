during the whole pirate of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount picture really dropped the ball
in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b. demille supervised movie
and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extra included .
it is obvious to me that paramount picture execs are blind as bat and ignorant of the fact
that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate
who actually lived in new orlean 
louisiana
which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous
for it is pirate connection .
when the execs at paramount finally get with the program
and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper .
paramount picture it is up to you to get off your duff
and get this film restored now !
