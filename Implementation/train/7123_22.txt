bad .

bad .
those three line sum up this crappy little film
that can only attract idiot child and their parent to the cinema .
and its ... # 1 movie in america !
what is this country thinking ?
mike myer looking more like micheal jackson .
some chineese lady
that falls asleep within 3 minute .
a lame plot with dirty joke .
it is grotesuque and awful .
when green-eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i will be so happy !
( not )
eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipster trying to find the lost green-eggs and ham .
they will try to chase sam-i-am
and that mean guy
who are running away with it .
( i hope
they do not ruin the classic book . )
do not waste time and money
by seeing this .
