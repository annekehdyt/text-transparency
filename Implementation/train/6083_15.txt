this movie is about a side of ireland
that american do not normally see 
the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world ' .
the movie 
by the admission of the inhabitant of fethard
who are old enough
to remember the event ,
is fairly accurate
( though they insist
that the film-maker invented some of the more violent scene just to spice up the action )
.the movie was very unpopular in ireland
as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light ,
but the simple fact is that representative of the catholic church *did* organise veto of minority
( before protestant it was the jews )
.the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
