the killing in this movie is not that bad ,
but for sure the movie is .
it is even worse than that .
it is not even worth the wear
it might cause
when you slide it into your dvd-player.not even the wear
it causes on your shoulder
carrying it from the dvd-store 
not to speak of the money and time you spend renting
and watching it .
horrible.it is beyond understanding
how anyone could say anything positive about this movie .
it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine
that caused me not to stop watching ,
add to that the group pressure from my co-watchers.the manuscript is awful ,
the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable.i hope
you do not see this as a spoiling your fun ,
i would rather see it as a fair warning :
do not waste your time
watching this garbage !
