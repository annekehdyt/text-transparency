if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer ,
it comes across as decidedly average.a journalist [ duchovny ] travels across country to california to document america 's most famous murderer 
unaware
that one of his white trailer trash travelling companion [ pitt ] is a serial killer himself.rather predictable throughout ,
this has its moment of action and pitt and lewis portray their role well ,
but i would not bother to see it again .
