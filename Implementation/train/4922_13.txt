if you are studying welle
and want to see just how far he fell
after citizen kane 
this film will prove it .
the cheap excuse
of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy
to explain
how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails
to explain the absurd courtroom theatric and ridiculous plot twist
that eventually ensue .
do not be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db
as i was ;
all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welle and hayworth fan out there .
