first 
a little summary .
this reporter named torch
is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outeak
and finds the military and government censoring him .
nice message 
government censorship and all that ,
but the way
they did the movie was ,
well let me explain.this movie is beyond description .
the idea
that somebody holds it in higher regard
than anything by george romero
is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution .
the script is atrocious on its own ,
like it was written by a sixth grader.as for special effect ,
i understand
that independent film have low budget ,
and some gore effect looked acceptable ,
but
if you want a scene with fire ,
here is a tip :
buy some nonflammable material ,
have an extinguisher ready ,
and get a fire going !
do not digitally add it in
and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game .
the acting 
well let 's put it this way .
in my summer theater program 
a cold reading of the script is ,
compared to this 
the godfather .
i will not even go into the inconsistency .
find them yourself.what disturbed me the most 
though ,
was when everything was finished after shooting and editing ,
somebody might have said 
`` okay 
this looks good .
let 's release it . ''
it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it ,
to think somebody felt
that this was good enough for dvd release .
this is not dvd quality .
this is not sci-fi channel quality .
hell 
this is not even film school quality .
if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school ,
you would get an f. no 
not even an f 
more like an f- .
i would not be surprised
if he would try to get you expelled.i felt
used after i saw this thing .
blockbuster and the maker of this movie have my money right now ,
and i would prefer not to think of what they are doing with it .
i have been the pawn of some elaborate 
nefarious scheme at legalized theft ,
and it does not feel good to think
that i walked right into it ,
looking at the back cover with pleasant memory of 28 day later
only to find a film ed wood
would watch
and say afterward ,
`` i did not much care for this . ''
this film is the single most terrible
movie
i have seen .
i have not seen anything by ed wood ,
but i have confidence this is worse .
if you are looking for serious cinema ,
so much
as being within ten foot of it will probably give you a bad headache .
if not 
i still recommend
that you personally write the director
and ask
how he sleeps at night .
however ,
if you are the kind of person
who get a laugh out of really bad stuff
then i recommend you check this out .
you will not be disappointed .
