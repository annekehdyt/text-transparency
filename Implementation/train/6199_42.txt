hey now 
i can not claim to have seen all of the film of jesse
( jesus )
franco ,
and there sure seem to be a lot of them ,
but this is one of the better
( and weirder )
of the lot
that i have seen .
i would say
most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties/early seventy
and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me ,
and it takes a lot for me to declare that .
anyway 
this is like one big bad dream
where part of it seem to come true at various point .
this woman is an actress or something ,
perform in some theater in berlin where act of `` fake '' torture are performed for an appreciative audience
( ? ! )
and she seems to have this problem with dreaming .
the catch
to what is real
and what is not in this movie
is apparently
the real stuff is in sharp focus
and the dream stuff is not .
she seems to exist in a state of deja vu .
i will not say
this makes a whole lot of sense
but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining .
shot of berlin make
it seem like a lonely and creepy place ,
so that adds to the atmosphere .
the ending is extremely aupt though ,
the film just ends and the tape went black ,
i guess no need to let you know
it was over at that point .
my copy was from the anchor bay euro-trash collection ,
and i say ,
give me more euro-trash ,
i can not get enough of that crap .
but it is good crap .
