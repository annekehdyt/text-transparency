well after watching this i can say
that it are not the worst movie
ever made 

yes folk there is worse than this 
,
there are some good point to the movie 
,
you get to watch drunken teenager ,
have horrible death 

and cute looking rat eating some science experiment 
and getting grotesquely huge 

the drunk janitor 

the cranky doctor 

and yes a girl in thong underwear that has absolutely no shame 

dumb jock 

i could'nt personally wait for the rat to eat these drunken fool 

i was rooting for the rat the e ntire time 

it had a good premise 

the first part of the movie 

was interesting though with the scientific explantation about the rat 

and the little back story 

but i think
that it ruined when the dumb drunken horny teenager come into play 

the rat in my opinion 
the one
that get 's lost 
,
her name is brenda ,
was so fake 
,
must have been a cgi rat 
,
looked like a guy dressed up in a beaver suit 
,
this was pretty schlocky 
lame 

but not totally horribble 
,
