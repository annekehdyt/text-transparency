cusack does his best david niven in this one ,
although i do not know
if anyone besides me noticed it.when
seen with this in mind ,
its a deliciously over saturated 'want to be taken more seriously than austin power
but still be pretty d*mn funny ' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spear lap dance version of matum bond .
the writer built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot -
interesting choice.i never knew
how soothing montel 's voice was until this movie ...
i think
he has found a new calling doing nav system voice over !
