i must say
that ,
looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student ,
brannagh 's version of hamlet is by far the best .
his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded .
it helps the play come to life on screen ,
and makes it easier for person holding the text
while watching ,
as we did
while studying it ,
to follow and analyze the text.one of the thing i
have heard criticized
many time is the casting of major hollywood name in the play .
i find
that this helps viewer recognize the character easier ,
as opposed to having actor
that all look and sound the same
that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare.also ,
his flashback help to clear up many ambiguity in the text .
such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelium really went
and why fortinas just happened to be at the castle at the end .
all in all 
not only does this version contain some illiant performance by actor both familiar
and not familiar with shakespeare .
it is presented in a way
that one does not have to be an english literature ph.d to understand
and enjoy it .
