there are some extremely talented black director spike lee 
carl franklin 
billy duke 
denzel and a host of other
who ing well deserved credit to the film industry .
then there are the wayan brother
who at one time
( 15 
year ago )
had an extremely funny television show'in living colour '
that launched the career of jim carrey amongst other .
now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gag
( toilet humour )
as the standard operating procedure .
person are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man '
they could not possibly be .
a baby with a full set of tooth and a tattoo is accepted as being only month old ?
baby comes with a five o'clock shadow
that he shaves off .
it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husband 
darryl 's 
back .oh 
yea
that is just hilarious .
as a master criminal 'little man ' is the stupidest on planet earth .
he stashes a stolen rock
that is just huge in a woman 's purse
and then has to pursue her .
co-star chazz palminteri 
why chazz 
offers the best line :
`` i am surrounded by moron . ''
based ,
without credit ,
on a chuck jone cartoon 
baby buggy bunny .
this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny .
a clue
as to how bad this film is damon wayan appeared on jay leno the other night 
prior to the bat award
and he did not 
even mention this dreadful movie .
when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayan brother .
when they get over their white man guilt in all likelihood .
