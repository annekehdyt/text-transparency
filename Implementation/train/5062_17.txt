this movie is poorly conceived ,
poorly acted ,
and poorly written.jon heder is terribly annoying ,
and can not escape the same napolean dynamite routine .
self-obsessed and ignorant.furthermore 
diane keaton plays the same manish ,
overly obsessed mother ,
who cares too much
and yet not nearly enough about the life of her child
( see
because i said so ) .
anna faris ,
though i generally like her ,
plays a vapid idiot in this film as well.jeff daniel is passable but nothing special .
please 
skip this film
if you want to keep your soul .
