it is pretty surreal what these fly can do ... eh well ...
this is a cartoon ,
so anything can happen in it.at first i must tell you that i love animated movie .
unfortunately this year 's repertoire is very weak .
this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:1 )
i quoted the tag line .
it suggests
that this movie has great 3d effect .
well 
i did not see any 
at least not something special i never saw before.2 )
the `` fly '' in this movie look nothing like real fly .
at least they could have make them black .
but cyan fly 
seriously ?
with giant head and slim torsos ? 3 )
the story .
i guess
it was written for 6 year old kid .
i could tell it in two sentence
it is so over simplified.4 )
excessive patriotism .
for example : `` they are american file after all ! ''
oh 
give me a eak .
