this movie is one of my all time favorite .
cary grant 
victor mclaglen 
and dougla fairbank jr ... what a cast .
not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din .
drama 
action 
adventure and comedy all rolled up into one .
the final battle scene still to this day gives me chill
and the ending always leaves me in tear .
if you have not seen it ,
i would strongly recommend it .
