this is a must see for independant movie fan ,
but it also holds up well against mainstream movie .
i think
we have the making of the next woody allen ortrentin tarrentino here.the budget is painfully low .
no special effect whatsoever ,
and they seemingly used ambient lighting
( shot in digital video . )
-and yet this movie grabs hold of you
and never let go .
the screenplay is somewhat bizarre ,
yet the actor and director pull it off with complete realism .
it has humor ,
it has intrigue ,
and it has pathos ,
and it all works together.no point
in describing the detail .
if you want to see an independantmasterpiece ,
a virtual lesson
in how to make a low budget flick
that really works ,
see this one.-oh yeah ,
it is also really entertaining .
