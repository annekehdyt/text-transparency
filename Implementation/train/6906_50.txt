i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day .
it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel
not exactly famous for airing good movie .
this one 
however 
was nothing less then good.october sky tells the true story of homer hickam 
a boy
inspired by the sputnick launch
to become a rocket scientist .
he and his friend begin to build rocket .
his father is not to happy about his son new found hobby
and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his other.the story is well written .
a bit too predictable maybe ,
but that is ok cause
it does not focus too much on those part of the story .
it is important part ,
but where this is obvious the inner action ,
the action between the character is focused on .
the story is good .
it has some clich\u00e9 ,
but that is ok. it is based on actual event 's
so you kind of can not just drop out these clich\u00e9 .
the character are really good .
where the story is on a downhill the character
are ought out and manage
to keep the action and the quality of the movie high .
you get to know these character
and you get sympathy for them .
they are well written
and believable.this is a good looking movie .
the set and the 50 's style is thorough
and the picture are well composed and well lit .
this all set the mood of the film
very good.the acting is really good .
jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance
as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam .
as for the rest of the cast they are good too .
all together this makes out a pretty strong cast.all in all i
am glad i caught this movie .
it was first after seeing
it i learned
that it was based on actual event .
if i had known that
when seeing it ,
it would probably just be even more interesting .
october sky is a good and interesting movie .
it is a movie i believe
everyone can enjoy .
it is kind of a feel-good movie .
not bad at all !
