this movie is awful .
at the end of it you will realize
that several hour have been stolen from your life
that you can not get back .
the `` twist '' ending is very contrived .
the character development
leading up to this ending
is not consistent with their final action at the conclusion .
ninety minute of preparation
-- with the premise
that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve --
is explained away in literally ninety second of `` no
we were just tricking you . ''
then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it !
`` i will forgive you
if you can forgive me 
''
is as upset
as he gets .
if someone took week
to convince me i was about to die
and then said
`` no 
sorry 
just fooling you '' i would raise some serious hell .
i do not feel bad
about giving away the spoiler
because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching .
please save yourself
and do not watch this movie .
