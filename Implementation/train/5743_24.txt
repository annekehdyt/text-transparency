i knew
i was going to see a low budget movie ,
but i expected much more from an alex cox film .
the acting by the two leading man was terrible 
especially the white guy .
the girl should have won an oscar
compared to those two .
this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside joke for film industry person and a few other joke
that i actually understood
and made me laugh out loud ,
which is rare .
without these laugh-out-loud momants i would have given this film 2/10 .
what happened to the alex cox
who made all the 80s classic ? spoiler :
there were a couple of question i
had
after the movie was over .
why did the mexican guy go to the other guy 's house at the beginning ?
what did his daughter say
he got 100 person fired from his last job ?
why was she eaking her own stuff
when she was mad at him ?
i guess i should have gone to the qanda after the movie ,
but i did not want to get up at 10am .
