being someone
who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movie of all time ,
and at the same time loving this student film parody 
i feel
i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing review .
this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathon
where those
who attend
have a love of the genre yet know
not to take zombie movie too seriously .
this film is a tribute to the original 
not an insult .
it is intended to be funny ,
and many other who i have heard chant for and applaud
it agree with me
that it succeeds .
especially for those of us
who have seen notld 50+ time .
watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel ,
and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody 
loaf .
