skippy from `` family ty '' play eddie 
a wussy 'metal ' nerd
who gets picked on .
when his favorite wussy 'metal ' singer 
sammi curr 
dy 
he throws a hissy fit
tearing down all the poster on his bedroom wall .
but when he later gets an unreleased record
that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal ' idol .
he first gets sucked into idea of revenge ,
but then he does not want to take it as far as sammi does .
which is not really
that far as his main victim only seem to go to the hospital .
this movie is utterly laughable
and has about as much to do with real metal as say 
`` rock star '' .
ok 
maybe a tad more than that piece of junk ,
but you get my point .
and how anyone can root for a guy
played by skippy from `` family ty '' i
have not a clue .
the cameo by gene simmon is ok ,
and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency ,
i applaud him for that 
but otherwise skip this one.my grade :
d eye candy :
elise richard gets topless
