i watched lion king more time
that all my friend put togther .
having a baby sister..
you know
how it is .
by now i memorized both the plot and the line .
after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see ...
the second one was significan notly weaker ...
then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2 ... i was like ok there we go again .
after watching the 1 1/2 i was like wow .
all my expectation
( for repetitevness )
were oken .
a truly lovely and original plot keep
you glued to your seat for the entire time .
i have noticed
that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moment
that roflmao will apply here 100 % .i definetly
recommend seeing the cartoon .
