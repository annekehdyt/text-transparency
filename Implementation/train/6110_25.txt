i think
'blackadder the third ' is the best one of the series.actuelly all the episode are funny ,
personally i really like the episode with the 'french invasion ' ,
but the one with the superstitious actor 
in 'macbeth ' is also really funny 
the way rowan keep
playing on with them
is really
( english )
humor at the highest level.actor :
'never say
that again 
always call it the scottish play ; blackadder :
oh 
so you want me to say the scottish play ?
actor :
yes blackadder :
rather than macbeth ... ! i am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work ,
but i think
he did the series of blackadder especially good.i hope rowan is going to continue his great style ,
but i think
we can count on him ,
because he is already working on a bean 2 movie ,
that will be out this year ,
i can not wait ... i give this 3rd blackadder a 9/10 rating .
