for month preceding the release of this movie
you saw
it advertised in all sort of print medium ,
so i patiently waited for its video release
to see what all the hype was about .
after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half
to watch such a horrible movie .
it essentially fails
because it is a character based movie about unredeemable character .
with the possible exception of amanda peet
( whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet )
you can not stand any of them .
the film rely on its dialogue
which is sophomoric 
moronic 
and crude .
the only slightly amusing character is eric ,
whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friend is dead on .
the final twist ,
designed to make you laugh at the three main character ,
only instead inspires the same kind of resentment toward peet .
all in all 
only rent
if you are desperate
or possess a dark sense of humor .
