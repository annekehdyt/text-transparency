this movie sucked .
the acting sucked 
the script sucked 
and the movie overall sucked .
there were two thread in the movie
that were not developed
and the viewer had to do a bit of work
to figure out what was happening.i am not saying
that it needs to be spelled out ,
but you suddenly find thing happening
and being said
as if you have the slightest clue
as to what they are .
example :
the heroine 's negative comment about the hero .
the audience is never shown
how she even knows anything about the guy
and how he is tied into her fiance 's death .
the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy 's death as well.also ,
all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guy
loading up and cocking machine gun
and that is all you see
before cutting back to the other scene .
no explanation what-so-ever about the gun and the folk with them.we gave it a 3
because we did not feel
like we wanted our time back .
it was fun to bad-mouth the movie
while watching it ,
so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment .
