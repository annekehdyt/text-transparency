no word can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the btk killer .
rating this film one out of ten compliment
this truly disastrous excuse for a film .
from start to finish ,
there was not one single highlight .
the entire thing was horrendously put together ;
the script 
acting 
plot 
lighting 
direction 
acting 
factual information 
acting 
just to name a few .
a number of scene are literally laugh-out-loud-funny 
for the atrocious way
in which the entire thing is put together .
this review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film ,
but this is not the case .
just thinking about the movie i have just seen makes my blood
start to boil .
how this film was ever granted right for production i
will never know .
i am almost tempted to actually recommend btk ,
because it is truly a stand-out in regard to how pathetic ,
and disturbingly awful it is .
i can honestly say ,
in all my year of film-going 
this is the worst .
movie .
ever .
i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage ,
and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand ,
had i known what i was in for .
zero out of ten .
