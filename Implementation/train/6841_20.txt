oh my god.. the worst sh*t i have ever
seen -this is the main thought
which came into my mind right
after watching the movie .
and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth .
though 
maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable .
i especially mean the role of h. graham .
what was that ? ? ?
in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intention of producer .
the character was played in affected and annoying way .
every time she appears it reminds
that you ' re watching a movie
and is destroying a spirit of the moment 
then whole movie
because the most time what you can see there
are her stupid faces with more stupid attempt
to create the emotion .
terrible 
do not waste your time .
