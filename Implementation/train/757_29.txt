i saw this recently with my wife
and discovered
it is better than caine believes ,
although it is not much cop .
britain 's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role ,
which is a pity
as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing .
rex harrison seems even less bothered 
perhaps unsurprisingly ,
as his character is very poorly written .
william holden is better ,
but his screen time is fleeting
and 
again 
his character is not well scripted.beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman
as i have ever seen ,
but is given very little to do ,
the film might have gained a great deal
by concentrating more on her story .
ustinov steals the show ,
but basically by playing a comic character quite out
of keeping with the film 's serious tone .
the music is poor
and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos
( his career has been based on this for decade now )
.richard fleischer has to be blamed
for not directing this more effectively ,
he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director ,
and this is one of his weaker movie .
