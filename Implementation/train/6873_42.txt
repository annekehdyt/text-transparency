this mini-series is actually more entertaining than some other with much bigger budget and grander aspiration .
sotd falls somewhere between `` kung-fu '' and `` h r pufnstuff '' on the entertainment spectrum .
if it were not so long
( nearly 3 hour )
i think
that kid would like it quite a bit .
it is got adventure 
action 
`` cliffhanger scene '' ,
and not too much romance or other `` icky '' stuff .
when you are young ,
you are not too critical of flexing rubber sword 
campy acting ,
and scene
that are repeated .
( at least two scene are repeated identically in the movie ,
just as was done in old-time serial
in order to ing the audience up to speed . )
finally 
kid are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouth of asian actor .
( not to mention the fact
that several of the leading role are played by non-asian actor . )
i was going to give this movie three star ,
but i felt like the director 
producer ,
and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project .
this movie is not art 
but ,
like painting your house ,
it actually took some time 
effort ,
and discipline to get it made.overall 
not a recommended use for your time ,
but it might keep the kid entertained
while traveling in the mini-van.oh 
yeah ... hey 
imdb !
`` dialogue '' is the preferred and traditional spelling .
your spell-checking seems to think
that `` dialog '' is the proper spelling .
while `` dialog '' is acceptable ,
both webster 's and the oed consider it an alternative form .
