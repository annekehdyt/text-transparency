i saw this movie on a westbound american airline flight .
it was so bad
it actually made the flight seem longer .
the plot had potential
( who would not love a movie about a woman
who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator
she meets ? )
but it got screwed up a million different time by really poor writing .
towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene
where a gang of elvis impersonator is on the roof of a casino reshipping
the sky thinking
he is going to return ,
then a group of star moves together to form an `` elvis '' constellation ,
which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonator ,
sending them crashing through the roof .
bad ... really bad .
which is the theme for the whole movie .
i would avoid this one at all cost .
