if there is one thing
to recommend about this film
is that it is intriguing .
the premise certainly draws the audience
in because it is a mystery ,
and throughout the film there are hint
that there is something dark lurking about .
however 
there is not much tension ,
and william ' mild mannered portrayal does not do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.collete fare much better as the woman
whose true nature and intention are not very clear .
the production felt rushed
and hole are apparent .
it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort .
the book is probably better.one thing is certain :
taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .
