this movie was bad .
this movie was horrible .
the acting was bad .
the setting was unrealistic .
the story was absurd :
a comet
that appears once in eon is set to appear one night .
most of the world 's population decided to watch this comet .
then 
the next morning everyone
but a select few of person has been turned to dust from the comet 's radiation .
person 's clothe are still intact ,
there are plant
which are still alive ,
but the person were turned to dust .
no bone 
nothing .
that ridiculous .
how can radiation incinerate person
but leave their clothe and other biological substance intact ? even better 
the comet mutated some person into zombie flesh eating monster .
their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child .
the insane clown posse scare me more ...
and they are supposed to look stupid.then
there were the survivor .
person who had been surrounded by steel
when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death .
how can steel block a comet 's radiation
that supposedly incinerates person in their track ?
equally insulting is the 60 's horror music
playing in the background through part of the movie 
or the 80 's hair rock
which serves no purpose in the film
and makes you want to shoot your television.the stupidest part of the movie 
however ,
are the character
it focuses on :
two valley girl and chakotay from star trek :
voyager .
these three character were totally unrealistic .
who would go looting the day
after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutant running everywhere ?
there were four 5 minute horror scene in the entire movie ,
and most of them were dream .
in between these scene is unsophisticated dialog
which makes south park seem intelligent .
the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful .
i could have made a better movie with four monkey and a bag of cheetos .
do not see this movie 
ever .
