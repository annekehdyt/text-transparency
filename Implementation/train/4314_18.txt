thank to a smart script and a steady hand from writer/director kevin meyer 
`` perfect alibi '' is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller .
the movie starts methodically and builds up steam as the clue begin
to reveal
that nothing is what it seems to be .
teri garr and hector elizondo are terrific
as they team up to unravel the mystery ,
reminding me of nick and nora charle 
from the `` thin man '' movie .
kathleen quinlan is excellent as alex mcarthur 's tormented wife and the character role ,
played by veteran actor charle martin smith 
bruce mcgill 
anne ramsey and estelle harris are well done
and provide plenty of light moment at just the right time .
there is even a cameo by rex linn .
in all 
i felt
like i was reading a good book by the fire .
