this movie could not decide what it wanted to be .
there were a couple of sub-plot
that for awhile made you think
these item would all come together in the end ...
but they did not .
if you want a `` alien in the frozen waste '' story ,
stick with the 1950 's version of the thing
( not the abomination
that was remade in gore-o-vision 20+ year later )
.i could not get over the fact
that the `` alien '' looked pretty much recycled from independence day .
the `` bare minimum '' set would have been more effective
if they had hired actor
who could actually act and carry off the intended mood.lot of scenery chewing with little payoff .
