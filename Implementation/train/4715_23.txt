terrible movie .
if there is one turkish film
you should avoid seeing in 2006 ,
that should be banyo .
what a waste of time .
other than couple of cheap laugh this movie achieves nothing 
nada 
zilch 
nil .
the dialog is cheap ,
and sexual clich\u00e9s are all over it .
the director needs to watch more film
before attempting to direct his own .
the red headed woman display example of what an actress should not do .
if you are interested in learning
how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting .
the only good thing i can say about the movie is 
wait 
wait ,
there is nothing good i
can say about it .
i must have really disliked it to write about it this much .
jeez !
