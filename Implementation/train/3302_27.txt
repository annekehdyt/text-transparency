i have never commented on a film before .
i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night .
i have read comment
saying this movie stays with you .
it does .
it is been almost 24 hour and i am
still completely affected .
this movie left me questioning my own self .
how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben
who is totally selfless .
i loved this movie .
i love movie
that keep me guessing
and wondering until the end .
i feel two emotion predominantly 
happiness and sadness .
an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too .
i so wanted ben and emily to be together ,
but in the end 
they were 
forever .
if you have not seen this movie ,
get it and watch it .
just make sure
you have no distraction .
you will want to see every nuance in this picture .
one for my liary .
