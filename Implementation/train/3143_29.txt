this is one of those film
that is more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective .
i do my rating
based on how much i enjoyed or was entertained by the movie ,
so i am
giving it a 4.
if i were to rate it as an academic film 
though ,
it would get a 10.it is shot in a very interesting manner 
like a pseudo-silent film with element of sound effect and reality .
it is meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind ,
and it is interesting in these respects.however ,
the film has a lot of disgusting element
to it
that i did not find all that entertaining .
they are mainly just disturbing .
it has some very interesting imagery too ,
and some interesting concept ,
but some of the character relationship
( especially between the mother and son )
are pretty disturbing.in all ,
this film will either appeal
to you or it will not .
for me 
it was interesting from an academic perspective ,
but it was not a good watch ,
and i will probably not go back to it a second time.4/10
if you are looking for entertainment .
10/10 from an academic standpoint .
