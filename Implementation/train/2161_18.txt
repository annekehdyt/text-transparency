if you are looking for a film
the portray the pointless and boring existence of middle class life
caught in a web of non-communication and false ideal ,
then this is the film for you .
if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest ,
then you should probably look elsewhere .
there are many film
that do this far better .
for example 
try some of the darker film by bergman .
the filmmaker felt
that
in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class
he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident
after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end .
if you value your time there are far better way to spend two hour 
like cleaning your house 
for example .
