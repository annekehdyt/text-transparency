daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher 
and the light fade quickly .
if not her ,
than what other reason to watch this .
five college kid are signed up
to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition .
problem are automatically occurring
when a weird homeless man is soliciting ,
and the group are short a few person .
then 
a killer is on the loose .
i honestly wanted to say
i was going to enjoy this one .
it had a fair set up 
or maybe
that was just daphne zuniga in it .
the film is too slow ,
and almost as silent as a liary .
most of the acting is below average ,
and the `` point-of-view '' moment are so old news .
acclaimed composer christopher young of such film as `` hellraiser '' and `` entrapment '' scored this 
in a repetitive cue line
that was better made for a tv movie .
still 
it seems higher than the movie deserves .
so 
other than young and zuniga 
this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel .
