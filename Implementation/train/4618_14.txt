i rented this movie for a few laugh .
i had never seen the snl skit ,
but with hit like tommy boy 
and wayne world 
it could not have been that bad 
could it ?
the answer :
it was .
this movie hardly was a means
of relaxing after a hard day at work .
i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part ,
but there was not any .
the highlight was tiffany amber thieson ,
and that just about it .
