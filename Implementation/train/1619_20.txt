i can not believe
that those praising this movie herein are not thinking of some other film .
i was prepared for the possibility
that this would be awful ,
but the script
( or lack thereof )
makes for a film
that is also pointless .
on the plus side 
the general level of craft on the part of the actor and technical crew is quite competent ,
but when you have got a sow 's ear
to work with you
can not make a silk purse .
ben g fan should stick with just about any other movie
he is been in .
dorothy s fan should stick to galaxina .
peter b fan should stick to last picture show and target .
fan of cheap laugh at the expense of those
who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b 's amazingly awful book ,
killing of the unicorn .
