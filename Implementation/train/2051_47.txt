the intruder
( l'intrus ) ,
a film
directed by french director clair denis ,
is the liberation of film .
it follows its own spirit across time 
space 
and character .
there may be a plot ,
but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd sleeve .
honestly 
it is probably better to know nothing about the film
before watching it ,
because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectation .
the film demands
that the viewer think ,
but also taunts the fact
that he or she will not gain full understanding.the human heart
is the film 's enigma .
every image question its role 
its nature 
and its form .
the heart is the intruder 
that of the viewer and that of louis .
louis ' character is played by michel subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character .
honestly 
anyone could have played louis ' character ,
if he or she possessed a wandering 
willing 
and comfortable heart .
yet subor is the one featured here ;
he becomes the film ,
his identity is inseparable from it .
many of the film 's image lingering in my mind revolve around his expression 
vocal but mainly physical.the intruder is poetic in its ability
to capture the stillness and fullness of movement 
but more fluid than any literature in the shape
it refuses to take .
`` surrealistic '' has been a term
used in describing this film ,
but perhaps `` quasirealistic '' is a more adequate term .
nothing in the film exists outside of the possibility of reality ;
the simple omnipresent score confirm
that
by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light.watch the trailer a few time
if you are attracted to visual imagery ;
see the film to see the consequence of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom .
