this movie was awful .
a catholic/superstitious/suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies.the doubting priest .
sex and the priesthood .
politic and religion .
church hypocrisy .
conspiracy involving the church .
the dawn of a new evil age .
all kind of dark magic voodoo battle between good and evil.pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice .
the story revolves around two concept :
absolution ,
better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick -
the last right a person can ask for to cleanse one 's sin
while on the ink of death ;
and excommunication 
the act
of cutting a person off from the church .
basically 
an excommunicated person can not receive absolution .
thus comes in the sin eater ,
and i will leave it at that .
throw in all the dopy thing i already listed
and you have `` the order '' .i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shot of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholic .
it also ends with heath ledger saying
( i paraphrase )
`` i am the redeemer and damner of sin 
i live on without love blah blah blah ''
/cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla `` the matrix '' .i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal
but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process .
if you want to see something
better i suggest `` the prophecy '' with christopher walken .
