what a real treat and quite unexpected .
this is what a real thriller movie is all about .
i rushed into the video shop ,
grabbed a movie
without reading the entire blurb on the back
and hoped for the best .
i was totally surprised and delighted .
i really enjoyed the actor and their character .
i thought
they all gave a great performance
and made their character realistic .
the plot was well thought out 
well written and directed .
it kept you interested from start to finish
and never got boring for a single minute.i highly recommend this movie for those
that like thriller 
especially thriller that are well paced and one
that keep your attention .
definitely a 10/10 from me .
