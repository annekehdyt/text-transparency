after high-school graduation 
best friend alice and darlene 
decide to take a trip to thailand .
whilst they are there ,
they meet a charming australian guy
named nick .
after spending some time with nick 
he asks them
if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him .
they agree .
at the airport though 
they are get busted for smuggling drug
and then get convicted for 33 year in a thai prison for something
they say
they have not done .
not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank 
an american lawyer
who lives in thailand with his wife .
word has it
that
if you have the money
he can help you .
thing start of well ,
but they still can not get out.the movie is really good
because it does not let on what is going to happen
and it is interesting all the time .
i could not believe the ending though .
it was one of those ending
where you do not know the 100 % truth ,
but you still kind of know
what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling
because of the 'owning up ' etc .
claire dane and kate beckinsale both give quite good performance here .
beckinsale performance was a little weak though .
both dane and beckinsale character friendhip is good but could of seemed stronger .
paul walker even has a small uncredited role here .
; ) anyway ,
i thought
brokedown palace was a good movie
and i give it a 7/10 .
