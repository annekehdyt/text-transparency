wow what an episode !
after last week seeing mellisa constantly making cameo about the friendship of annie and brandi i almost puked .
but that was nothing until seeing mellisa 's tirade after being fired .
seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenity
and screaming for someone
to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv .
she continued to scream at person off set
to get her clothe `` all of them '' like someone
else would wear one of her hideous outfit .
mellisa you are like 40 year old
and you still throw temper tantrum ?
then joan starts calling annie and brandie every name in the book ,
and gets up and quits the show !
both river are spoiled at who were only left on the show this long
to keep rating up .
mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview ,
just proves to america what everyone thought ,
you are a spoiled baby .
wah wah i can not get my way !
i love how annie told the camera
she could manipulate mellisa to think her way ,
and then did exactly that .
mellisa is by far the smartest contestant
and clearly deserve to win the whole game .
