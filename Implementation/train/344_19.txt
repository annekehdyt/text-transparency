but just as entertaining and random !
love it or hate it ,
but do not expect a sophisticated plot or nail-biting cliffhanger .
think of it like seinfeld ,
but without the follow-through and repeat performance of wacky character
( well ... so far ;
i have a feeling
i will develop favourite as the season continues ) .
`` creature comfort '' is not for the faint of humour -
it is meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your ain 's part .
which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program
when i get home from work in the evening :
superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of `` cute '' to the character for me
to enjoy
when i eventually look up from the computer
to see what i am missing.funnier than most of today 's sitcom 
calmer than an evening at nascar .
just the right mix of dead air and comeback .
can not wait for the next one .
