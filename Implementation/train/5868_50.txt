there is no way to confront 'zaiskie point ' from a rational standpoint or attempt
to describe
it using word and convention
you would use for other movie .
this is because
it is not a movie .
it is an idea and a feeling
that the filmmaker have
that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film .
what we see are not the unfolding of a plot 
but rather a sequence of event
that we do not see in film every day
but only imagine happening
as the background
we ourselves will supply
when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friend .
we we see is our imagination of person
that are abstraction to us- no one we know ,
but we have doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere .
so what do we see ?
event .
we see person arguing 
driving 
and inevitably 
escaping .
only the escape is from something intangible-
it is the collective situation and cruelty
that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness 
or ... human nature .
set in late 1960 los angele ,
our player act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence .
these creature are effectively blank slate
that can display any trait we can imagine
if we desire .
although the action taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible 
,
the character are not themselves criminal .
they are human being seeking a return to a familiar 
non-manufactured existence
that is beyond the normalcy
they experience everyday .
not that they are ever happy or sad ,
but they achieve a type of self actualization
when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living .
they only achieve true life in the natural world ,
even though that is the next victim of modern existence .
at the end 
'zaiski point ' is a eulogy of humanity attachment to the natural world .
as even the most desolate piece of the earth succumb to our notion of progress ,
we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit .
