i saw this movie
when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato
who later starred in different stroke as kimberly drummond .
i do not think
it is garbage .it was not meant to be a sequel to the documantary either .
its just a cute kid movie about 3 child
who go after man
trying to find the boggy creek monster .
the man get hurt
and the kid rescue them with the help of the creature .haunting shot of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat .
this is a good movie for kid ,
no real violence a few mild scare
but good fun for the young kid .
