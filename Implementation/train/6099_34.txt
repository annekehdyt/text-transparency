gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast 
a television reporter
who travels with her crew
( karen lamm and lois young )
to solvang 
california ,
to cover a danish festival .
the problem is that their accommodation have fallen through
and all hotel in town are full .
so they travel out of town to a remote location
and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller
( a phenomenal sydney lassick ) .
would not you know it 
ernest and meek partner virginia
( lelia goldoni )
are hiding a big secret in their cellar :
pitiable 
deformed 
diaper-clad `` junior ''
( stephen furst 
in a remarkable performance )
who ultimately terrorizes the girl.a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie .
it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax ,
delivering the horror in small dose until the final half hour .
the hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echo of `` psycho '' here - are great setting .
most of all 
the perverse plot involves incest and patricide 
allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality .
and yet it also becomes poignant
as we realize
junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman
but as much a victim as the girl .
the final shot is especially sad .
`` the unseen '' is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery.8/10
