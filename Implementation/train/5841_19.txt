i can see
where the film maker were going with this .
but they never really reach their destination .
it is supposed to be a homage to spaghetti western albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame . ''
but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt .
it does not have that gritty realism
that spaghetti western are known for .
the character are not vile
and desperate enough like their italian western counterpart .
and ,
failing these two point ,
it lacks the humor of a successful parody .
in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film ,
but upon completion realized
they had missed the mark so far
that it could not possibly be taken seriously .
unfortunately 
they also missed the humor mark by a mile .
a whole lotta bad movie !
