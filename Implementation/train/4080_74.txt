i chuckled a few time during this movie .
i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover
( pun intended )
.there are three segment in this movie .
the first one is supposed to be a spoof of `` woman 'grows up ' and launch career '' movie .
the tampax\u00ae box was the funniest thing in this segment .
most of the cast member are not listed here on imdb .
they are the lucky one .
few other person will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers.the second segment is a spoof of `` sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry '' movie .
robert culp has several funny moment ,
all physical humor ,
including the aforementioned handover .
after his character dies the segment sink lower and lower
as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher .
by the time she becomes first lady i
wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch `` snow . ''
i switched to pakistani music video instead .
i do not understand urdu 
or whatever language
the video were in .
it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull `` story .
`` then came `` municipalian '' with the *big* star 
half of them on screen for less than a minute :
elisha cook 
jr. 
christopher lloyd 
rhea perlman 
henny youngman 
julie kavner 
richard widmark and ... *robby benson .
* it is supposed to be a spoof of `` young cop team with hardened 
substance abusing older cop
who needs retirement *badly* '' movie .
the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive .
it was interesting seeing old rtd bus 
and a shell gas station sign 
and an american saving sign
-- none of them are around anymore .
nagurski 's `` never stop anywhere
you might have to get out the car ''
made me smile momentarily .
then they discuss how boring the young cop is .
a lot .
back and forth
about how boring he is .
that was as boring
as this description of how boring it is .
nagurski 's law number four 
`` never go into a music store
that is been cut into with an acetylene torch 
''
made me think
that the music store is a real business at the actual location
the dispatcher gave .
thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed .
young falcone
( benson )
gets shot .
a lot .
he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski .
the segment keeps going .
on and on .
and on .
it will not stop .
it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many time you wish he
had just *die* already so this thing will end .
it does not .
it goes on and on and on ... .
then a `` buffy the vampire slayer '' episode
which i have seen four time
already comes on .
thank god !
this abysmal movie ended
while i went to get the mail .
