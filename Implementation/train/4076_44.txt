if your idea of a thriller is car chase 
explosion ,
and dozen of person
being mowed down by gunfire ,
then `` house of game '' is definitely not the movie for you .
if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense 
then 
by all mean 
see it .
`` house of game '' tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer 
dr. margaret ford
( lindsay crouse ) ,
who tries to help a patient
and gets involved in the shadowy world of con man
led by the charismatic mike
( joe mantegna ) .
to say
anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense .
frankly 
i find it hard to believe anyone
who says
they saw the twist coming .
just like a clever con artist ,
this movie draws
you into its web and lulls your vigilance.the story
is taut and well-crafted 
the dialogue smart and laconic 
the acting uniformly good
( mantegna is superbly charismatic ) .
some have complained
that dr. ford is not a very sympathetic character ,
and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive .
but dr. ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ;
moreover 
her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot
( at one point ,
i believe
that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... i
will say no more ) .
`` house of game '' is a dark look at the underside of human nature
that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity .
it will hold your attention every second
while you are watching ,
and stay with you for a long time afterward .
