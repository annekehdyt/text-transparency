i just watched this film 15 minute ago ,
and i still have no idea
what i just watched .
mainly i think
it is a film about an internet sandm `` star '' of cd rom
that are about as realistic as flash cartoon online .
she is murdered by someone ,
which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agent
to investigate the death .
the local homicide division of big city 
usa is also investigating ,
though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd rom
which he claims
are as realistic `` as the real thing '' .
i know .
wow.michael madsen is the only one in the film
that has any kind of credit behind him .
he is in the film for about 15 minute ,
and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason .
i will not even explain the ending ,
because quite frankly i can not make it out myself .
but before the final scene 
we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film .
honestly 
they could have ran
that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.all in all 
stay away from this film .
i got it
because i love bad movie and i love michael madsen .
i really could have used
that 80 some minute on something else and have been more satisfied .
like ,
playing that game with a knife
where you jab at your hand repeatedly .
that for 80 minute would be much more entertaining .
