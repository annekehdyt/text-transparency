this movie is one of the most awful i
have ever seen .
not only is the dialogue awful ,
it never ends .
you will think it is ending ,
but it is not .
how long is it 
140 
160 minute ?
i do not even know .
i do know
that i will never watch it again .
it is like someone took a romantic comedy ,
took out the comedy ,
then decided to downplay the romance ,
leaving us with the pile of crap
that managed to make its way to the screen .
but do not take my word for it ,
find out for yourself how terrible this film is .
