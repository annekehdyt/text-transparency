first of all 
riget is wonderful .
good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time .
nice combination of strange 'dogma ' style
of telling the story together with good music and great actor .
but unfortunately there is no 'the end ' .
as for me it is unacceptable .
i was thinking ...
how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse ?
... and i have some idea .
i think
lar should make riget iii a little bit different .
i am sure
that 3rd part without helmer would not be the same .
so here is my suggestion .
mayble little bit stupid 
maybe not .
i know
that lar like to experiment .
so why not to make small experiment with riget3 ?
i think
the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation
( like for example `` team america '' by trey parker )
or even computer 3d animation .
i know
it is not the same as real actor ,
but in principle i believe
it could work ... only this way
it is possible to make actor alive again .
for riget fan this should not be so big difference -
if the animation will be done in good way
average 'watcher ' will consider
it normal just after first few shot of the movie .
the most important thing now is the story .
it is completely understandable
that it is not possible to create riget 3 with the actor nowaday .
so why not to play with animation ?
and ... look for the possibility
that it gives to you !
even marketing one !
great director finishes his trilogy after 10 year using puppet animation .
just dream ? i hope to see riget 3 someday ...
or even to see just the script .
i am curious
how the story ends ...
and as i expect- everybody here do.greet 
slajps :
i am not talking about the `` kingdom hospital '' by stephen king ; - )
