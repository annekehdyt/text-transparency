this movie is not only a very bad movie 
with awful actor
-- or presumed actor --

a bored direction and a story unattractive 
it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent `` giallio '' `` torso '' ,
directed by sergio martino in 1973
( two year before ) ,
one of the most celeated psycho-thriller of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world .
in `` la sanguinusa conduce la danza '' 
the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl 
with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom .
naturally 
the scene in rizzo 's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino 's film .
to put another black girl ,
another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove
that rizzo 's movie has no idea 
no originality 
no taste 
and nothing at all .
i think
that such thing are an offense to spectator .
