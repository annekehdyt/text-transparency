an excellent interpretation of jim thompson 's novel 
this neo-noir thriller has all the requisite element
-- deranged ex-boxer turned drifter 
alcoholic widow with sinister desire ,
ex-cop turned small-time crook 
and a kidnap plot destined for doom .
yet 
the film never crosses into cliche country ,
but remains fresh and intriguing .
the performance are all superb 
particularly bruce dern 's role as the wicked sleazeball 
uncle bud .
there is a tense uncertainty to the film 's movement
which 
intentional or not 
adds to the grim proceedings .
highly recommended .
