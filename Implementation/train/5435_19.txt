this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episode ever .
i am not a shakespear fan ,
but i do not believe
he ever intended his work
to be this slow paced and drab .
it is also one of the hardest movie
to find
because there are so many hamlet listed .
like i said
though this one is quite boring .
it is in black and white ,
the pacing is slow ,
and there is minimal scenery .
the actor are all dubbed too
so
that does not help .
this is the one mst 3000 i can not watch in one sitting cause the way
the guy playing hamlet says
his line can put anyone to sleep .
