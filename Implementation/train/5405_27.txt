charleton heston wore one ,
james franciscus wore one
but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth .
i hope no one casts him as tarzan .
linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movie
but estrella warren barely shows cleavage
- her hair is always in the way .
tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga
and given the adult in the audience something
to look at .
even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume
which look like a large curtain .
she is cute
but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious look and a little bitty kiss at the end .
as in artificial intelligence
which discusses inter species sex between robot and human
but never deliver - planet of the apes hint at inter species romance between the human and the apes but only hint .
lisa marie is the only ape
that dares to be sexy .
this movie has three great actor tim roth 
ms. carter and paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes
and they are fun to watch .
superlative make up
( a certain oscar )
costume 
set 
music make this the hit summer movie of 2001 .
