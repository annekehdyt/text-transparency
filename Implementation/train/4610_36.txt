this movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending ,
it is still well worth seeing .
the film begins as claudette colbert is about to marry robert ryan .
when the minister asks
if anyone has any objection ,
a guy jumps up and announce
that colbert can not get married
because she already is married ! !
colbert insists this is not true ,
but when they investigate they find
that the justice of the peace and many other remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license !
slowly 
it becomes apparent that claudette 's mind is slipping
and person around her seriously doubt her sanity .
then ,
when the supposed first husband is murdered ,
all evidence and suspicion fall on colbert.the film is an exciting mystery suspense film ,
as what i have so far described is only the first half of the movie .
what follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating .
unfortunately 
the conclusion 
though 
is a bit of a let-down ,
as the guiding force behind all this turns out
to come `` right out of left field ''
-- and is baffling
since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess
based on the information
given to the viewer .
however ,
in spite of this ,
the film was so good ,
i can even excuse the limp ending .
in particular 
robert ryan did a great job as the `` knuckle-busting '' fianc\u00e9 ,
though apart from him the other performance were also excellent .
