what a disappointment !
piper perabo is adorable ,
tyra bank is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria bello is wasted !
bello must have been embarrassed by some of the line !
the plot 
script and premise is a joke !
i
am not against silly movie ,
i think
that something about mary is a masterpiece ,
but coyote ugly is a waste of 90 minute ... ... ..
