many person here say
that this show is for kid only .
hm ,
when i was a kid
( approximately 7-9 year old )
i watched this show first .
it was disgusting for me .
i talked with other kid about this and 
sure 
other show
and know what ?
this was the measure of disguise ,
whenever we wanted to emphasize something 's silliness
( either on tv or anything else )
we said
`` uh 
just like power ranger '' and laughed .
and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fan of mmpr .
it was so strange for me
that i decided to watch it again
and try to understand why person like it .
i did not enjoy that viewing .
but it dawned upon me :
maybe i have not enough imagination ?
it may be .
however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star .
