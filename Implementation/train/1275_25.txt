this film is pretty poor .
the acting is abysmal and completely forced .
furthermore ,
by shooting the film
as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more believable ,
you can not get out of it that easily mr dir .
do not let my comment mislead you however ,
as i would recommend you watch this film ,
as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrator of such crime .
however 
the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish !
there is no other way
to put it !
it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere !
what takes place does not translate to me any feeling of desperation 
panic 
fear or dread
that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstance .
no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping ``
was that it ? ! ''
spilling from your tongue ,
and by no mean are you haunted by these boy action .
rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film
that started with potential ,
but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point.zero day indeed ... .zzzzzzzzzzzzz
