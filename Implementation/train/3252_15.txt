this is a mildly interesting late 80 's gore fest featuring some nasty slug with a taste for human blood .
if you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing
you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this .
the acting is awful
and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attack ,
but the movie is not a complete waste of time .
the special effect are actually quite good ,
and the gore is well done .
it reminded me of the remake of the blob ,
probably because of the sliminess of it all .
all in all 
you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time ,
but i would not suggest seeing this movie
unless you have got a strong stomach
and are into this sort of thing .
