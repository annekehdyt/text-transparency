for anyone
who has seen
and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line ,
the movie is a shoddy substitute .
not only are song cut ,
but unnecessary plot twist added ,
new dance sequence choreographed 
and 
let 's face it ,
richard attenborough just does not know how to film dancer.onstage ,
michael bennett 's a chorus line was just that :
michael bennett .
his idea 
his choreography 
his direction 
his gift to broadway and the rest of the world .
it was two hour of hard-hitting 
in-your-face realism
that really made you feel for these `` boy '' and `` girl . ''
the movie 
however 
lacks empathy and depth :
the actor look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning .
every move 
every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned ;
michael douglas 
especially 
as zach is too in control for us
to believe
that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer .
even when he throws his temper tantrum ,
you never quite believe him
because every gesture 
every accented word 
every nuance is so obviously rehearsed .
and as for him not dancing :
kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway .
michael bennett loved his reading ,
but kline could not dance and ultimately lost the part .
how i wish they had done the same for douglas !
a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobody ,
and aside from a few recognizable faces
( vicki frederick ,
who played cassie on broadway 
as sheila and khandi alexander 
of tv 's newsradio 
as one of the many auditioning dancer )
you are not supposed to know any of these person .
because you do know these person .
having a star in any of the role
is a terrible decision :
when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girl and boy on the line and their story ,
you lose something.it is truly unfortunate
that the best sequence in the show
( montage :
hello twelve 
hello thirteen 
hello love )
is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song
entitled `` surprise 
surprise ''
that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscar .
cassie 's `` mirror dance '' has a new song and tragically boring choreography
-- one wonders why
they bothered to shoot a movie version at all
if
they were going to mess with a working formula this much.for fan of musical theatre and those
who enjoyed the stage version ,
this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved .
for those
who never got to see the original production 
either on broadway or on tour ,
this movie is the only reference
they will have to go by .
and they will have to wonder
just how it got to be the longest-running musical in broadway history
-- until a little show
called cat overtook
it in the late 1990 's .
but that is a different story ,
and do not even get me started there .
