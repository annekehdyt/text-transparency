well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb. ,
do you get it ,
this movie has made me come
and warn all the good soul
who will stop ever experimenting with movies.as most of them
have given their comment i thought of watching this movie
because it seemed to have some decent actor ( though having read worst critic against this movie )
i thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick. 
well it all started well with some ahem. 
comedy ... . then it all started going pathetic ... man you can believe your self 
you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time
the pathetic looking woman
called the heroine of the movie is made helpless ... huh~~ well how much can a person digest a sick all possessive witch kinda ghost
trying to do all
she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing.the next worst thing about the movie is 
the `` zombie '' hero 
yes
as he looses his fianc\u00e9 he roams around like a goat 
with black mark under his eyes. ,
and with the hero 's `` terribly stupid '' sister.. you wud be bleeding from head to toe
if you attempted
and succeeded by completely watching this movie~ !
