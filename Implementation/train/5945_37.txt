this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century ,
but it is worth it for the message
that it conveys 
chiefly the consequence and ramification of technology upon society ,
specifically when that technology is used for warfare.this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization
and therefore serve as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology ,
but as the circle completes itself ,
familiar theme and sentiment pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive way
that humanity may utilize technology.brilliant for it is time ,
the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some 
but as a landmark in the history 
development 
and evolution of the sci-fi genre ,
it is a must .
in the end 
free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means
for controlling our own destiny
rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed ,
the state ofsociety itself ,
as shaped by world event.those
who are downtrodden by what life
throws their way
sometimes tend to remain so ,
but yet there is alway a glimmer of hope and continuity
that remains ,
as this film posits.as far as qualifying as sci-fi 
one of the biggest common demoninator of that genre is it
is speculative nature .
it asks us the question ,
what if these event happened this way ,
and what effect would it have on society or the individual within it ?
how would we react ?
as far as influence ,
this film project those speculative science
that make sci-fi as unique as it is
and keeps us
asking those important question .
