like a relative
that gives you a bad gift ,
soul survivor has its heart in the right place
but trips up with a bad execution .
stephen carpenter 's writing/directing effort borrow freely from other 
better film 
such as jacob 's ladder and ae los ojos
( open your eye ) .
for those
who have not seen either of these film ,
i will not give the premise away ;
suffice to say
it is not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior film.melissa sagemiller star as cassie ,
about to go away to college .
her current boyfriend sean
( ben affleck )
and ex-boyfriend matt
( wes bentley ) ,
both friend 
and annabel
( acerbic eliza dushku )
are in a car accident
after being pursued by two killer
( ? )
in transparent mask .
she survives the wreck ,
but while attending college has vision of the hospital ordeal and dead person reappear and disappear ,
leaving her in a state of total confusion :
who is dead ?
who 's alive ?
what is real ?
soul survivor has the look of a bad been-there 
done-that 
gore-filled 
blood-splattered 
body-stacking teen exploitation flick .
true 
it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scene
( plentiful 
repetitive 
and mind-numbing ) ,
but at least it attempts
to build suspense through idea rather than clich ,
unfortunately rather unsuccessfully .
it eeds confusion much more often than cohesion ,
as the story becomes jumbled 
messy and incoherent near key point of the mystery
( predictable
as it is .
) horror fan
who pick up a copy will
have no idea
they are in for a film
that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality
than delivering a body count .
credit goes to carpenter
for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick ;
too bad he is created a derivative psychological thriller .
sagemiller also deserves kudo for showing strength in the central performance ,
actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling cassie .
it is great the filmmaker try something different ,
but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment.4/10
