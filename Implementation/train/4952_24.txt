this adaptation positively butchers a classic
which is beloved for its subtlety .
timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuance of rochester 's character .
i get the feeling
he never even read the book ,
just sauntered on set in his too tight eeches
and was handed a character summary
that read `` grumpy 
oody 
murky past . ''
he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person
but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile
until
after he gets engaged at which point
he miraculously morphs into a pansy .
there is no chemistry .
the only feeling
that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity
and also sympathy for charlotte bronte
who is most definitely turning in her grave .
go and reread the book .
rochester has a personality .
and by the way :
a `` passionate '' love scene does not mean you have to eat her face .
