typical formula action film :
a good cop gets entangled in a mess of crooked cop and japanese gangsters.the okay result
has decent performance 
a few fleeting snicker-inducing moment 
and some fair action sequence
-- plus a chance
to check out the gorgeous danielle harris --
who makes the most of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teen daughter .
** out of **** .
