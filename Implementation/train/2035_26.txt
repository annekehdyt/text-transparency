without question 
the worst film i have seen for a long while .
i endured to the end
because surely there must be something here 
but no .
the plot ,
when not dealing in clich\u00e9s ,
rambles to the point of non-existence ;
dialogue
that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed ;
character never develop beyond sketch ;
set-piece are clich\u00e9d .
worse ,
considering its co-director ,
the photography is only so-so.comment elsewhere
that elevate this alongside get carter 
long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark ;
life of the saint lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading .
in short 
their craft .
a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30-minute short ,
but as it stands
it is a 6th form film project realised on a million-pound scale ; rambling and bloated with its own pretension .
that it received funding
( surely only because of rankin 's name )
while other small film struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry .
