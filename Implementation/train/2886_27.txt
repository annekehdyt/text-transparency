after reading the comment to this movie
and seeing the mixed review ,
i decided
that i would add my ten cent worth
to say
i thought the film was excellent 
not only in the visual beauty 
the writing 
music score 
acting 
and directing ,
but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road
he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way
he felt
and knew to be his path .
i am very pleased 
indeed ,
to have had a small part
in telling the story of this remarkable man .
i recommend everyone to see this
when the opportunity presents itself ,
no matter what religious path he or she may be walking ,
this only instills one with more determination
to live the life
that we should with true value of love and forgiveness
as the savior taught us
to do .
