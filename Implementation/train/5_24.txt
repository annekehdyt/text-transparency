when i was a kid
we always used to be babysat ,
and we always used
to rent a film or see a film at the cinema .
this is one of the film
we watched .
this is one of the stupidest film i
have ever seen ,
i think
it might even be a walt disney picture film !
a martian is dropped on earth ,
turns into a human 
befriends a human ,
and is trying
everything he can to get back home .
but he is distracted by the wonder of the earth .
the only good comment i can give is the choice of actor 
back to the future 's christopher lloyd as the martian 
uncle martin 
dumb and dumber 's jeff daniel as tim o'hara 
elizabeth hurley
as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie .
but apart from that it is complete crap .
poor !
