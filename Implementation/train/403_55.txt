this has to be the worst film i
have ever seen .
i bought the dvd
and it did not work ,
well the dvd worked fine 
its just the film did not ,
in fact its so bad
that i think
non of the actor have worked since
( or before judging from the acting ) .
there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror .
the production value are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scene
being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone.all in all
it was so bad a film
that a viewer could think
it was going to turn into a porno if
they did not know any better
( which have been an improvement ) .
there are only two line in the film
that are funny ,
both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute .
( although they hardly merit watching all 76 minute for )
as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated .
i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad :
he chose his weapon .
he selected his victim .
he picked his nose .
he turned into a girl !
but i thought
it might be funny .
also the case claims
it is digitally re mastered ,
i would love to have seen it beforehand ,
the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper .
the case also says
it is an absolute disgusting movie 
in what way ? 
disgusting production 
acting.this film out stay it welcome in the first five minute ,
(
if you are considering buying this i
would say
buy `bad taste '
instead it is a much better film
and is funny ,
also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it .
) incidentally
if anyone knows anything about any of the actor
( or director patrick j mathew )
and what they have done since 
please post here
as i would love to know ,
purely to find out
if there is a worse movie out there ,
or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
