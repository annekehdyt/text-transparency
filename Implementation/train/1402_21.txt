i viewed this movie in dvd format .
my copy may have been affected
but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd .
i will say
that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani .
while fun to watch ,
i feel
she did not live up to my expectation
that i have so far found from her other film .
i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance .
the other two actor i was not very familiar with so i can not compare their performance ,
however they were fairly enjoyable also .
the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion .
the story line ,
while some could say slightly compelling ,
lacked direction .
i feel
that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film .
if you enjoy any of these actor to a fair extent
then i recommend this film ,
but otherwise leave it alone .
