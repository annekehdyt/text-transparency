i think
this movie got a low rating
because it got judged
by it is worst moment .
there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene ,
but apart from that there are actually quite a few moment
that made me laugh out loud .
jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie
and julia stile manages to be pretty damn funny herself .
apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedy 
after about 40 minute into it you know
how it is going to end .
( which is better than most of them ,
where you already know after +/- 5 minute ) .
anyway 
better movie to watch but definitely not the worst pick ... cheer
