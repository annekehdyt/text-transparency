i gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance
as it is hard to praise something
that so haunted and terrified me for year .
the sheer menace on the woman in black 's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread .
i saw this
when it was first on tv
when i was 10
and it really did disturb me for year .
i am fascinated by the fact
that so many other user have said this too .
so many movie review go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be
but you can believe all those
who have posted on this board ,
this really is incredibly powerful stuff .
i mean i really like horror film
and generally find them quite funny more often than not ,
but this really is menacing
and will probably disturb most person .
i have not seen
it since i was 10 and i am tempted to watch it again
but fear i might have some sleepless night .
i can not quite put my finger on what it is exactly ,
but i think
it is something to do with the fact
that fear is the woman 's greatest weapon
and that we ,
as viewer 
are just as susceptible
as we feel the fear so intensely .
it is remarkable that other viewer ' feeling are so
unanimous.i have also seen the stage play ,
which was an excellent production ...
but nothing can compare to this .
