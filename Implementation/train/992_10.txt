i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb .
it was a neat film
and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb .
at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onward i am trying for vcd of this film
but i am unable to find it .
huge african lion makes appearance int his film
and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animal and grace of them .
all section of audience can watch this movie particularly child will enjoy this film .
but some scene involving mccomb force parental guidance for this film .
it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all .
