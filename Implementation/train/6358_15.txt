i watched the presentation of this on pbs in the u.s.
when it originally aired in 1988
( ? ) .
assuming
the miniseries was available on dvd i
purchased first edition of all three book last year .
since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie site .
today i found this web site .
i will give up the search.i too would like to buy this complete - 26
episode - miniseries .
after buying the dvds i would read each book ,
then watch the episode for that book .
that is what i did with john lecarre 's karla trilogy and larry mcmurty 's texas ranger trilogy.does anyone have any suggestion for great book or book series
that became very good tv miniseries - or movie series -
that are now available on dvd ?
