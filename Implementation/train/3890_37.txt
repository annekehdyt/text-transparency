the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense .
it does not present a series of pretty picture .
instead it is a visually interesting film .
it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shot .
this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at .
the film refuses to use the crutch of a genre
to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what is going on .
instead the film touch on
and move through a number of different genre .
the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness .
i suspect 99 % of north american viewer will just not get it .
if you try to pin down the narrative of this film 
or the philosophical message 
or the symbolist structure 
etc .
you will waste your time .
there are none of these .
the film only feints towards these genre and other at time .
the only unifying force in the film is claire denis 's own sense
of what fits together .
there are so few feature length film
that come close to satisfying kant 's description of what art is ,
namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experience under concept .
film usually takes the easy way out and opt for the simpler pleasure of understanding
what is happening .
most film is not art .
most film does not come close to art .
when a film does ,
as this one does ,
and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewer ,
it is something of a miracle .
my on negative comment is that at time i find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative thread
that run through it .
the tahiti father-son narrative ,
even though it is not exactly conventional ,
ends up making thing a little to clear and simple .
it dominates too much .
