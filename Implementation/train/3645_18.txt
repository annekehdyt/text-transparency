jane austen would definitely approve of this one !
gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma .
she is funny
without being excessively silly 
yet elegant .
she puts on a very convincing british accent
( not being british myself ,
maybe i am not the best judge ,
but she fooled me ...
she was also excellent in `` sliding door '' ...
i sometimes forget
she is american ~ ! ) .
also illiant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law
( emma thompson 's sister and mother )
as the bate woman .
they nearly steal the show ...
and ms. law does not even have any line !
highly recommended .
