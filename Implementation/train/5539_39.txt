eight simple rule started as a very entertaining series .
i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship
he had with his child
was the best part of the show.i have alway preferred kerry to bridget ,
bridget has been done before ,
kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many way ,
although i am not sure i like the direction her character
went in later series.early episode
were fun 
good simple teenage plot about paul and cate disciplining the kid ,
however i think
the show lost
it is sparkle
when john ritter died .
i admired the cast and crew for wishing
to continue the series
but
when he died ,
i felt the programme did to .
to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the '8 simple rule of dating my teenage daughter '
it was written by a real man with teenage daughter and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed
without the hennessey dad.bridget seemed to get more annoying ,
rory stayed the same and cate was alway giving her offspring life 's lesson
which before seemed funnier
when it was all left to paul .
i think
the granddad is funny
( especially when he is watching great escape )
but feel
c.j is unnecessary to the show .
he is funny in part
but i felt the story line at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series .
over all the newer one are not bad just missing excitement
and does anyone else find it irritating
that cate work at the school and c.j and granddad 's alway there too ?
i would alway recommend this show to friend
as it was very strong at the beginning
and well worth watching for paul and kerry ,
but later one were about average at best .
