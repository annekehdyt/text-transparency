the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem
we are in for a large dose of maudlin 
sickly sentiment.but ,
talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotion in the right manner ,
and it emerges instead as a compelling ,
deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances.one of the best 
if not the best tv movie of the 1990 's which possibly would 've had even greater success
if it had been released in the cinemas.the evacuation of child to countryside town and village in world war ii was of course a common practice 
but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk 's capital.the horror of war on the home front are not drifted over though 
and the construction of the film
until it is throat-lumping ,
misty-eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism
despite
what has happened before.it is almost
( but not quite )
worthy of comparison with the finale to it is a wonderful life
( 1946 )
.all in all 
a modern classic .
