the first thing i have to say
is that i own jake speed .
i have seen it at least 10 time .
this movie is one of the most fun movie ever made .
the film begins with margaret
( karen kopin )
trying to find her sister .
her sister was kidnapped in paris
and the family has heard nothing .
along comes jake speed
( wayne crawford ) ,
telling her exactly
where her sister is and making an offer to find her .
jake speed is a hero .
he does not work for money
because he just wants to help
and have a good adventure .
his partner
( dennis christopher )
follows him around
and writes their adventure into novel .
this film is a great adventure .
it is hilarious ,
it is action-packed ,
it is just great .
i guess
it is a cult film with a very small cult following .
crawford is perfect as jake speed
and throws out some one-liner
that you will never forget .
kopin and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick 
respectively .
john hurt 
the guy
who 's stomach
blew up in alien ,
plays the devilish 
pervertish villian
which just adds to the fun .
in many way 
this film is similar to indiana jone ,
in some way it is similar to james bond film .
maybe it should have been called indiana bond
but whatever it is title is ,
it is a very enjoyable film .
