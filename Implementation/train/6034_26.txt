in recent time i have been subjected to both this movie and `` king arthur '' 
on dvds
chosen by other for an evening 's `` entertainment '' and together
they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i
have
that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination ,
and is content as long
as they get `` action '' .
both movie were utter rubbish.whatever happened to character development ?
whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ?
whatever happened to acting ?
and ,
when watching something
that vaguely purports to be `` historical '' ,
whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy 
some realistic idea of the `` political map '' of the time 
even some slight flavour of the era 
especially in its social attitude .
why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america ?
i have read on the message board of disclaimer
that `` little was known '' of the dark age .
not so .
considerable amount are known 
with much learned scholarship on the era ,
but these joker simply could not be bothered to do any homework.i
only wish i could vote 0/10
