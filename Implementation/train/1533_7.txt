certainly one of the dozen or so worst movie ever released in any form ,
featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix
( river 's sister 
inevitably ) ,
as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbin 
the author of the novel ,
which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charm .
