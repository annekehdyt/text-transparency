a young scientist harry harrison is continuing his late father 's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colour 
but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum .
when he finds out ,
there is an accident
involving harry
losing an arm .
so 
he tries out the serum
and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm
that has a mind of its own.oh
we have seen this oh so many time before ,
but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icon elke sommer and oliver reed .
actually it is not a bad flick by fangoria film ;
just there are better one out there ,
which are similar in vein .
`` servered ty '' simply lacks it own distinctive style .
the oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled `` re-animator ''
and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from `` evil dead 2 '' .the comic story is truly whacked out with it is black humour ,
but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor .
surprise do crop up 
especially the flick 's final outcome .
which is well accepted ,
as i thought
it could have copped out with something more accessible .
for a low-budget production the fx makeup can look rigid and very goofy ,
but there is some grotesque moment
that will make you smile than actually cringe .
even a ush of sexual tension streamlines the story 
thank to elke sommer 's sternly juicy performance as the mother .
oliver reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense
and he pulls it off extremely well .
they were both immensely diverting
as the couple you loved to hate .
billy morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as harry .
director damon santostefano iskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scene of gripping and bamboozling horror.yeah
it is juvenile and basically silly nonsense ,
but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment .
