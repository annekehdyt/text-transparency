the fiendish plot of dr. fu manchu starring peter seller in a spoof of the character
created by sax rohmer
is an injustice to the end of seller ' career .
the plot was very simplistic ,
and if done the right way could have been handled nicely ,
but instead it was poorly executed .
part of the reason
why this film was not that good was the poor dialog 
cheap laugh 
choppy directing 
and an awkward feeling
that the film was somewhat incomplete.the acting ,
on the other hand 
was really the only thing
that kept my interest during this mixed up picture .
i found seller portrayal of diabolical manchu illiantly done 
with the occasional line
that will be remembered .
for example 
there is the scene
where fu manchu is confused
which henchman is which
in which he says `` ah ,
you all look the same to me . ''
i hate to admit it ,
but i laughed out loud with that line.then of course a fistful of strong supporting character really caught my attention with the like of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable 
david tomilson as sir roger avery
( his last film as well 
not a way
to end a career ) ,
and sid ceasar
( who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone 's relative
who works for the fbi ) .
these character also kept me
watching.the set were also nice .
oriental design and english society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture.in all honesty ,
my advice to you is to watch the film
if you are a peter seller or sid ceasar fan .
otherwise 
you are better off settling on chewing aluminum foil .
