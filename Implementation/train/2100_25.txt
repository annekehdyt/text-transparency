i was forced to watch this whole series of film
as a young child and i was told
they were real !
talk about child abuse .
i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein .
this series is only good for person
who believe in this ridiculousness
and who want to indoctrinate their child into believing the same .
besides the obvious issue
associated with ainwashing and indoctrination ,
there is also the bad acting 
bad writing ,
and bad `` special effect '' .
they are just all around terrible 
terrible movie .
yes 
believable
( and horrifying )
to a kid ,
but i can not imagine a grown-up buying into this shlock .
although 
i must say ,
that i would be interested in seeing them today 
as an adult .
they might have a certain midnight/cult movie feel to them .
