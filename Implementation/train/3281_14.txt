what a disappointment !
i hated the mummy but this one was even worse !
it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point
i found myself sighing and yawning all the time .
i can not believe that person actually liked this movie .
the role of nicholas cage was not very convincing .
the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america 's most wanted building .
the never stopping flow of hint and combination was not very convincing either .
i stopped paying attention around 30 minute .
what was supposed to be a happy night
out became a total disappointment .
what a drag ... i guess
i have just seen too many movie
to enjoy national treasure .
