i own 2 home entertainment store and i have seen a lot of bad movie in my time
but this one was so bad
it compelled me to register here
and comment on it .
how bad was it ?
let 's just say
that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii
when compared to giada colagrande 's in this movie.it
was robotic and uninspired .
her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'rubber house '
he had given her .
once there ,
she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship
but none of it seems to register with her .
within a day 
she starts a relationship with leslie ,
( dafoe )
the caretaker of the house .
even though she is married to dafoe off screen ,
her scene with him
were cold and unemotional.if there was a plot ,
i missed it .
not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur 
cinematic train wreck
that it is .
