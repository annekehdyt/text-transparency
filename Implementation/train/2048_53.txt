( spoiler in this ) '' rosenstra\u00dfe '' is a movie about heroic woman in german nazi time .
but it is way too long ,
it is not touching and sometimes even boring !
there are too many clich\u00e9
and not enough good acting.the storytelling
( storyline )
is bad .
like in jame cameron\u00b4s titanic an old woman remembers event of her live .
good 
now we\u00b4ve got a point of view .
than there is another woman introduced
who does the same .
confusing is that they both are recalling event of lifes of other person !
come on !
this is a lack of knowledge of basic story
telling ... how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl\u00b4s mother and her interrogation for example ?
the scene are shown in the wrong order
and you rarely know
when it took place .
for example the scene
when riemann is proposing to fabian .
when did that happen ?
the scene looks like
it is set in the twenty ... riemann\u00b4s character
is of course a talented pianist 
well ,
she is even a baroness !
wow .
her other comes back from the eastern front ,
he has received a `` ritterkreuz ''
which he is showing in some scene .
so he is a war hero and still a fine man
who preserved his conscience .
and he gained knowledge of massacre committed by german .
he even made some photographs !
and so it goes ,
clich\u00e9
after clich\u00e9 is piling up
and this is why
the movie does not work.basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something
what could have been a decent movie .
and in the end it\u00b4s all very simple .
riemann finds a way
to get goebbel into bed and - ta da !
- everyone is free .
which is not a historical fact
but pure imagination despite the `` true story '' claim at the beginning .
like `` sass '' it is vaguely
based on a true event.it
is sad but true 
this is the typical german movie these day .
it is bad !
