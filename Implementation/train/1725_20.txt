the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillian
who reluctantly reunite for a tv special
despite the fact
that they despise each other.the comic genius of two master at work 
george burn and walter matthau are stellar !
some of the best scene are
when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial thing !
the material is fast-paced and witty 
appealing to all ages.mild spoiler alert :
there are some mildly sad moment toward the end of the movie
that deal indirectly with the affect of aging
that gives the film a soft 
sincere ,
tenderness
that shows to this reviewer
that what the pair really need the most for success ,
are each other.if
anyone loves the odd couple ,
you will adore this movie .
an excellent film !
