if you seen rodney dangerfield 's previous movie and performance ,
you will recognise several of the joke
made in this odd piece of dreck .
written like a sitcom ,
this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout 
from the self-help doctor
played by the away sexy-as-chopped
liver molly shannon to the 'i am fat ,
and therefore funny ' john linette .
the 5 wife themselves are likeable enough ,
and
if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series ,
it might have worked .
instead 
it comes off like a male fantasy
that is trying hard not to be politically incorrect .
