although critically maligned 
johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movie
i have ever seen .
it is a movie
that should be watched closely ;
some of the funny bit are done in passing
and do not have the usual amount of attention
drawn to them .
for instance 
keep an eye on michael keaton 's use of the pricing gun at the pet store ...
and also on the documentary-style year
that appear at the beginning of scene .
it is one of those rare movie
where the humor hits you unexpectedly ,
even though you know
it is a comedy .
amy heckerling 
the director 
is really sharp here
-- if you enjoyed her better known film
( fast time at ridgemont high 
clueless 
european vacation 
etc. 
)
you should give this one a look.michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast
( griffin dunne 
maureen stapleton 
joe piscopo 
peter boyle )
is excellent .
highly recommended .
