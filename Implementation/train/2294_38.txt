i almost never comment on movie ,
but i saw the 5 glowing review of this `` movie ''
and decided i had to weigh in with my own review .
an instructor of mine received this film in the mail 
mixed in with his academy screener
( ampas 
aka the guy
who vote on the oscar ) ,
and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he ought it in to our class
to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie.this film
has no plot ,
the scene are horribly 
horribly edited
( oftentime using faux `` 24 '' style picture-in-picture technique ) ,
and the performance
( particularly the lead ,
who even fails at acting like a bad actress )
are for the most part 
obnoxious .
someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction 
namely 
the setting up of the plot .
there is no setup !
halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew
what this movie was supposed to be about .
the opening crane shot ,
which sets up some kind of murder ,
is never addressed ,
and
now that i think about it ,
was possibly meant to be a flash-forward ,
with the rest of the film
being a flashback ,
but it cuts from that scene directly to the next
without any indication as such.bah ,
i could really go on and on .
at the very least 
this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability .
