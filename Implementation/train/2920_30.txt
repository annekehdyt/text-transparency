i first saw this movie on cable about 5 year ago
and i could not stop laughing .
everything about this movie seemed to click 
the storyline 
the character 
the setting .
as far as film is concerned
i would not call this a great movie
but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic .
it gets it is meaning across .
the cast is maybe as good
as any ever put together in a comedy movie .
corben berbson 
fred gwynne 
ruben blade 
and ed o'neil are hilarious .
for this
who have not seen it ,
i will give you a ief synopsis :
four criminal meet up in a small town in montana
after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist .
however when their friend is arrested by two cop
who chased him from new jersey ,
they try to figure out what going on and all hell eaks loose .
the film is truly a great bank caper comedy
and is sort of like a poor man version of ocean eleven 
only with four criminal
who can not stand each other 
and in montana rather than las vegas .
all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie .
