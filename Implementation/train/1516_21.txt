if there was a zero rating ,
i would give it to this movie .
today was the second time i
tried to watch it
and i still could not make it through from beginning to end .
i can not believe the multiple star
given by other and can
only assume
they either know the actor or are a publicist in disguise !
the acting is atrocious all around ,
the script is blah 
the kid playing nichole show zero emotion
even when she is being threatened .
the `` southern '' accent from the actress
playing amber 's mom is laughable -
i am from georgia
and have friend from texas -
believe
me nobody talk like that !
none of her emotion seemed real in any scene .
the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
