sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world
but compared to his other 
frank ... well ,
roll out those award now !
mullet haired 
muppet frank seems to think
that every part he plays ,
call for him doing the role as an american/italian wise-guy refugee from the 'godfather . '
please 
somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse ! '
this film just stinks the place out 
even by the terrible overacting in this 
frank still steals the acting dishonours .
all the person compensate for their lack of talent
by shouting their line and throwing their arm about ,
gesticulating wildly in a style
that went out of fashion back with silent films.the plot ,
what there 
is 
makes no sense as a meteor lands
and turns all the woman into sex-crazed nymphet
but as this is 15 certificate film ,
that just means they strip to their underwear
and make moaning sound like dog on heat .
what happens in the end ,
i am not quite sure
as i was losing the will
to live long before the film finished.avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact ' for a reasonable film about a meteor
about to hit the earth.n.b .
point of order :
when one of the female leads strip down to her underwear ,
she has her knicker/panty under her suspender/garter belt ,
it is knicker over the suspender
to allow woman to go to the toilet with less fuss .
a trivial point 
perhaps 
but shows how dumb this film is
when they can not even get this right !
