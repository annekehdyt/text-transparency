i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech
they have today
it would ing back the kid excitement in me.i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero 's every week.you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure.oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoint about tv and the many movies.so any ole way
i believe
i have got what i wan na say.would be nice to read some more plus point about sea hunt.if my rhyme would be 10 line
would you let me submit ,
or leave me out
to be in doubt
and have me to quit ,
if this is so then i must go so lets do it .
