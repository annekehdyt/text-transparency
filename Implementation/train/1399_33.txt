well ... tremor i 
the original started off in 1990
and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch .
however 
they proceeded to make tremor ii and iii .
trust me 
those movie started going downhill right
after they finished the first one 
i mean 
ass blaster ? ? ?
now 
only god himself is capable of answering the question
`` why in god name would they create another one of these dumpster dife of a movie ? ''
tremor iv can not be considered a bad movie ,
in fact it can not be even considered an epitome of a bad movie ,
for it lives up to more than that .
as i attempted to sit though it 
i noticed
that my eye started to bleed ,
and i hoped profusely
that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me .
did they really think
that dressing the person
who had stared in the other movie up
as though they we are from the wild west
would make the movie
( with the exact same occurrence )
any better ?
honestly 
i would never suggest buying this movie 
i mean ,
there are cheaper way to find thing
that burn well .
