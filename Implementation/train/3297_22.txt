this film revolves as much around japanese culture
as it does the life of one modern japanese family .
physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7
( especially in public )
hence all that bowing instead of hugging
even when you are close friends/ relative .
ballroom dancing involf putting your arm
around someone else
and that in public too !
never the less ballroom dancing is ( on the quite )
immensely popular .
person
who do ballroom dancing in japan
are viewed a bit like nudist in the west ...
many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture .
a delightful family film ,
which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone .
i understand
that it was more popular than titanic in japan .
i guess
the japanese are just like the rest of us -
they like to be hugged too .
