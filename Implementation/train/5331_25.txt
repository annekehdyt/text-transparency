oh 
it is the movie -
i thought
i waited too long to take out the dog ...
i can not believe
i watched the whole thing .
i guess i was optimistically anticipating
that it was going to get better .
horribly disjointed dialog 
pathetic acting 
and totally improbable event .
like toby 's mom hanging herself in the time
it takes col to walk upstair
and back down in a room with a 24 ' ceiling and no chair 
counter or anything around her motionlessly suspended body
that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in .
the little girl
that played the daughter of the last family
was the best actor in the whole movie ,
and the puppy of the first couple was a close second .
the basic storyline has potential
and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick ,
but this version sadly is not it .
i get more scared
when i open my electric bill every month .
