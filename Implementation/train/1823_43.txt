it is rare that i feel a need
to write a review on this site ,
but this film is very deserving
because of how poorly it was created ,
and how bias its product was.i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-maker to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy .
we hear them discuss the sadness
that they feel from oppression ,
yet the film is shot
and arranged in a way
that we feel
the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population .
we see no evidence
that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager .
we only hear from other palestinian in prison .
i understand
restriction are in place ,
but the political nature of the restriction are designed
to prevent peace.i came out of the film feeling
that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning
and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence 
so to speak .
she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber 's parent ,
and her angry and closed-minded word caused the final meeting
to spiral out of control .
it is more realistic 
in my mind ,
to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ;
ignored plea for understanding and freedom ,
ignored request for acknowledgment for the process
by which the jewish population acquired the land.i
have given this a two
because of these selfish weakness of the mother ,
which normally would be admirable in a documentary 
however in the light of the lack of impartiality ,
it all seems exploitative .
also for the poor edit 
lack of background in the actual instance ,
and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side .
ultimately 
it is a poor documentary and a poor film .
i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation ,
but am obliged to note the flaw in direction
regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter .
