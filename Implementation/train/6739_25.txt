if you are the sort of person
looking for a realistic film
or one with a strong and believable plot ,
then this film is not for you .
nope
-- you will hate it .
however 
for those
who like sweet 
slightly screwball comedy ,
then you will have a nice time
watching this slight film.tony randall works for the ir
and he investigates a very nice farmer
who never realized
he needed to file an income tax return .
however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit ,
everyone in the family is thrilled to have company .
they dote on him
and treat him like one of the family 
...
and have plan on getting him hitched to their daughter 
debbie reynold .
that is really about all the plot there is .
but the film gets high mark for a fun script and decent acting .
a really nice little curio from the late 1950 .
