this is not a profound movie ;
most of the plot aspect are pretty predictable and `` tried and true ''
but it was well-acted and made some interesting point
about what we might regret
( our `` mistake '' as the movie calls them )
as we look back over our life .
i had not read the book ,
so did not know much other
than it was the story of a dying woman
who has strong memory from long ago
that she has not really shared with anyone .
thankfully they got a top-notch cast ... .merylstreep 's daughter 
mamie gummer 
plays the young lila ,
and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila ...
in addition to an amazing resemblance
( duh ! )
the younger actress did a great job
( perhaps not quite up to her mom 's caliber ,
but who is ? )
all other in this film were fine ,
although i wish
there had been more of glen close
and thought
the buddy character was alittle too dramatic .
this is more of a girl ' movie than for the guy ,
but a good one to see with your mom 
or your daughter ,
and maybe start some dialog going .
how hard it is to really know a parent as a `` person '' !
