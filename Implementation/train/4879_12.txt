for all the subtle charm this student film may contain ,
was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo
to show his paper macho face ?
? the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum
we had speed actioned to develop.do not get me wrong ,
i am all into exploring america 's dark underbelly ,
but this is a turd-a-flamb\u00e9
that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact
that p.clarkson look hot taking it.sadly ,
from a guy from wings.the best 2 minute the film has to offer.if
you felt like ripping off deliverance ,
you could do better .
