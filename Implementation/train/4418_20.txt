this is a cartoon series
where most of the action takes place in the human body
where the actor are vitamin 
viruse 
blood cell etc .
i will not try to explain it in more detail ,
you will simply have to see it for yourself :
you will not be disappointed.i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s
( with swedish voice ) .
i have talked with a few person
who were also child in the 80s
and they loved it also !
i must admit
that the education-part of the episode did not get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea
of educating child
while they have fun
is wonderful .
i have recently seen a few episode ;
there is a humour and heart
in it that is hard to find in other child program nowadays.5/5
