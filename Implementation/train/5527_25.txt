i have always enjoyed kenneth branagh 's version of the shakespeare classic ,
as he always does a very good job ,
but in this movie 
the one
who lifts the whole movie ,
is none other than `` the-always-great-actor '' laurence fishburne .
surely he has made some poor choice in film ,
even though he is a wonderful actor ,
but in this one we are truly given the real othello :
the passion 
the intensity of jealousy
as it grows stronger alongside with fishburne 's well portrayed paranoia and 
furthermore ,
we are finally given a black othello ! i do not think
they could have chosen a better othello .
who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy 
love/hatred and 
not to forget 
those fiery eye ... ?
branagh is good as always ,
but not at his peak 
ir\u00e9ne jacob 's desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak 
whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it
and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie .
do watch it .
