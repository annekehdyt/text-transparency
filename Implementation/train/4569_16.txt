a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play 
nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie .
but doing nothing else nicely at all.a under-parr performance from the actor 
law and caine ,
diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction.the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting .
the subtle interplay between oliver and caine
which made the first movie so watchable ,
is replaced with a horrid 
ash arrogance
that instantly eeds disdain in the viewer .
but this is not the clever ,
to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character
the original fostered so well ,
this is an obvious ott character
assassination of both character from the word go.this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing 
watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act .
