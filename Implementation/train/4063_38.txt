this very good movie crackle with tension .
the stake are 
of course 
high
-- will the police and widmark 
the public health doctor 
apprehend the criminal
who do not know
that they are carrying plague before a full-scale epidemic eak out ?
but smaller plot element introduce tension in every scene
-- between widmark and the police captain 
between the bad guy
played by palance and mostel 
between palance and a dying plague-stricken man
whom palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt
because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity 
between widmark and his wife 
and with the underlying question
of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation
to avoid a full-scale panic .
the movie is beautifully shot by kazan ,
in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes shot on location in new orlean ,
and ends in a stunning climax ,
where palance flee like a rat from his pursuer 
through the dock and warehouse of the city .
the commentary is superb 
probably the best
that i have heard ,
covering the cinematography 
the framing and lighting of shot 
the production design 
the casting of non-professional actor in small role 
and the irony and parallelism in the plot 
like an insightful seminar on 1950s film technique and film noir generally .
watch it once to enjoy the film on its own 
and ,
if you are interested in film-making 
a second time with the commentary on to learn .
