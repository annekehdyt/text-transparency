star trek :
hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film ,
done completely for the love of the series ,
and a must watch for fan of trek .
the production quality is extremely high for a fan film ,
although sometimes you can tell
that they are green-screenin ' it .
this does not take away from the overall experience however .
the cgi ship are fantastic ,
as well as the space battle scene ... on the negative side ,
i could tell in the earlier episode
( and even occasionally in the newer one )
that some of the actors/actress are not quite comfortable in their role ,
but once again ,
this does not take away from the overall experience of new interpretation of star trek .
the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here ,
and 
as a whole 
i would highly recommend this series to fan of the next generation and deep space 9 .
