heather graham could not play a convincing lesbian
if her life depended on it .
who do the producer of the movie think
they are ?
the absolute worst 
most unrealistic movie i have seen in as long as i can remember .
this movie is so bad
that i felt compelled to sign-up on imdb
and make sure the rating of this `` film '' drops.omg i am heather graham 
i just kissed a drunk chick ,
so
while she is passed out i am
really going to pace around my room for hour asking myself frantically
`` what have i done ? !
`` ..
jesus heather 
get over it
and grow up ...
and i would like to forward
that same sentiment to the idiot producer ...
and while i am at it ,
instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story ,
perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character
who 's mentally unstable ... like your so-called `` lesbian '' character ... after all ,
i know
the first time i had gay sex ,
when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street ...
honestly b*tch 
get a grip ... what a joke !
and please note there are many many many more flaw and appallingly stupid aspect to this lame flick ,
but i am so sick of even thinking about it anymore .
bottom line ,
if you are a smart person
you will hate this movie ,
and if you are not a smart person ,
then you will love it ...
it is as simple as that .
