i do not give a movie or a show ten very
often but this show touched a nerve in a way
no other show has .
i found the entire series on mysoju.com
and thought
the premise looked interesting
so i took a look see .
i was not disappointed in what i saw ;
i was moved .
this story stays on the tender side
as the main character move us through the scene .
sumire iwaya ,
played thoughtfully by koyuki ,
shows us human nature
as she wants to keep trouble from being shown .
no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate .
so instead she substitutes a human ,
played by an adorable matsumoto jun ,
as a pet .
this pet is like any other creature
we would consider a pet .
the difference ; he can retaliate in the same way ,
after all momo is a man ,
not a dog .
as he is treated like a pet ,
he reacts to situations
how a dog might react .
she spends time with the new boyfriend ,
momo gets jealous .
it is when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet
that the sexual tension between the two start
to become thick - momo
is a dance prodigy .
her thinking slowly change as we start to get a glance at his own thought .
matsumoto takes us from seeing a character
who is very one dimensional in the beginning ,
to two dimensional
when we see he
is a dancer 
to a three dimensional character
when we see him start to fall for his master as a man 
not as a dog .
in my opinion 
it is worth
watching this story just to see this character develop .
plus matsumoto play momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish
you had one too .
neither wants to think about the future
and how their relationship will change ,
but as momo
( the name she gives him
as one would name their new puppy )
states \u0096
we both knew this
was not going to be able to last .
watch this show with a open mind ,
it is worth it .
