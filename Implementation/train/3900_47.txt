the film 
a universal release of a protelco-mlc production 
is a boring retelling of the theory of eaking down the molecular structure of an object ,
capturing it in a cell as `` pure energy 
''
and then sending it back complete to a `` target area . ''
there is no explanation
why this is necessary 
but professor paul steiner
( played by pock-mocked actor bryant haliday 
`` devil doll '' )
thinks
it is something to dedicate his 
and his assistant ' 
pat hill
( mary peach )
and chris mitchell
( ronald allen ) ,
lives to .
during an experiment before noted dutch scientist `` lembach ''
( gordon heinz ) ,
his machine fail due to sabotage ,
so he has himself `` projected '' by his secretary 
sheila
( tracey crisp )
to seek revenge .
of course 
she screws up
and he comes out looking like a `` pork roast '' with the power to electrocute person .
with this new-found power 
he manages to zap some cockney idiot ,
a security guy named latham
( derrick de marney )
and his lab boss 
dr. blanchard
( norman woodland ) .
he also is able to eak into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber glove and a black coat 
as well .
in the end 
though 
despite hill and mitchell 's attempt
to help him 
the clown destroys his equipment and himself .
on the whole 
a completely pointless movie with no message at all .
also one of the most depressing color films
you will ever see .
