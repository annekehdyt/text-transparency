i just viewed the film two day ago ,
and i was filled with anticipation ,
being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 month there in the '80 's .
i was somewhat disappointed
that most of this group of vignette ,
while original and artistically done ,
did not capture the `` light '' and beauty of the city very well.nor enough of the romance !
we saw none of the tree-lined boulevard ... there was too much darkness ,
not only literally but figuratively .
some of the plot manipulated the viewer it seemed ,
and let him/her down `` flat
`` ( the marais sequence ,
the coiffure salesman sequence ,
to give two example ) .
the uplifting 
good one :
the mime sequence 
the cemetery 
the montmartre
( though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend ) ,
the `` cowboy '' vignette 
and the sacre coeur
-- seemed few and far between ,
and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor
as orlando bloom be in something
that would have showcased his originality more .
