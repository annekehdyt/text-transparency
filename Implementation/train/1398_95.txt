this is the fifth von trier film
i have seen .
i believe
that he is the only director
to whom i have given such a high score on all his movie .
four of them 
the element of crime 
europa ,
breaking the wave ,
and dancer in the dark ,
i have given a 10 ,
and one 
the idiot 
i have given a 9
( and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10
since i first saw it ,
although i would like to see it once more before i do ) .
he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working director .
i tend to agree with him .
i can not blame him for being arrogant
when he has made such great film .
in 50 year ,
when von trier retire 
he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from europe
( perhaps from the planet ) ,
and there will be class taught in his name .
he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time .
it is too bad
the critic are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.about europa itself ,
i will admit
that it was confusing
and that its narrative did not seem strong .
i think
that is the point .
this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare 
or the subconscious at some level .
this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film :
max von sydow 's narration .
we are hypnotized 
or von trier is hypnotized ,
and this is our/his subconscious mind .
i am inclined to lean more toward his mind 
since the degradation of europe concern me 
an american 
very little .
this framing is also clear
if you have seen the element of crime 
an even more illiant film than this
( although i am disputing
that in my mind ;
what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd 
hopefully criterion again 
with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture ;
then ,
i am fairly sure ,
this film would seem as great as any of von trier 's other film ) .
in the element of crime 
the film begins with a hypnotist ,
whom we actually see on screen this time ,
is hypnotizing fisher 
a european detective
who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish .
the first word of that film are `` fantasy is okay ,
but my job is to keep you on track . ''
and whenever fisher 
the narrator 
gets off track ,
the hypnotist does chastize him
and tells him to get back on with the story .
he even laugh
when a character is given a really silly and trite line .
something along the line of ,
`` do you understand the difference between good and evil ? ''
the hypnotist laugh and says 
`` now 
fisher 
she did not really say
that 
did she ?
`` so the key
to interpreting europa ,
almost a sequel of sort to the element of crime 
is that we are deep in our/von trier 's subconscious ,
and the symbol there are to be interpreted within ourselves
and will likely be different for everyone .
what does the train itself symbolize ?
consider it internally ,
and only then discuss it externally .
europa is a great film 
a masterpiece .
i was never bored by it ,
even though i watched it at 3 am .
the perfect time to watch 
actually 
since it works in dream logic .
