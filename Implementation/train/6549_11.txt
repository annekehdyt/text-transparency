well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war .
excellent acting
especially when german high command refuse in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser
ordered struck .
the scene of carnage are probably too intense for effete us mind
who 'd probably prefer some silly speech and senseless abstraction like 14 point or the league of nation .
real american might appreciate the story line and the action .
for all the action and intrigue 
fraulein doktor compares favo
( u )
rably to jacob 's ladder .
