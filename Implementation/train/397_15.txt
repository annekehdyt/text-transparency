monstervision was a show
i grew up with .
from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one 
the only 
joe bob briggs .
the show kept me up friday night back in my high school year ,
and provided some of the best drive-in memory to ever come outside of the drive-in.without a doubt ,
the best late night television ever .
if you did not stay up ,
you were missing out.i know john bloom and joe bob live on ,
but i want them back
where they belong ... monstervision !
question ... did anyone else sit through all 4 hour of `` the swarm '' ?
q : )
long live monstervision !
