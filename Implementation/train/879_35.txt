i was really surprised with this movie .
going in to the sneak preview ,
knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i would seen ,
i thought
it was going to be a dude
where is my car kind of crap fest .
i was expecting bad sex joke and farting and a pathetic lead character
who will get laid in the end
because that is just how movie work .
instead i got a smart ,
surprisingly original movie about a decent 
average guy
who just never had sex.ye ,
the film is chock full o ' sex joke and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple ! ,
but it is done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boy .
all the character are person
you probably know in real life 
redeemable friend
who are just trying to hook a other up and live their lives.i
went
in thinking this movie was going to be total crap ,
and i was very surprised .
yea 
it is pretty over the top
( c'mon ,
it is a movie about a 40 year old virgin !
) ,
but it is very smartly done.in the end ,
you are really pulling for this guy
to get laid ,
which says
a lot about the movie
because honestly ,
did you really care
if ashton kutcher found his car or not ?
