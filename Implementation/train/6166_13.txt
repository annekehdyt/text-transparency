over her dead body was a nice little movie.it was decent and entertaining ,
while still being pretty funny.there were a few clich\u00e9 's ,
but i found most stuff fresh.at first i did not think
it was going to be good at all ,
when it started out.if you can get past the first 20 minute though ,
the movie starts getting more interesting.this film was not burst out in laughter hilarious 
and was not oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie
that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i do not see how this movie was bad.it is rating is just a bit too low.i could have dealt with a 5.5 
but a 4.8 ? also ,
giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.it was pretty good ,
and there was nothing horrible enough
about it to give it a 1 ,
which is what most person gave it .
