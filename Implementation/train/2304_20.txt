person are being too hard on the film .
sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story
without attempting to `` review '' it.the whole thing comes together
when hackman decides not to pull the trigger
but his target still goes down .
then the fun begins
as everyone about him also `` go down '' .just think
jfk and all the person
associated in any way with his assassination ,
who 's life ended auptly and in questionable way
and you will appreciate what is implied in this film.i think
it is an excellent interpretation
of what may well have occurred .
though the exact story line my not have been followed
( hindsight here
after reading jim maar `` crossfire '' )
but it is what is implied
that is of interest.i would love to get a copy of it to view it again .
in light of what is known today ,
the domino principle is right on .
