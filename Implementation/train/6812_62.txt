as it is often the case ,
the impressive and explosive trailer of asian film add up to nothing more than lackluster story .
similar to unleashed
( which was great 
)
dog bite dog tells a story
where man are raised as ferocious savage dog
that carry out their master 's bidding .
the main character 
an emotionally undeveloped 
amoral killer
who is matched against an equally unstable polouse officer ,
are far from the common hero and villains
we often see .
in fact 
by the end 
you lose track
of who you are supposed to empathize with ,
failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the man \u0096
whether
that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message
he was trying to tell is up to you to decide.although the beginning of the film
was filled with intrigue and unpredictability 
by the half-way point
it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge .
the suspense
which was evident at first soon
disappeared
because of a grossly mismatched music score
which ought down the potentially effective story telling .
and in the end 
you were left feeling
that all
that detailed background information and introspection of the main character was somehow very unnecessary.on the plus side 
the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical
compared to us movie \u0096 so those
who are not familiar with asian film
and are tired of hollywood 's predictability should check
it out.the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film .
it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent
when it was supposed to be set on tungsten .
maybe i am the only one ,
but it strained my eyes.the movie also enjoyed playing trick on you \u0096 an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story
until it was diverted to a low budget 
low speed chase scene .
and just when you think
you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy ,
you realize
that it is not an ending at all 
but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity.throw in some grisly from-behind choke scene 
a momant of redemption unexpectedly ought back into savagery and back again the other way 
asian ' fascination with bodily fluid and a horrible music score
that did not match the film ,
and you get
the average bland asian thriller.i just do not get
why every fight scene was overlaid with clip of roaring lion i
thought
they were supposed to symbolize dog ?
ultimately 
in the end 
we are reminded about a true killer
that still lurks amongst us \u0096 tetanus.4/10
