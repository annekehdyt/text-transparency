man 
i loved this movie !
this really takes me back
to when i was a kid .
these were the day
when the teacher still showed classroom film on reel-to-real
and if you were good ,
they would rewind the movie slowly
so you could watch it play backward .
i still remember one of the opening line ... . ''
tutazema was his name ,
and he was an orphan .
he lived with his sister so and so in the village . ''
this is a great movie for kid and as enduring as the red balloon .
at the end the other indian boy in the village attach the feather to tutazema
and he becomes an eagle himself .
he gets to live the way
he always wanted to .
he gets to soar the heaven .
