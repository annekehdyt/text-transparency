get ready for it :
this is one of my favourite film of all time .
i am relatively unaware of david mamet 's
( writer and director )
other work
but after having watched this film half a dozen time
( it is always a joy to watch ) ,
i can say
without hesitation
that he is a genius .
this film is extremely well written ,
and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit 
con-artistry and back room hustle .
the feel of the film is very similar to the sting
( 1973 )
and it also pays homage to film noir.it is quite a psychologically complex film
and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twist and motive of the shady character .
it is slightly predictable at time
but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch.generally ,
the acting is superb- especially joe mantegna- but someone
who i watched the film with remarked
to me
that it is not a good idea
to have a heroine
( lindsay crouse )
who is not only a gambler 
a smoker and a thief
but also sport a bad 80 's hairdo .
i agree ,
but i think
she is nevertheless outstanding in the role.the less you know about the plot of this film ,
the better 
just like mamet 's most recent film 
the spanish prisoner ,
because the ending will be even more impressive .
just sit back
and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie
that comes dangerously close to illiance .
