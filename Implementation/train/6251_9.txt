i had low expectation for this movie ,
but i was looking for something unchallenging for an evening .
i walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised .
this is a very fine baseball tribute film ,
and a nice lesson
about pursuing your dream .
dennis quaid does a masterful job with his role ,
and i was touched by his performance .
definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hour of your time !
