this movie made me very angry .
i wanted desperately to throttle the `` scientist '' and unseen film-maker during the course of it .
very 
very painful to sit through .
sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way .
the little good information on ain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t.
the worst offender were the crack-pot charlatan ramtha and joseph dispenza .
mr. dispenza informs us
that most person lead life of mediocrity and clearly imply
that he 
on the other hand 
is living on a higher plane .
even the idea and attitude
that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed 
clumsy 
superior 
pretentious 
preachy manner
that i felt the desire
to disavow them .
i think
that is what made me so angry ,
the fact
that they have taken
what are indeed profound aspect of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum .
much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concept of quantum theory to the macro world .
fittingly 
the dramatized portion with marlee matlin are amateurish
and clich\u00e9 ridden.i would refer person instead to bill bryson 's excellent survey of science :
`` a brief history of nearly everything . ''
there is plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual 
established science .
