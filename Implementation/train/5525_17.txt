i was lured to see this movie by its starpower ,
but ultimately that is all it delivers .
it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption .
it is greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense .
we know
who the bad guy are from the beginning ,
and just follow along
as they fall like domino .
the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex ,
but has forgotten to substitute good 
clean romance or excitement in any other way .
all the flavor of a good 
flat decaffeinated diet cola .
`` qanda '' ,
which also takes place in new york ,
is a far better alternative ,
as is `` la confidential '' .
