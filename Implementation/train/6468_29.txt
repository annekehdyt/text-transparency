immediately after renting and watching this movie several year ago ,
a friend and i decided
that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale .
there was nothing about the movie
that could have been done worse
than it was .
to this day we still rate movie 
even very bad one ,
by how much better than `` the lonely lady ''
they are.a long time ago i saw an interview with eleanor perry ,
who wrote the screenplay for 
among other thing 
`` last summer '' and `` diary of a mad housewife 
''
and she related
that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold robbins ' book `` the lonely lady . ''
she said
that she sent in a treatment
and it was rejected
because they did not think
she understood the difficulty of a female screenwriter in hollywood .
she then said
`` i think they got someone else to write it . ''
the interview was filmed
before the movie was released .
she died in 1981 ,
and i bet the first thing
she did on arrival in heaven
was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result .
