just saw this exquisite 1982 movie return of the soldier ,
based on rebecca west 's novel .
its about a shell-shocked fortyish captain
who does not even tell his wife
he has returned to british soil ,
but remains in a hospital in london .
he is lost his memory
and is a boy again ,
with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 year earlier .
its a delicate story .
he is lingering in his boyhood ,
while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable 
aspiring socialite
who wants him to resume his place in society .
living with them is his cousin jenny ,
who loved chris baldry the soldier ,
when they were growing up as playmate ,
but has settled into spinsterhood .
the lower class woman ,
played by glenda jackson ,
is margaret gray .
it is she who is notified that chris is back in england .
chris ' wife kitty is shocked
when mrs. gray comes to tell her
that chris is in a hospital in london .
kitty
( julie christie )
is vacuous and snobbish .
why ,
she asks herself ,
was this other woman sent a telegraph about chris rather than her ?
chris has forgotten totally about kitty .
he wants to renew his relationship with margaret .
the now married margaret is reluctant to meet him ,
but then does and continues to meet with him .
there is a psychiatrist
( ian holm )
who warns kitty and jenny
that chris ' temporary happiness with margaret will disappear
if he 'cures ' him .
jenny realizes
how empty kitty is for chris
and forms a secret loving alliance through margaret .
they both are in love with him .
jenny wants to help .
late in the film kitty reveal
that chris and she had a boy
who died five year ago .
telling chris this ,
weighs the shrink 
will certainly restore him to 'normal . '
but is this a good idea ?
chris 
barely aware
that he and kitty were ever married ,
is unaware of his child and the child 's death .
the psychiatrist 
just learning of the child ,
believes
such knowledge will restore chris .
jenny and margaret have chris all to themselves
because kitty believes
he is faking and refuse to accept chris 's illness in reverting to his youth in his forty .
the film leaves her mostly out of consideration
concerning what to be done with chris.but jenny and margaret 
in the child 's perfectly maintained bedroom- with kitty too in the novel 
but not in the screenplay- discuss
what they believe
should be done about chris from their separate perspective .
margaret is the critical one here ,
because 
though married 
she has half fallen in love with chris again .
jenny 's social stature 
jenny believes 
will be threatened
if chris does not right himself .
she does not reveal this to margaret 
however .
margaret decide 
looking ahead ,
that chris can not maintain his fantasy over time ,
but must return to something like a real life .
while kitty and jenny look on from the window of the house ,
margaret approach chris outside
and tells him of his lost son .
the buoyant war victim 's head sink 
his shoulder slump 
he looks away .
he walks dejectedly toward the house .
fini read some criticism of this first novel of rebecca west .
the novel was written something after the first war .
the movie is never quite clear
who jenny is 
his cousin or his sister .
it would be more rousing
if she were his sister 
of course .
the criticism does not make it clear either .
i am sure west in her novel ,
makes sure jenny is her cousin 
not her sister .
west is no henry miller nor an anais nin ,
whose book incest
( about her relationship with her father as an adult
to get even with him for molesting her as a child )
i considered reading ,
but then decided against .
rebecca the author has a need
to restore chris too .
she too has outpost in her head for the society her novel excoriates first
but finally emaces once more .
