as far as parody film go ,
there are few
that are worth time and energy .
but with a recent resurgence of horrid parody such as date movie and the comeback 
it is a eath of fresh air
to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce
like johnny dangerously.after his mother has no end of medical problem ,
little johnny goes to work for the mob .
what fallows is a series of gag ,
most of which work ,
there are 
however 
the occasional flop .
but a foreign gangster
who can not master the american language
( profanity wise 
at least ) 
a rival gangster with a penchant
for shooting his mouth off
( ... once !
) 
a younger other with the d.a .
who is out to get johhny dangerously ,
and a hot young starlet hot for his affection have johnny busy.and
the viewer will be busy laughing 
for the most part 
as every gangster-movie clich\u00e9 is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing.not perfect by a long shot 
but definitely good for a smile on a bad day .
