note to self-
just
because a film is foreign 
obscure ,
and star catherine zeta-jone does not mean it is any good .
such is the case with 'blue juice 
' a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiast in what would seem ( to a dumb american 
anyway )
an even more unlikely place
to find surfer :
cornwall 
england .
you might be thinking
this has the making for an amusing 
quirky little comedy .
if only .
the film is just a bit over ninety minute
but it seems interminable .
the easiest way
to describe
it
is as a sort of '90 's british version of 'grease '
without the dancing ,
but even that makes it sound better
than it is .
no 
the best way
to take it
is as a little slice-of-life set in a small town .
catherine zeta-jone play chloe 
a young woman
living with a surfing instructor ,
jc
( sean pertwee ;
you remember him ) .
pertwee is actually the film 's star ,
and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotee 
the requisite oddball group of free spirit
that inevitably inhabit film like this .
in this case 
it consists of a drug dealer
who wants to be a journalist 
a former nightclub dj
who wants to be a record producer ,
and a fat nerdy guy
who 
in a needlessly extended scene 
gets stoned
and loses all his inhibition
which of course turns out to be the best thing
that ever happened to him .
i can not honestly say
everything
that goes on in 'blue juice ' is predictable ,
since it is set in a place and reflects custom and manner i am not very familiar with ,
but there is certainly nothing surprising or even interesting
that takes place there or with the character .
the comedy 
though 
is very predictable and tired .
one can sense the set-up a mile away and almost recite the dialogue
( in american form 
of course )
before the actor do .
the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed .
she wants him to grow up ;
he wants them to stay the impetuous teenager
they started out being .
he is afraid of losing face with his gang ;
she thinks
he prefers them to her .
you get the idea .
as i struggled to stay focused on 'blue juice 
' toward the end i felt ,
as the saying goes ,
that this was an hour and half of my life i
would never get back .
