other reviewer here seem to think
this is an awful film .
that is simply not true and a little unfair.the acting is of a good quality and the direction move on with a decent fluidity .
i do not think
there is anything wrong with the tarantino-esquire way of interlocking story together .
perhaps its just a new tool for director
to try .
i thought
it made the film much more interesting .
perhaps a few element of the script need tightening ,
but that is about the only fault i can find .
nestor can notillana gives a great performance as sylvio ,
also antonella rio is stunning
and worth the price of admission alone .
