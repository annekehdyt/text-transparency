this has got to be the most stupid film i
have ever seen
( spoiler ahead ) !
first of all 
the plot is stupid .
the little kid is weird
and they move to a hotel
because his father is the caretaker of it .
we find
that the kid has a gift 
the `` shining '' .
this gift never ever has anything to do with anything
except to make the kid seem cool .
then the movie gets more boring and boring until
the man finally goes crazy .
he goes on a rampage
to kill the kid and his wife
because ... well ,
he feels like it .
why else would he do it ?
all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub .
the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse ,
which is utterly disgusting .
somehow a black man enters the hotel
and is whacked with an axe .
then the kid and the woman take the black man 's vehicle and leave the father ,
who dies within minute of hypothermia .
most movie are not a complete waste of time ,
but this falls right into that category .
the music is trashy ,
the character are corny
( except jack nicholson ,
who is a good actor ) ,
the plot is twisted
and fits the description of vomit ,
the ending is very predictable ,
the storyline is slow 
tedious 
and boring .
this movie is extremely overrated .
avoid this movie at all cost .
i am surprised
it is gotten such a high rating on imdb .
