this is a thinking man 's silly movie .
if you do not expect star war and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you
as it has for my wife and i - from casting the `` voice '' of cary grant and jack nicholson as martian to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie
that you can either sleep through or watch carefully
and enjoy either way.it is not for everyone ,
but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor
that takes a quick mind
to see the joke
as it slips
by you
will enjoy this movie .
