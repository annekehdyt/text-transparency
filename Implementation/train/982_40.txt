what can i say about cruel intention 2 ?
well 
i can say in all honesty ,
i will only watch this film again
if i am fastened to a chair
and have my eye opened clockwork-orange-style.the film 'star ' robin dunne
( no ,
i never heard of him either ) ,
whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout .
in a case of terrible casting 
dunne attempt
( and fails )
to carry off playing a handsome charismatic 
charmer .
since the actor is not handsome 
nor charismatic nor charming ,
the character is left wholly unbelievable .
amy adam ,
( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) ,
tries to pick up
where sarah michelle gellar left off and ing scheming katherine to life ... however ,
adam is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion ,
often she looked like
she was reading cue card just off camera .
there were two good actor in the film however 
barry flatman
( saw 2 and saw 3 )
and mimi roger
( mrs kensington in austion power ) ,
made very good and entertaining performance as the parent of sebastian and katherine
and are the only reason
why i rated the film as a 2 
not a 1.the film itself is a poor version of the original 
with such lows as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scene
which lacked the originality of the previous film.i
think
that as a tv show 
it might have worked ,
but if it had been recasted with person
who could actually act in the main part .
