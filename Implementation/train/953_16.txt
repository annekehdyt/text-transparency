a sweet and totally charming film 
shall we dansu ?
made me laugh and cry .
at first appearance 
sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing
-- an uptight salaryman ,
seemingly devoted to his family ,
but all too easily captivated by a face in a window .
the object of his obsession is distant and cold .
but by the end of the movie 
i was in love with him 
her 
his wife and daughter 
all the dance instructor and dance student .
this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel
that i would enjoy seeing again .
