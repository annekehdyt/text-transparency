from the opening shot of the lead actor ,
we are given a early view on how so many man life are run by the woman in them ,
and the humour that comes thru with all
that goes on in the day to day of 'normal ' life.eric lartigau ,
the director picks up on how so many european man feel
that they are in complete control of their life ,
yet without the help/support of the woman
around them can not seem to make thing work .
the use of facial image throughout the film is superb ,
and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family
( mother )
is spot on.while
there are more than enough laugh in the movie ,
it still deals with single parents/adoption and the strength of family in society .
truly rewarding to watch ,
and again one
that only the french seam capable to make.so far one of the best 50
or so films i have seen this year ,
and well worth a five start rating .
i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection
when it is released
and highly recommand it to all age .
