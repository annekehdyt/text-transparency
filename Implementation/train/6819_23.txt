fall into the film category of `` way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departmant
to be taken seriously '' .
wherea shriek
if you know
what i did last friday the thirteenth or my boyfriend 's back know
they are bad ,
scarecrow does not .
evil dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre ,
that scarecrow is simply out of place .
suspicion of inexperience are immediately at play
as there are no hint of noise or viation in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane .
the repeated display of a picture of 3 man just scream for a story arc ,
but nothing comes .
although the man are obviously the scarecrow ,
there is no explanation.knowing this film is too serious
for it is own good may produce some grin .
i do not recall if joe bob brigg ever previewed scarecrow ,
but i believe
that he would not stoop this low .
however 
with an imdb rating of over 6 
there are many person
that disagree .
