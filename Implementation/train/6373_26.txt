how can you take her hard-living ,
glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent ?
it is absurd .
apart from that 
the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky ,
the plot is a shallow 
boring 
confused gangster-movie rehash
and the acting is unconvincing .
the film introduces new character all the way
throughout the film
and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence -
seemingly just to keep you nice and confused .
the film ever shows you thing
that do not really happen
and then later says
`` that did not really happen ,
this happened '' - see the ( apparent )
killing of the ( fake )
'first lady ' .
what have we seen the first 
wrong 
sequence of event for then ? terrible choice in casting 
a convoluted 
messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style .
1/5 .
