it is interesting that all
who ( so far )
seemed to like this film
had no expectation
-- i guess
that is the trick .
in contrast with them 
i had optimistic expectation ,
and that was a mistake .
as soon as i saw how close to the faces
the camera always was ,
i knew
we were in the hand of an extremely amateur director
-- that is always a clear sign of them ,
they think
it is arty or effective or intense
to hold the camera about two inch away from the actor .
the actor in this film 
though 
had only one facial expression each .
if the close camera was not enough ,
the lack of light in the film killed it .
the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark .
so now we know
that the cinematographer was a rank amateur 
as well .
`` ooh ooh 
we are going to light the set with a flashlight !
that will make it all seem intimate ! ''
no ,
that made it all seem invisible.on top of the serious technical flaw ,
there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea
that was never developed ,
and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated .
( perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany ,
but in los angele ,
forget about it .
)
the fact
that this film won a couple of film festival award
does not indicate the quality of the film ,
but besmirches the quality of these particular festival .
i can assure you
that this film will not win anything in the festival
where i saw it .
in fact 
two time during the film it seemed
that it was finally over
and person started to get up to leave
( this was one of the side effect of the cinematographer 's `` total darkness '' technique ) .
but when the film shuddered on 
instead 
there were moan coming from the audience .
and once the movie finally did end ,
it was clear that it had not mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier point .
an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scene of domesticity
( folding sheet 
cutting vegetable ,
spreading honey on ead ) .
yeah 
we get it ,
the life of the lonely old man was boring
-- but we figured
that one out at the very beginning.i recommend
that audiences miss this one ,
it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goer .
