ok 
plain and simple ,
if you are a fan of the other tomb raider game
( yes 
even aod )
keep away from legend.it is ,
without doubt 
the most disappointing tr game yet .
it looks very nice ,
it sounds very nice ,
but it is totally unplayable and i have given up .
i feel
like i have been robbed by eidos.it is very simple .
tr was a pc game
before anything else .
you control lara using the keyboard .
in 6 tomb raider game
the control were standard .
in aod they were 'tacky ' ,
but still the same general control sequence .
in legend they have changed her movement and control method
completely and she is totally uncontrollable.i have seen comment elsewhere from person
who say 'use the mouse ' .
no 
why should i ?
other say
'use a gamepad ' .
no 
why should i ?
other say
'but this has been the standard for 3rd person control for year ' well 
i do not care ,
it is not the standard for any other tr game
so why mess with it .
oh 
i know ,
because they could not care less about their original 
loyal fan base ,
they want to cash in on the new kid
who had not even heard of the series
until the movie came out
and make lot more money .
pathetic.my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game ,
and if you do buy it complain to eidos .
i have seen mass of other post 
mainly on the eidos forum 
from person
telling them how rubbish it is ,
perhaps they will listen .
