i really can not think of anything good
to say about this film ... not a single thing .
the script is a nightmare.. the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological trait
and does not seem to understand the difference .
you would think
they would at least get a technical advisor .
the performance were bad by most of the cast ...
although i do not really blame them.. the material really stink .
the editing was equally bad.. i will just stop now.. its all bad 2/10
