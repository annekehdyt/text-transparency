as the front cover says
`` the hamlet of our time 
for our time '' .i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly
after watching keneth branagh 's version
and it was truly a disappointing experience.this version takes a different approach to several aspect of the play
including sexuality ;
one very very homosexual osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia .
i think for the time
( 60 's )
this was a very well done version of hamlet
but can not compare to branagh 's complete version.just a note ... i
found the video at my local video store
( in australia )
and i am actually looking for a keneth branagh dvd
to buy
if such a thing even exists .
if anyone knows of one please tell me .
