i saw this movie with my friend
and we could not stop laughing !
i mean there was nothing scary about this movie !
it was funny all the line freddy said
were hilarious !
i think
they shoudl n't have even made a new nightmare
and just gone to freddy vs. jason .
although some part were gross
( like the head blowing up ) .
and any elm street film from 1- 5 sucked .
this was the best
besides number 1. i would not recomend this movie
if you want a good horror .
but if you have nothing else to do rent this
and you will laugh alot.i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think
it would be scary .
freddy 's dead the final nightmare overall grade :
b-
