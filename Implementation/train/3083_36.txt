one of cary grant 's most enduring comedy is mr. blanding builds his dream house .
although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today .
still cary was making a good living in the advertising field
even though he was having a devil of a time
trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the and name of wham.what
made this film
so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii year .
returning veteran from the war were claiming their entitlement under the gi bill of right
which included home loan .
the problem was there
literally were not enough house
to satisfy the demand .
around the time
the book by eric hodgin and the film were so popular congress passed
and president truman signed the taft-ellender- wagner housing law
which put the government for the first time in the home building business.i had an uncle and aunt
who were around the same time building their own home
which they moved into in the early fifty .
like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughter
and were looking to get out of inner city rochester .
their place was not quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen room ,
still they lived there the rest of their life the way cary and myrna most likely did.of course it was expensive
and the cost just keep adding up and up ,
threatening to send cary to the cleaner .
cary and myrna also have melvyn dougla around to offer counsel 
usually too late .
truth be told
he is kind of sweet on myrna and cary know
it.myrna loy 's role is simply an extension of nora charle .
if you can imagine the charle 's moving to the country and william powell
having the headach cary grant does ,
the film would still work just fine.mr .
blanding builds his dream house still works well as comedy
because the situation are universal .
and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate
who lived in their dream house together for over 40 year .
