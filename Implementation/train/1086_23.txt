how can anybody say
that this movie is a comedy ? ?
if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep
and asked for my money back .
i love gwen paltrow ,
but it was like she was on the wrong set .
i like most chick flick ,
but i hated this one .
this is the only time i saw so much clevage
and was not turned on .
those outfit were way overdone .
no one talks
that way anymore and i do not think
they even did then .
the dancing part was horrible.my ex said
to me later ... '' did not ya like that part ?
did not ya think
it was sensous ? ''
i said
yes only to spare her feeling .
now i know
why we never married.this is one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
