and is roaming freely around kabul 
operating on wounded nato soldier .
on a particularly difficult mission 
he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoot osama bin laden from a distance of about 3000 yard .
he is then finally promoted to sergeant ,
but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career ,
so he quits from the army altogether .
one year later ,
frustrated with civilian life ,
he joins the navy
and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform .
