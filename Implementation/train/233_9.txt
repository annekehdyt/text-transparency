an uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle
which dominated the horror genre in the 1980 's .
this was filmed as prank but released as the dorm

which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology the house
that dripped blood .
daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast
and this was her first horror movie
( she has also appeared in the initiation and the fly ii ) .
