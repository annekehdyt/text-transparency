the finnish version of robert altman 's `` short cut '' 
set in the small rural town of \u00e4\u00e4nekoski .
the episode present a kaleidoscope of the eternal event 
problem and emotion of human life :
joy and love 
deception and disillusionment 
hopelessness and death .
i was particularly impressed by two episode .
the first is the story of the young waitress ,
who tries to stir up a romance for his co-worker :
she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life .
the other episode present and old man dying in a hospital and his wife
trying to help him die with dignity .
particularly striking is the way
the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practice of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the `` routine '' of the hospital crew
( despite the sign of occasional empathy ) .
compared with altman 's classic ,
this movie is perhaps less professional ,
but it is definitely a great piece of art .
