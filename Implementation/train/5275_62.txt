( some possible spoiler )
i am not too sure
what dreamwork was thinking
when they decided to plunk $ 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick .
they probably thought
the spectacular animation would be more than enough to ing audience
( mostly family )
to see it in drove .
well it seemed to work for the opening weekend ,
it made $ 26 mil. 
roughly
and has made $ 38.1 mil .
total
( an estimation for this weekend ) .
but i think audience
that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did ,
when i saw
and they spread the word .
this is one majorly lame movie ,
apart from the animation everything else ,
mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old .
the movie is only about 80 min .
long ,
but it feels like a three hour epic .
a few sticking point for me are ,
well the irritating narration is one of them ,
and it is so obviously written .
at one point he escapes from some captor
and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared 
up pops the narrator
( the voice of the talented matt damon )
to clear up any misconception
( which would only happen in the simplest of mindset .
another one is the constant pop up of bryan adam song ,
now i am a fan of his music ,
i think
he is good ,
but come on did dreamwork really think
audience would be able to handle 8-9 of his song throughout such a short movie ,
i certainly could not .
finally and here is a spoiler ,
a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary 
no less ,
she
( the horse )
then falls into a raging river 
spirit
( the focus of the movie )
tries to save her ,
but they both go over a waterfall
that must have at least a 50 foot drop ,
well later in the movie near the end we see
that this horse is alive and well .
now i know this is a kid movie ,
but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable .
to sum up 
this is a really lame movie ,
i am not saying
kid will not enjoy it ,
but anyone else will be checking their watch just waiting for this tripe to end .
definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year .
-** out of 4 star .
