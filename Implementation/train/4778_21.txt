this show is painful to watch ...
it is obvious
that the creator had no clue what to do with this show ,
from the ever changing `` job '' 
boyfriends 
and cast .
it appears that they wanted to cast amanda byne in something ...
but had no idea what ,
and came up with this crappy show .
they cast her as a teen ,
surrounded by twenty and thirty something ,
and put her in mostly adult situation at repeatedly failed attempt at comedy .
soon 
they realize
that she needs a `` clique '' and cast person in their late 20s
to try to pass
as teenagers.how this show survived 4 season is beyond me .
somehow 
abc has now decided
that it is a `` family '' show ,
and thrown it into it is afternoon lineup on abc family .
