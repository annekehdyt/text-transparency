saw this in preview- great movie- wonderful characterizations- witty and intelligent dialog- actor were fantastic- peter falk will be up for an oscar- paul reiser was charming- photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater
when we saw the film ,
and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film-
it had been a long dream of his
to write a semi-autobiographical account of relationship between son and father ,
and more specifically between him and his father- this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion-
the supporting cast was well chosen
and gave the film a feeling of family- i recommend this film to anyone
who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performance
