this movie was just plain bad .
just about every cop movie clich\u00e9 is present
and accounted for .
bad guy gets away ?
check .
partner ?
check .
wacky personality clash with partner ?
check .
rookie with something to prove ?
check .
rookie shows up grizzled veteran .
check .
about the only one
it did not touch on
were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony
but i guess they are saving those old chestnut for dooley 's next outing .
add in the battle of the sex with girl power along with tired old sight gag and banal overdone material
like dooley 's prize car getting trashed all the time
and you have the recipe for one really bad movie .
avoid this one at all cost .
