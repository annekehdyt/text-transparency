this is probably the most boring ,
worse and useless film i have seen last year .
the plot
that was meant to have some philosophical aspect
emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix 
with plenty of clich\u00e9s :
the lone wolf cop 
good looking 
psychologically disturbed ,
sleeping with his gun ... + nice hard worker and shy ,
but good looking she-scientist 
you add a 2 cent plot
and you have i 
robot !
i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of and like fedex 
audi 
converse etc .
this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot
that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec .
i would not recommend this to my worse enemy ,
if you have some spare time ,
watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book .
