this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery .
it fails badly at both .
the only mystery here is why
would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie .
the only comedy is the laugh i got
when i saw
how high the reader here ranked it .
could there be two movie with the same name ?
the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eye and a plot
that was not there .
