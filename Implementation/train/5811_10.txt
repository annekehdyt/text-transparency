the supernatural 
vengeful police officer is back for a third installment ,
this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop .
standard stalk and slash picture 
yet well acted and directed ,
thus making it oddly interesting and watchable ,
though the violence is not for the squeamish
( especially the director 's cut
which was originally given an `` nc-17 '' rating ) .
*1/2 out of ****
