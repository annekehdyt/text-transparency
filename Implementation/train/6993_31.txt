why is this show so popular ?
it is beyond me why person like it .
i think
it is one of the worst sitcom out there .
because it is so popular ,
i have tried more than once to watch it
and i can not make it through an entire episode.for one thing ,
the acting is horrible .
everybody is overacting to the point
where it is annoying to watch .
they talk in unnatural voice ,
use unnatural tone ,
and have unnatural body language .
i have seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.for another thing ,
it is not funny .
the plot are dull .
they are not creative 
intelligent 
or funny .
should not a sitcom be funny ? ?
why am i not laughing ? lastly ,
what is seventy about this ?
it is about as authentic to the seventy as `` happy day '' was to the fifties.oh
and what is up with ashton kutcher ?
who cast this untalented dweeb ?
and now he is making movie ? ?
oh 
save us all !
if person think
this is quality television ,
it worries me .
