uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation ,
in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt ,
and cash strapped appearance by the ghost fail to round up any sense of awe or magic ;
edward woodward 
as the ghost of christmas present 
wobbles around on stilt
and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbin .
as scrooge 
george c. scott is too wry ,
and he never seems to truly believe in it ,
which robs his performance of its effect .
the scene
in which he is shown his past have as much impact
as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album .
no one else seems to be putting any effort in 
except frank finlay ,
who chronically overacts .
