this is an ok film
but lacks any real depth
either emotionally or in term of story telling.the story
is based on real event and this limits the amount of action to virtually none ,
also no real suspense.washington is believable in the lead
but he is sleep walking through it ,
there is no scope
to flex any acting muscle for him or the supporting cast.the story simply falls a little flat 
even having never heard of the title character
the ending was obvious
but unlike other film about such injustice this one has no emotional impact ,
you do not really care about him and the motivation of those on the outside helping seem more academic
than concerned for his welfare.there is an attempt
to inject some emotion
using the boy outside
who hero worship carter
but this seems forced.it is an ok film but instantly forgettable .
