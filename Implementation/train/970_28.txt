well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame .
however as soon as the film started the laugh started erupting from my belly .
from the subtle gesture towards a joke 
to the blatant toilet humour throughout 
along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo .
this film could ruin event
he sternest man poker face 
let alone his poker underwear .
some of the funniest blink and you will miss
it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood ,
along with constant critique of themselves
thrown into the bargain.i
just goes to show
that not only is trey parker adept at writing
he is not too shabby at the old acting game either .
i was surprised with the amount
that i was absorbed in this film .
however i am quite worried
that it is not available to buy over the internet 
here in the uk .
sort it out boys ! i am ,
and will continue to show it to all my friend annoyingly pointing out the funny bit 
and occasionally snorting into my lager .
all in all an excellent film
if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy .
however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude thing steer well clear !
however i am sure
the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudice .
