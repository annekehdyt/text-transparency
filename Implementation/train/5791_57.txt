first ,
before reading further ,
you must understand
that i am not neo-nazi ,
i am just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again.i have seen this series
and found it awful .
i mean 
ok 
it is interesting to look ,
but is it real ?
i searched for answer
and found one :
absolutely not .
first 
hitler was not angry all his life ,
the series shows an angry hitler ,
even when he is a child .
second 
hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter 
in fact ,
it is highly probable that hitler 
in reality 
was gay and fought all his life
to choke this secret .
third 
person will hate me
but it is true :
hitler was charming .
how do you think
he managed to get to power
if he was so hateful and ugly ?
because he was charming .
that is a common point i found in the interview of person
who live near or far of him
( of course 
not jew )
.this series was awful
because if you think
that hitler was just an angry bastard 
ugly 
and of course 
not charming at all ,
you are wrong .
if you think that ,
you will let person like him take power in country
and you do not want that .
if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power ,
and stop thinking
he was just awful ,
you will be able to find dangerous politician like him
( of course ,
remember he was elected )
and stop theme
before it is too late.life is important to protect ,
this series is just awful to show us the truth ,
if we continue to see hitler like that ,
another one will take place exactly as the first did .
