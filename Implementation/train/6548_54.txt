this 
for lack of a better term 
movie is lousy .
where do i start ... ...
cinemaphotography - this was 
perhaps ,
the worst i have seen this year .
it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man .
maybe they only had one camera .
it gives you the sensation
of being a volleyball.there
are a bunch of scene 
haphazardly ,
thrown in with no continuity at all .
when they did the 'split screen ' ,
it was absurd .
everything was squished flat ,
it looked ridiculous.the color tone were way off .
these person need to learn how to balance a camera .
this 'movie ' is poorly made 
and poorly done.the plot - you got to be kidding .
if i was an ss agent ,
i would sue the producer .
looked like the mark brother with radio and gun .
sutherland was in his '24 ' mode
- i can see this for free .
eva longoria would have been better with a little less on 
and a lot more showing .
as an action bimbo
she was not much.i
could not see a real plot 
other than dougla boinking the preident wife .
never did say
why the mercenary were trying to kill the pre .
i just do not see the preident of the united state running for his life in the utility tunnel of a building 
like a rat in a maze .
p-l-e-a-s-e.hollywood is dead .
this movie is the proof .
i like 'the big screen ' .
have since i was a kid .
many more 'movie ' like this and i will quit going .
what the matter hollywood 
made so many chick flick ,
forget how to make a real movie ?
if i owned a theater ,
i would start running the old movie .
the one with real actor 
good story line - and good cinemaphotography.this 'movie ' is a dog .
do not waste your time or money on it .
i rate this 'movie ' a zero !
dougla is not suited for this role .
i can over look his age ,
but his just is to much of a wimp
to carry this off .
