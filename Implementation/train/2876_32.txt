ettore scola is one of the most important italian director .
my parent and i watched together `` c'eravamo tanto amati '' on a summer night :
we liked it ,
but we did not love it
as we loved `` a special day '' .
i believe
ettore scola is pretty underrated :
we often forget to remember him ,
maybe
because his latest film were disappointing .
and so 
yesterday night 
my mum and i sat on our sofa
to enjoy this masterpiece .
writing 
direction 
cinematography 
score and production design were sober and accurate ,
but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni .
they are both excellent actor
and play the main role of antonietta and gaiele .
antonietta is an housewife :
married with a fanatic fascist ,
she has six child
but her husband wants to have another child
to get a prize for the huge family .
gaiele is simply an anti-fascist .
they spend together a special day ,
that special day of 1938
when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini .
i do not want to spoil anymore about the plot :
go looking for this film !
