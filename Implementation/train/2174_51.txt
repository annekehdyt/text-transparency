after reading the book ,
which had a lot of meaning for me ,
the movie did not give me any of the feeling
which the book conveyed .
this makes me wonder
if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.either
that or he is simply bad .
most importantly where is the lightness ? !
from the very first scene 
music drowne out most of the dialogue and feeling ,
and this continues right through the movie .
i think
the maker thought
that
by having upbeat music
playing right through the movie ,
this would make the story feel light-
however they have completely failed here .
instead the music manages
to give everything
that 'movie feel ' ,
in a way dramatising event so
that we linger on them ,
so that everything actually feels
heavy.another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line
making it more dramatic .
in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street ,
who is on his way to see sabina .
the introduction of this chance meeting/passing ,
which
im sure did not happen in the book ,
gives tomas ' story more significance
than it does make it light.there are many other example
where the continuity of the story has been changed ,
imo for the worst 
however this might have been done
because the book simply does not convert well into a movie ,
such is kundera 's style .
this makes we wonder
if all the generous reviewer on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film .
a film
which is as long
as it
is uncompelling .
for those
who have not read the book yet i
recommend just reading that .
for those
who have ,
i have to say
you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warning .
