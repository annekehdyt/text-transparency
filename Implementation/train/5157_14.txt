i watched this last night
after not having seen it for several year .
it really is a fun little film ,
with a bunch of faces you did
not know were in it .
arkin shine as always .
check it out ;
you will not be dissappointed .
by the way 
it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging ,
it is widescreen .
the transfer is rather poor ,
but at least the whole movie is visible .
