kol 
space prisoner on space death row 
manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the wood of america
where he ,
along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator '' a female cyborg killing machine .
made one year
after the best movie of fred olen ray 's career 
`` hollywood chainsaw hooker '' 
this one can not help but feel like a bit of a letdown .
just as low-budget as that earlier film ,
but not nearly as fun as i had with it .
none of the actor really stood out at me .
the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon ,
but that is pretty much all it is good for.my grade :
d+
where i saw it :
showtime thriller
