if 1977 's `` exorcist ii :
the heretic '' did him no favor ,
it is hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrill .
you have seen it all
before :
burton play a writer
who discovered at an early age
he possesses the power
to move inanimate object through force of his mind
( and you thought `` carrie '' had no impact on hollywood ! ) .
though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway ,
`` medusa '' play like recycled good ,
though the special effect in the cathedral finale are solid
( if typical ) .
lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor ,
but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak .
burton is hammy but weary ... not even telekinesis could save him at this point .
