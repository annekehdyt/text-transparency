there are no spoiler here ...
because there is no plot to spoil .
madchen amick is living proof
a face can make a living acting
-- no talent required .
the only ight spot are a few really good one-liner
delivered very nicely by alice krige ,
but then again ,
she is alice krige .
her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creature can be .
she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot .
how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery .
the screenplay writer must have been medicated
when they submitted this script .
it has major continuity problem 
superficial stereotypical character 
horror formula writing ,
and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever .
the creature ,
while they have neat skill like going `` dim '' ,
the question of where
they come from
and what they are is never so much explored .
do not waste any time on this one .
