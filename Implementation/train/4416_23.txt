i really liked tom barman 's awtwb .
you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it
while it lasts ,
and do not expect anything .
it is like sitting on a caf\u00e9-terrace with a beer 
in the summer sun ,
and watching the person go by .
it definitely will not keep you pondering afterward ,
that is true ,
but that is not a prerequisite for a good film .
it is just the experience during the movie
that is great.i felt
there were a few strand
that could have been worked out a little more ,
but being a lynch fan i do not care that much anymore : )
and i *loved* the style 
or flair of this movie .
it is slick 
but fresh ,
and the soundtrack is a beauty .
any music-lover will get his kick out of awtwb ,
i can assure you.i will give it 8 out 10 .
( music-wise 10/10 )
