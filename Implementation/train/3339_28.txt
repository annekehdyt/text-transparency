i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago .
first 
i am going to say that it looks great .
cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer .
i just wish
the movie had been as good
as it looks .
i would not call this a horror movie .
putting in a few shot of a decaying ghost
does not make it a horror movie .
there is no mystery ,
there is no suspense ,
you know
who did it the entire time .
it is a drama .
you know
what is going on with both side the entire movie .
the acting was okay 
i guess ,
but nothing special.and the tagline ,
`` revenge can be deadly '' ... .really ? ... they should have check
how many hundred of horror/thriller movie have that exact same tagline ?
it pains me to say some of this ,
but i know a lot of the person
who worked on this movie ,
and i know
they do not want person blowing smoke up their ass ,
so i give my honest opinion .
