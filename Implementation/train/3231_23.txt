first 
ifc run town and country 
and now this .
the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip-off is that town and country was watchable .
this is not.i can only surmise
that the cast signed up for this so
they could goof off in europe on somebody else 's dime .
belushi is especially irritating .
his scene with candy
( doing a z-grade dom deluise )
was torture .
speaking of torture 
five minute of the talentless shepherd ,
and i bet
the prisoner at gitmo would crack like walnut !
the real `` crime ''
( besides this being green-lighted )
is shepherd 's character :
a mousy wife
who takes a monte carlo casino for a half-million bucks !
if you buy that ,
i have some oceanfront property in arizona
you might be interested in !
