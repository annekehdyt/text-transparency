this is an old fashioned ,
wonderfully fun child 's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever .
unlike many modern story
which seem to revel in dark witchcraft ,
this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus
that is cute 
light hearted ,
and charming.the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye ,
where three cockney child 
charlie 
carrie 
and paul rollin 
are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raid .
they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price ,
who is studying by correspondence course
to become an apprentice witch .
eglantine and the trio of child use a magic bed knob
in order to travel to london on their flying bed .
here they encounter emilius browne 
the fraudulent headmaster of miss price 's witchcraft training correspondence school .
miss price set about working on spell
designed to ing inanimate object to life .
meanwhile 
they must also deal with a shady character
called the bookman and his associate ,
swinburne.angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training 
miss price .
david tomlinson plays mr. browne 
headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school ,
who has now turned street magician .
this actor was previously cast as the child 's father in the movie mary poppin .
in fact 
this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppin 
both wonderful fantasy story for child .
perhaps this movie does not have quite such memorable music as chim-chim-cheree ,
but it does boast some appealing little tune .
some have been critical ,
but the movie features excellent special effect .
all in all 
the story is enchanting family entertainment .
it is a pity
if modern child are too sophisticated for this lovely and bewitching tale ,
which should appeal to the child in all of us .
