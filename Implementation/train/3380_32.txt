i am afraid
that you will find
that the huge majority of person
who rate this movie as a 10
are highly christian .
i am not .
if you are looking for a christian movie ,
i recommend this film .
if you are looking for a good general movie ,
i am afraid
you will need to go elsewhere.i
was annoyed by the character 
and their illogical behaviour .
the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality
without teaching
that it was jesus
who is the basis of morality
is itself wrong .
one scene shows the main character
telling a boy
that it is wrong to steal ,
and then the character goes on to say
that it was jesus
who taught us this .
i find that offensive :
are we to believe
that `` thou shalt not steal '' came from jesus ?
i suppose he wrote the ten commandment ?
and stealing was acceptable before that ?
i rented the movie from netflix .
i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comment .
oh well .
