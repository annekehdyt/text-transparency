'home alone 3 ' is the first of the home alone movie
not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villain .
however 
the plot is very similar to the original 'home alone ' film .
instead of two comical villain ,
we get three or four of them .
this film involves some trap ,
but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car .
the slapstick humour is consistent as well ,
but the young boy and the villain really fail to make an impact in this film .
( no pun intended . )
this film offers nothing new or different than the previous film did ,
and there really is not the warm 
holiday feeling or subplot
that the other two film had .
it is more of a pure comedy ,
but it did not succeed
in making me laugh
as the character really did not do it for me .
i would not recommend this film ;
it is pretty boring .
if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy ,
then watch the original 'home alone ' movie .
