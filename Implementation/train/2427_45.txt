when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood ,
go watch this film .
it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting ,
and it is very encouraging ,
in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective.when you know both the turkish language
and either the danish or the german language ,
go watch the film in any case .
half of the dialog is danish in the original 
synchronized to german in the translated version 
the other half turkish 
subtitled in danish or german 
respectively .
when i watched it in mannheim 
germany ,
the reaction of the turkish-speaking audience proved
that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog ,
which 
deplorably 
mostly escaped me ,
being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitle .
still 
the film is interesting
even if you lack knowledge of the turkish.esthetically ,
the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness .
on first sight 
there is lot of corporeal movement fast as lightning ,
making it a quick 
an agitated film .
in particular ,
even though this is a kung fu movie ,
watch out for the running scene 
beautifully expressing a wealth of emotion .
but there are quite a few very slow ,
emotionally intense scene 
too .
and above all 
the character develop at a much slower pace
than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age ;
still 
there is some movement in the character to :
closely watch the villain omar ,
whose part and acting i liked very much.the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity -
shown at once 
in the same character 
at the same time .
