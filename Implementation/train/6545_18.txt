i gave timecop a perfect 10 ,
i gave this 1it is story is very boring ,
and it has only little to do with the original timecop .
lot of thing from timecop was scrapped ,
and they put in new stupid stuff instead .
this story is taking place in 2060
( if i remember correctly ) ,
but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :
confused :
and the action scene are nothing to be happy about ,
well most of them are not ... only the first one is great ...
and there are not many action scene at all ,
and they are all pretty shortat one point in the story 
the main character travel through time about 5 time within a few minute ... no wait 
make that two time ... in short :
do not waste time
watching this movie ,
it is not worth it
