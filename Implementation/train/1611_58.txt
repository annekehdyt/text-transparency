now 
i flicked onto this just out of curiosity
and had to keep watching - in the same way
that you watch a car crash ... i appreciate the fact
it is a spoof ,
but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing 
acting and dialogue .
seriously 
this rated as one of the poorest movie i have seen -
it looked more like an episode of tale from the cryptkeeper 
and a poor one at that ... okay - a few criticism
( 1 )
when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster
( we never see the monster attack him ,
so we assume its a heart attack ) ,
the army then launch shell 
rocket 
bullet at the monster -
which was foot from the doctor -
yet the doctor is not touched by any missile
and is still alive
( 2 )
the army attack from about 100 yard away ,
and we see a flame-thrower
being used - geez ,
those thing have a range of no more than 30 metre !
( 3 )
when the monster tries to take the professor 
the soldier run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling ;
the monster drops the kid ,
and the soldier do not try to shoot the monster ? ? ?
come on !
( 4 )
the monster looks like it something out of power ranger !
( 5 )
there is one scene
where the five `` good guy ''
( the priest 
the girl 
the doctor 
the reporter and the kid )
all look shocked
and we get reaction
( along the line of hand to mouth )
one after the other - so natural !
( 6 ) the general just runs away 
time after time
( 7 )
the general refuse
to try electricity
and would not listen
( 8 )
the acting is awful
( 9 )
did i mention the rubber suit monster ? ? ? ?
( 10 )
that god-awful music 
non-stop !
