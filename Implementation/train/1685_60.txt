i hope
whoever coached these loser on their accent was fired .
the only high point are a few of the supporting character ,
3 of 5 of my favourite were killed off by the end of the season
( and one of them was a cat ,
to put that into perspective )
.the whole storyline is centered around sex 
and nothing else .
sex with vampire 
gay sex with gay vampire 
gay sex with straight vampire 
sex to score vampire blood 
sex
after drinking vampire blood 
sex in front of vampire 
vampire sex 
non-vampire sex 
sex
because we are scared of vampire ,
sex
because we are mad at vampire ,
sex
because we just became a vampire ,
etc.nothing against sex ,
it would just be nice
if it were a little more subtle
with being peppered into the storyline .
perhaps have a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it .
but they did not even bother to do that ... and anna paquin is a dizzy gap-tooth bitch .
either she suck or her character suck ,
i can not figure out which.another part of the storyline
that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill
who seems to have his thing together
would be interested in someone like sookie .
she is constantly flying off the handle at him for thing
he can not control .
he leaves for two day
and she already decides
that he is `` not coming back ''
and suddenly has feeling for dog-man ?
give me a eak .
she is supposed to be a 25 year old woman 
not a 14 year old girl .
person close to her are dying all over ,
and she is got the ightest smile on her face
because she just gave away her v-card to some dude
because she can not read his mind ?
as the main character of the story 
i would 've hoped
the show would do a little more
to make her understandable
and someone to invest your interest in ,
not someone
you keep secretly
hoping gets killed off or put into a coma .
i can not find anything about her character
that i like and even the fact
that she can read mind
is impressively uninspiring
and not the least bit interesting.i will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june .
