i just bought this movie on dvd
and watched it for the first time the other night .
i have been a fan of tolkien 's work for about 4 year now ,
ever since i got out of high school .
i did not grow up on this movie ...
perhaps my mother kept me away from it .
it is definitely not for child .
not that it is bad in a graphic sense ,
but that the theme would go right over most 10 year old head .
overall 
the animation was excellent considering
this was made in 1978/1979 .
i thought
the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense .
but i am bothered
that bashki did not just add another 40 minute or so and tack on the return of the king part .
that would 've made it the ultimate movie .
i was bothered
by it is aupt end ,
and then
when i heard return of the king sucked ,
i was bothered even more .
too bad it was not one great animation film .
it might have garnered a higher vote from me .
i give it a 7. i can only hope
peter jackson will do the book justice with the new live action lotr .
