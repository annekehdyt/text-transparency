five deadly venom is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas ,
but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequence in hong kong film history .
director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece .
this movie launched the career of the five man
who play the venom .
mang lo plays yet another bad ass .
he would go on to be in super ninjas .
kuo chui
who is philip kwok
would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled .
any chop socky fan can apperciate this .
but i still think
it are not as good as super ninjas
( also made by chang cheh ) .
but all chop socky is good
and this is one of the very best .
