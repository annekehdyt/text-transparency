i saw this movie once ,
and i thought
it was ok. then my friend at work said
`` watch it again ,
it is better '' .
so i did .
and to my surprise 
it was worse on the second time !
there is a word limit ,
so i am going to get the ball rolling here.-the bombing scene were all so stupid .
why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion ? ? ?
-none of the character here are even remotely likable .
not on the first time 
not even the second.-oh 
and last time i checked 
a car does not explode from a single gun shot ,
nor can a fire
that huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher ...
did the above 3/10 viewer actually watch the movie ? ? ?
-the camera is so shaky ,
i can barely tell what is going on .
that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put ,
the rest of the movie was not much better.-the sniper scene .
the mcmanus brother
( from `` the boondock saint '' )
would roll their eye ,
it was so stupid .
first off 
why did the guy plant his gun
where one person had gotten shot ?
furthermore 
why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullet 
reloading 
aiming and not get shot ,
when there was so much chaos going on around him ?
-sas type running instead of staying and fighting back ? ? ? ? ? ?
huh ? ? ? ? ?
are the soldier ...
gay ... ? ? ?
i did not mean to sound homophobic 
but honestly ,
that scene was so ridiculous.-too long for its own good ,
yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it .
bigelow seems to think
that the more action 
the better .
look like she is wrong-
the movie is full of superfluous action scene
thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot .
i know watchman is longer at 163 minute ,
but at least that movie did not drag .
this movie 
on the other hand 
does ,
and for it 
feels longer.the only good thing was renner ,
who was satisfactory at best .
but do yourself a favour 
just skip this ,
and do not give into the hype .
