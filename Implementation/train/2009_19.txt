the author of the book 
by the same title 
should not have let her name be used for this movie .
if you have read the book ,
this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual event in the book and its spirit
that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial detail .
the movie adds nothing ,
in term of artistic merit 
to the book 's own literary achievement.for those
who have not read the book :
you will also be disappointed .
not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace ,
it does not offer anything more
while it is moving slowly
( like character development 
for example ) .
some viewer might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scene later on in the movie ,
but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in there ise and isabelle
-- its fairly tame and not imaginative at all .
