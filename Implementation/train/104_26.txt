an interesting tv movie based on true fact 
betrayed by the description of one of the leading character 
that of a prisoner .
giovanni ribisi plays his younger other ,
who has the delicate mission of deciding
if he will appeal to the court for his other 's death penalty .
but when he goes to visit him and enter elias kotea ,
the problem starts .
it has nothing to do with kotea ' acting ability .
he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian root
according to `` g.q . ''
magazine 
with a language too sophisticated for someone
who has spent most of his life behind bar .
this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend ,
whom i had not seen for almost 15 year ,
which he spent in several panamanian jail .
the young man i
used to know
is gone ,
not only because he is older ,
but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system .
there are jail
and there are jail ,
one must say ,
but this one prisoner in `` shot in the heart '' is definitely out of this world .
