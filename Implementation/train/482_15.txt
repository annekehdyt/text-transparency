i thought
this movie was stunning 
with completely outstanding performance by valentina cervi
( artemisia gentileschi )
.cervi portray artemisia so beautifully 
with tentative yet confidant mannerisms 
her hand mapping out an idea
before moving her model into place .
the passion
to which artemisia gives to her art
is just spectacular to watch.although not each character
was overtly beautiful ,
this made the film more realistic as the facial hair
and clothing was perfect for that point in time.overall i thought
this film was fantastic .
