i am working my way through the horror classic 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombie is one of the movie in the set .
i am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter ,
which makes most of these movie a laugh riot.i had high hope for revolt of the zombie ,
after watching white zombie ,
which is really the precursor to so much
that is the mainstay of zombie in cinema
( think
clive barker 's serpent and the rainbow and james bond 's live and let die funeral scene 
not night of the living dead )
.however ,
even though the title includes the word `` zombie 
''
it is little more than a love triangle ,
involving anthropologist armand louque ,
who is smitten with claire duval ;
who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson .
what a yawn-fest 
my daughter fell asleep half-way through.i had a real hard time deciphering
who these person
worked for
-- the ally or the axis ;
but 
i guess
that does not really matter.i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credit for this movie ;
but 
of course those were his eye
( from white zombie )
serving as the mind-control device for the zombie .
