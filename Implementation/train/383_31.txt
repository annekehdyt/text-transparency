writer-director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man ,
recently widowed ,
learning in the last three week he is hiv-positive ;
he tracks down the one homosexual partner
he ever had ,
ings him to an apartmant and ty him up ,
forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge
if the result come back positive .
intriguing idea sounds better on paper
than it plays out .
jame marsden 's captive is realistically cynical and snotty ,
but the actor 's own artificial mannerism are disconcerting
-- it is like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise .
scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role ,
but his personality-turn from shy guy to kidnapper-on-the-edge is not convincing ,
and neither are the conversation
the two man have .
marsden 's gay party boy is not apathetic 
of course
-- he is momantarily sympathetic to speedman 's plight --
but he does not react or behave the way
any homosexual man would in this circumstance .
the movie is not a cop-out 
exactly ,
but it is a fraud ,
handicapped further by the bad editing 
the poorly-conceived flashback 
the low-budget production 
and the big finale
which smack of silly pretension and soapy melodrama .
*1/2 from ****
