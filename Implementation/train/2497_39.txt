as a disclaimer 
i have seen the movie 5-6 time in the last 15 year ,
and i only just saw the musical this week .
this allowed me to judge the movie
without being tainted by what
was or was not in the musical
( however 
it tainted me
when i watched the musical :
) )
i actually believe
michael douglas worked quite well in that role 
along with kasey .
i think
her 'let me dance for you scene '
is one of the best part of the movie 
a worthwhile addition
compared to the musical .
the dancer
and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical ,
as well as the cast which is at least 10 time bigger
( easier to do in the movie of course ) .
the decor 
lighting 
dancing 
and singing are also much superior in the movie ,
which should be expected ,
and was indeed delivered .
the song
that were in common with the musical
are better done in the movie ,
the new one are quite good one ,
and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion ,
especially compared to a musical
which has few decor .
the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cut between the actor talking ,
and dubbed singer during the singing portion for some of the character ,
but their dancing is impeccable ,
and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
