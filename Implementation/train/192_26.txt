this effort is based on the true story of jim morris 
a high school science teacher/baseball coach ,
who is inspired by his player
to try out for the pro
and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the major .
dennis quaid 
no stranger to sport film ,
play morris with enough conviction
to make the part work
and the producer do a credible job of recreating the real-world event
that led to morris ief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull tampa bay devil ray .
the first half of the film ,
dealing with his rag tag bunch of high school baseball player
( all of whom look way too old
to actualy
be in high school )
is less effective
and probably a bit too long .
overall the film does suffer from some pacing issue and a few extra subplot
that we probably could have done without .
however 
it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme
that proves once again
that baseball is the national pastime for a reason .
grade :
b-
