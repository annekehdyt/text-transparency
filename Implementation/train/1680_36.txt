this movie was pretty absurd .
there was a few funny part .
its goes right in to the bin of movie in my memory
where i think ,
`` hmm ... ..that movie had a few funny part 
but overall 
pretty ridiculous plot
( or lack of ) .
`` i thought
it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard
to be a cooky funny guy .
and i did not understand
how he was a self made multi-millionaire
and still such an idiot .
anyway 
i like ben affleck .
he makes some crap ,
but hey 
i can forgive him .
i mean 
i liked jersey girl 
i did not think
gigli was all his fault 
i like him overall .
i guess
he is kinda like the kid you feel
sorry for cuz he just can not seem to get
it right.my advice would be to avoid this flick .
it did not really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g. were not used as well
as they could have been .
they deserved better .
overall 
this movie is not home alone ,
it is not a christmas story ,
its not christmas vacation or any of the other classic .
forever forgettable .
