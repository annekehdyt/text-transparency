this is one of the worst movie i
have ever seen
it is extremely boring with lot of boring dialog
and has some very annoying character and a laughable
looking creature .
the only reason i
watched this piece of garbage
is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got .
the plot is preposterous and totally stupid
as is the finale .
no blood what so ever except a few bloody mark on the creature 
and a couple of bloody gunshot wound .
the acting is terrible ! ! .
richard cardella is terrible
as the sheriff
and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying .
glen robert is the comic relief
and was not funny at all ! .
mark siegel is extremely annoying
and was also not funny ! .
bob hyman is decent
but not much more then that .
richard garrison is annoying
and had no chemistry with kacey cobb what so ever .
kacey cobb is so so here
and had no chemistry with richard .
overall avoid this piece of garbage at all cost !
bomb out of 5 .
