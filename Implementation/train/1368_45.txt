oh what a condescending movie !
set in los angele 
the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmaker 
this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst.stereotyped 
smarmy character of widely varying socio-economic background cross path in their everyday 
humdrum life .
the plot is disjointed and desultory .
numerous unimaginative plot contrivance keep the film going 
like :
a drive-by shooting ,
an abandoned baby left in the weed 
a gang of thug intimidating a lawyer 
a guy flying through the night sky over the city 
a kid at summer camp.and through all these event ,
the one constant is the generous helping of sociological `` insight '' imparted through the dialogue ,
as character compare note on their life experience .
one character tells another :
`` when you sit on the edge of that thing
( the grand canyon ) ,
you realize what a joke we person are ; ... those rock are laughing at me ,
i could tell 
me and my worry ; it is real humorous to that grand canyon '' .and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all :
`` there is a gulf in this country ,
an ever widening abyss between the person
who have stuff and the person
who do not have ...
it is like this big hole
has opened up in the ground 
as big as the ... grand canyon ,
and what is come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage ,
and the rage creates violence ... '' .aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue 
aside from the shallow 
smarmy character 
aside from the dumb plot ,
the story 's pace is agonizingly slow .
acting is uninspired and perfunctory .
the film 's tone is smug and self-satisfied ,
in the script 's contempt for viewers.this was a film project
approved by hollywood suit
who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus ,
looking down from on high .
they think
their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly 
unknowing movie goer ,
eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change .
