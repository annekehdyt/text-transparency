trudy lintz
( rene russo )
was one very fortunate lady many year ago .
she was the wife of a wealthy doctor
and had lot of extracurricular money .
her passion was animal
and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry one on her property ground .
trudy also raised two chimp in her home to be more like child .
they dressed in clothe
and had many amenity .
one day 
she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla .
knowing nothing about the large apes ,
she relies on her husband 's medical ability and expert advice
to save the gorilla 's life .
once out of danger ,
trudy decides
she will raise the gorilla 
also 
as one of her child .
this works well for year and buddy 
the gorilla 
is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home .
but 
buddy is also a gorilla and his strength
and curiosity become quite enormous .
will trudy be able to keep buddy under control ?
for those
who love animal ,
buddy is a must-see movie .
based on a true story ,
trudy and her ape develop a relationship
that is unique in the annal of animal history and lore .
of course 
buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one 
in the film ,
but he is very close to seeming totally real .
russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time
and the supporting player are also quite nice .
the costume are exemplary ,
as befitting the earlier era of the story 
and the setting and production value outstanding .
but 
most importantly 
animal are here in abundance ,
not only buddy 
but the adorable chimp 
the duck 
the rabbit 
and so forth .
for those
who want to watch a film
and be transported to animal heaven 
here on earth ,
this is a great movie choice .
all animal lover 
and even those
who just want to watch a great family film ,
will go `` ape '' over buddy .
