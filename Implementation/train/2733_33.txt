there are exactly 2 good thing to be said about `` fantasy ''
( both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well ) :
a )
bo derek 's extraordinary 
poetry-inspiring beauty .
she has shots in this movie
where she gives even catherine zeta-jone a run for her money ,
and that is a high compliment indeed .
her nudity is ief and discreet ,
but just looking at her face is enough.b )
the greek island setting 
with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.other than that ,
there is no story ,
the dialogue is abysmal and at time unintentionally funny
( `` he touched you
where you are a woman !
`` ) 
and peter hooten 's character is a slimy jerk .
bo overplays the naivete of her character ,
but then again
when you have to work with dialogue this bad
it is unfair to blame the actor
( the fact
that she kept saying
the name `` damir '' in almost every sentence is a major irritation ) .
oh ,
and although the film is set on a greek island ,
there is hardly a greek word
to be heard -
apparently everyone there 
from kid to old person 
speaks english the whole time .
