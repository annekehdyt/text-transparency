not that i was really surprised
... .movie are never as good as the book
that they originated from .
i was looking forward to seeing this movie
because this is one of my favorite book ,
even though i knew
it would probably suck .
i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised .
however 
they strayed from the book 's storyline too much ,
and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was .
ending was different too .
lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery .
the acting was unremarkable at best .
perhaps if a theatrical version was made so
that they would not have to stay so much in lifetime 's `` made for tv movie '' box ,
it would be a better flick .
if you saw
this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book
and read it .
i doubt you will be disappointed
and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it .
