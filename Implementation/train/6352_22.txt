0* 's christian slater 
tara reid 
stephen dorff 
frank c. turner 
mathew walker 
will sanderson .
directed by uwe boll.based on the video game director uwe boll attempt to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly
he does not succeed .
instead he makes one of the worst movie
ever made !
even though he gets minor celeity such as christian slater 
tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamental
that a movie needs to be good such as a story line ,
and some basic relativity of what is going on in the dark and the light .
the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control .
and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monster .
even though they did look cool
and the feeding were well 
a little lame .
honestly this is one of the worst movie
ever made .
my final rating 0/10 .
