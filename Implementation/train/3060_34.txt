i watched this film not expecting much
and not knowing anything much about it .
i loved it .
a very good 
tight plot 
an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly 
fat 
deaf girl and the ex-con 
and a pace
that kept thing flowing
without being hurried .
a much 
much better film than the same director 's de battre mon coeur s'est arret\u00e9 ,
which was boring and unbelievable.the only thing
that did not quite work
was that the supposedly ugly 
fat girl was neither ugly nor fat :
solid 
certainly 
and far from conventionally beautiful ,
but with so much character in her face
that she took over the screen
whenever
she was on it .
superb .
i wish
she was in more film ,
and better one than she generally is .
i have seen a bit of gille ' wife and a bit of the moustache ,
and they both looked like rubbish ,
and i have seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arret\u00e9 ,
and that certainly is rubbish .
she seems to have a few coming up ,
so i will keep my finger crossed .
