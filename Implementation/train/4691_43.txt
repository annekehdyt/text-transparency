i was up late flipping cable channel one night
and ran into this movie from about 10 minute into the start - every time i even thought going to bed ,
something kept on telling me to keep on watching it
even though it was way way way past my bedtime.this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film ,
but instead they chose to examine the aftereffect of the shooting .
and even better 
the movie kept on with the real life -
just
when you think
they are going to take the easy
and obviously contrived way out 
a twist comes along
and changes the whole outlook of the movie .
this film not only does not follow the formula ,
it shows
how other event often lead up to and/or affect
what happens
afterwards.i only wish
the filmmaker had explored the issue around anti-depressant drug
more - the kid from columnbine
who did the shooting
were on them for year
and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time
the nightmare started .
up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effect the drug have .
it was very refreshing to see
that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film ,
having a relative
who suffers from a mental illness ,
i can say
that the movie was dead nut on in every aspect of mental illness .
bravo to the director and writer
who obviously did their homework on those issue .
and for those
who think
certain thing could not happen in a hospital
( i do not want to tell any particular ) ,
you are dead wrong on that too - i have been there .
the script was so real
it was amazing.go buy this film
and show it to your teenage kid
before it is too late .
someday they will thank you for it .
