the original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level
concerning some guy
who turn cat into human flesh eating monster
because the cat food
they make
is made with person
is remade with scifi element added .
the cat can not get enough
and when the flesh tainted food run out the cat turn on their owner .
poorly put together on almost every level
this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material
that used to actually play movie theater in the early 1970 's updated with alien cat and dog race
battling for supremacy .
director ted mikel is a hack ,
but is so lovable a person
( i generally like the guy thank to his smile inducing interview and commentary track )
that you can pretty much excuse the garbage
he mostly turned out .
mikel wanted to make film
and he did not care
how they turned out so long
as he was producing something .
more power to him ,
but i wish
he would not subject us to his home movie
