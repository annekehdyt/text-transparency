the thing
that really gets me about this movie
( that is 
the thing about this movie
that makes me physically ill )
is that someone actually paid to have it made .
there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie .
it is not frightening ,
it is not thought provoking ,
it is not entertaining ,
it is not good .
it is a sleeping pill
made of cyanide .
the dvd case compares it to blair witch ,
evil dead 
and a few other decent movie ,
making the filmmaker 's desperation glaringly obvious .
it is nothing like any other movie ever made ;
it is far 
far worse .
the claim of an `` extremely shocking ending
you will never forget ''
are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse dropping .
please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash ,
because it may make you sterile .
the man
who wrote this movie
should be wiped off the writer 's guild membership list ,
and never allowed to film anything again .
because
if he thought
this was a movie worth making ,
he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future .
zero star .
may grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough
to see this .
i am going to go vomit now .
