luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth .
unfortunately 
her role required no .
she did not say much
and looked pale throughout the film .
luise 's character was a slave
then given away to marriage to paul muni 's character
( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) .
set in ancient asia ,
both actor were not asian ,
but were very convincing in their role .
i hope
that paul muni received an oscar for his performance ,
because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for .
she must have been a eakthrough actress 
one of the first to method act .
this seems like something
that hollywood does often .
al pacino has played an italian and cuban .
i felt luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout ,
and
when she died ,
she did not change in expression from any previous scene .
she stayed the same throughout the film ;
she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice .
if her illiant acting was so subtle ,
i suppose i did not see it .
