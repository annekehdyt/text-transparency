the crimson river is one of the most over-directed 
over-the-top ,
over-everything mess i have ever seen come out of france .
there is nothing worse than a french production
trying to out-do film
made in hollywood
and cr is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror/action/buddy flick .
i almost stopped it halfway through
because i knew
it would not amount to anything but french guy
trying to show-off.the film starts off promisingly 
like some sort of expansive horror film ,
but it quickly shifts genre 
from horror to action to x-file type to buddy flick ,
that in the end 
cr is all of it
and also none of it .
it is so full of clich\u00e9s
that at one point i thought
the whole thing was a comedy .
the painful dialogue and those silent pause 
with fade out and fade in just at the right expositionary moment 
made me groan .
i thought
only film made in hollywood
used this hackneyed technique.the chase scene ,
with vincent cassel running after the killer 
is so over-directed and over-done
that it is almost a thing of beauty .
the climax on top of the mountain 
with the stupid revelation about the killer
( s )
with cassel and reno
playing `` buddy '' like nolte and murphy in 48 hrs ,
completely derailed what little credibility
the film
had by then.it
is difficult to believe
that the director of the crimson river also directed gothika ,
which though had its share of problem ,
does not even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked 
confused film .
