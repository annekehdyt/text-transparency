i remember reading all the horrible 
horrible review for this film
when it came out .
i meant to go see
how horrible it was but it was out of theater in three week .
the only other movie
to manage
that is gigli .
when the movie came out on dvd ,
i bought it to see
how awful it was .
i could not think of the sheer horrible attention
that this film was getting
was possible .
after seeing it ,
i can understand .
first off 
let me say
that this film is not without some cool shot .
there is a nice shot at the beginning
that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun ,
which
i thought
was neat .
and the way the monster in this movie die is sort of cool to look at ;
but it gets old after the first time you see it .
let me start with the worst thing in this movie :
tara reid .
if bad acting was a sin ,
then hell would 've chucked tara reid right out
since she is so unbelievably awful in this movie
it is unthinkable .
and of all the role 
she plays a curator .
now
if she played a dumb ,
empty- headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her
for how she treats her character .
apparently 
uwe boll did not realize that ,
although he did seem to think
that if she took off her shirt in the movie ,
person would see it .
he just did not realize
that making her do
that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad .
and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping ?
i could not tell .
which ings me to my next complaint :
uwe boll shows off some of the worst
directing skill
you
will ever see in a movie .
i mean 
i would give house of the dead an f
( and i only do that for very few movie )
but hotd would score at least a b
compared to this screwed up piece of junk .
the movie starts off with a very 
very long narration
that causes immediate confusion
( and read by a horrible narrator )
and from there ,
the cut are really ,
really dumb .
there is this one point
where slater and reid are looking around a building
that is been destroyed and the screen blackens out .
when it comes back ,
slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly ,
an entire army has joined them .
huh ?
and someone did not bother checking the mistake in this movie .
at one point 
a team eaks through glass 
but the glass eaks
before they touch it .
tara reid 's earring switch color in the middle of one scene
and after slater walk away from a dead comrade ,
you can see her begin to get up .
as for the story ... i was really lost .
something about an old tribe releasing darkness
and someone `` opens the path '' or something
and all the evil monster pop out .
it is just an excuse
to have a lot of gun scene
( the technology is so advanced here
that no character ever needs to reload in this film )
that get 
quite simply 
boring .
i bought this movie
hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was .
i did not laugh ,
but i still think
it is stupid .
very 
very 
very stupid .
