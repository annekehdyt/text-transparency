a beautiful piece of child 's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism .
setting the story around the famous book of kel ,
believed to have been comprised by monk from the small island of iona 
off the western coast of scotland.telling the tale of a young abbot apprentice
who goes off into the forest in search of crom-cruic 
the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology .
in hope of recovering a lost artefact.the film true beauty
lies in its ' animation .
cell shaded in a ight and inspirational style of deep complexity
resulting in a look of seem less simplicity .
deriving much from the artistic style of the illiant cartoon network series 'samurai jack ' for its genius use of mark making and background depth ,
the secret of kel creates a consistently affective celtic world
living under the shadow of viking invasion.the history
may be intensely inaccurate and the way of life portrayed lacking realism
but these fact are utterly irrelevant
as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic-revivalist mysticism .
the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition
and in my opinion makes the picture what it is ,
as she glides from anch to anch .
appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with quality resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland.the secret of kel is an absolute treat .
for all gender 
all age 
it is a lovely piece of family cinema.do
not expect to be awed
but instead pleasantly impressed !
