jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best western ever
made
and this is one of the best.the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rocky
that serve as a backdrop for the story .
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.in all five of the western
that stewart and mann did together
the supporting role were perfectly cast .
no exception here 
right down to part
that might only have a few line ,
the character are firmly etched with those line.stewart is a cynical hard-bitten loner in this film
whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan .
it is brennan 's death at the hand of the villain
that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guy
and incidentally redeem himself in the process.john mcintire
is the head villain of the piece
and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range .
he could play delightful old codger 
authority figure and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain .
one of the best western ever .
