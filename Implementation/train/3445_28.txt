i saw this for free 
thankfully ,
and wish
it was better
than it was ,
but it is really the same old stuff
that movie studio seem to foist on us in the last ten years.ben stiller and jennifer anniston play a couple
who are opposites-
and yet they are attracted to each other.if
that plot line does not take you by surprise
and thrill you ,
the movie will not either.lots of sight gag and fart joke .
halfway through the movie i began to realize
that ben stiller really is not that funny ,
but he tries very hard .
and jennifer anniston really is not that pretty ,
but her hair looks great .
and hank azarium and phillip seymore hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money
to be in this kind of average ho-hum movie ,
i have come to expect more from them.what was interesting was
that i saw this
after i saw american splendor ,
which is a truly funny and original movie- and i
compared the two in my head ,
and found myself wishing
that the movie executive would be forced to sit through those two movie back to back- perhaps
that would knock some sense into them andthey had start making better movie with unknown rather than this formulaic stuff
that plays best on airplane .
