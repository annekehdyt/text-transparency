spoilers.first off 
nothing really happened in this movie 
other than a woman bleeding inexplicably .
second 
it was not scary .
third 
it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever .
let me elaborate .
the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead \u0096 i am
not sure
which ,
so let 's just go with beavis .
the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the person mumble and mutter ,
forcing you to turn up the volume
( i watched this at home ) .
then beavis blasts some really loud sound with supposedly scary/shocking image ,
forcing you to quickly lower the volume again .
this occurs many time until 
mercifully 
the movie ends .
i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror
while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time .
if you have child and prefer to watch scary movie
after they fall asleep ,
this one is a big mistake .
but then it is a big mistake anyway .
here is a thought \u0096
if you are going to make a horror movie 
at least add a gratuitous beheading 
a 19-year-old blond girl
who screams at the top of her lung
just before she can take off her sweater ,
the shadow on the wall of someone
being eaten alive just out of the camera range ,
a cat being thrown at the camera
to scare the audience 
some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh 
or a monster
who looks like a stage hand
covered in aluminum foil
( a la tv 's lost in space ) .
these person did not even try to scare me .
they just wanted to hurt my ears .
