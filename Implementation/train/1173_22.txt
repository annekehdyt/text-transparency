i just watched this movie
and have to say ,
i was very impressed .
it is very creepy
and has numerous moment
that will make you jump out of seat !
i had to smoke several `` emergency '' cigarette along the way
to calm my nerve !
if i had to criticise ,
i would say
that perhaps if anything ,
there were too many jump moment .
it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect ,
because you kind of new what was coming.although
it contains virtually every clich\u00e9 in the ghost genre ,
they were all done so well
that it maintained the creepy 
fear-factor .
it had element of the shining 
the 6th sense and the changeling
( in particular 
the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling ) .i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare !
