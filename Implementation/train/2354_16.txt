this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime .
cool title 
excellent director
( i saw `` to die for '' and `` drugstore cowboy '' before this ) ,
and hey - uma thurman in the cast .
how can you go wrong ?
well 
that is a question
that throbbed in my temple for hour after i watched this turkey.disjointed and unfunny in an attempt
to be offbeat ,
this is a dead-zone of a movie
that should be avoided at all cost .
its critical lambasting was well deserved .
you have here one of those rare film
that does not contain a single redeeming quality .
zero out of **** .
