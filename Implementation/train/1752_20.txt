jean luc godard 's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film
as you are likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker .
bit of political theater 
mind-numbingly boring and interminable 
are interspersed with the making of `` sympathy for the devil '' ,
featuring the rolling stone in the studio.the process of the song 's development 
from mick jagger
playing a demo on acoustic guitar ,
to the backing vocal being recorded towards the end ,
is fascinating ,
and it is worth renting this film
just to see the bit with the stone .
almost half the movie is devoted to this ,
so thank to the miracle of chapter stop ,
you can skip all the bizarre political skit
and just watch the stone put a song together.when i had this on laserdisc 
i valiantly attempted to watch it all ,
but i do not see how anyone could get through it .
i finally gave up
and just chapter-skipped my way to the stone segment .
