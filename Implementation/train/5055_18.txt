i really looked forward to see planet of the apes ,
but it was a huge dissapointment.the setting and mask are great ,
but that is the only good aspect of the film .
all other thing are really annoying .
mark wahlberg is not acting ,
he is just in the movie ,
looking stupid .
the other actor are also not very good.but the worst point of all ,
is the story .
it is absolutely ridiculous !
for example :
the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground ,
but the human don`t attack them 
no 
they wait
until they are up again !
this is just one example for the stupid story ,
but it would take too long to tell them all .
