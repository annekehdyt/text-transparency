bogmeister and other have pretty much nailed this .
shore leave is really tos ' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi
( which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribble ) .
it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewer a needed respite from the universe threatening consequence of 
for example 
the corbomite manouever.looking for a place
to chill out for a while ,
the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet ,
and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look .
soon enough all kind of absurdity
begin to take place - some seemingly perilous -
but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremity played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery
( mccoy has gone through the looking glass ) ,
psychological thriller
( kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past ) ,
and romantic comedy
( no comment )
.tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise ,
so it is easy to forget how many episode in the first season focused on heavy-handed 
potentially calamitous drama .
unlike later series franchise writer 
tos ' production team was not afraid to literally go
where no tv series had gone before .
and shore leave ,
despite its occasional problem ,
is an example .
my only criticism of this episode is that the cast
( particularly shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor )
did not seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st 's theme .
the last scene is possibly one of the worst scene
i can remember from the entire tos run - both compositionally and in term of acting .
'nuff said .
my recommendation - see it
while watching the entire first season
as it was meant to be seen -
it order .
