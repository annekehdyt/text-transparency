the very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist ,
and my thought was :
`` this is almost too beautiful . ''
and it goes on like this :
image of landscape and animal
that look like a series of romantic painting ,
each of them perfect in every detail .
even the girl 's room 
her father 's car - everything is nostalgic 
romantic 
beautiful .
this could seem outdated and escapistic ,
but it fits a story
that is itself of silent beauty ,
happening on the border between life and fairy tale 
between dian fossey and le petit prince .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
the extreme parsimony of the movie ,
having a simple 
slow story 
just one actor and hardly any special effect ,
exerted a strong magic .
i therefore find it deplorable
that this parsimony is given up in the last minute ,
when suddenly two additional actor
( the girl as a grown-up woman 
and her son )
are introduced .
another shortcoming is the music ,
which is often intrusive 
hollywood-like ,
and sometimes inappropriate :
i could not ing an english pop-song together with french mountain glory .
i went to the movie together with my two small daughter ,
but i recommend it to adults as well ,
given that they appreciate this kind of movie .
obviously 
not everybody does .
