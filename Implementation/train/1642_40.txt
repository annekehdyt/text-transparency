i have to say 
from the beginning ,
when i watched the stargate movie movie i was not blown away or anything
it was like an average sci fi movie 
with a lot of potential 
though the movie was not as 
erm 
amazing as other sci fi movie such as star war or alien ,
which
if u are a sci fi fanatic u
will admit one of those two title are amazing ,
even though i am not as hardcore sci fi fan as some person ,
i do not remember one line from either of those movie 
i am not a big fan of wearing star war t shirt 
in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you 
ah getting slightly off the point here 
well my point is that the that you do not have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series 
which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing season with no drop in its quality
as it got nearer to its end ,
in 2006.though i did not like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 ,
and let me tell you ,
the special effect were only one of the illiant thing about the series ,
the chemistry between the character just blew me away the special affect ,
were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today .
i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi
if it was not for stargate ,
and my dad ,
who actually got me into sci fi
when i was like 6 ,
and i am glad
he did ,
other wise i would not have seen the illiant shows like sg1 ,
which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movie ,
basically if a new sci fi series is not better or as good as sg1 ,
its not worth watching .
basically this is the best sci fi show to date ,
and
if you do not watch this ,
then you have no idea
what you are missing !
