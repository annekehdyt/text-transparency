this movie is so aggrivating .
the main character looks
like he is 35
and i have seen scrawny beanpole with more ball than this guy .
the plot twist are so predictable its not even worth
watching for the humor factor.also some of the worst dialogue i
have heard in 3 year ,
`` let go find a small animal to torture '' .ugh ...
..i can not even continue ,
do not watch this pile of garbage ,
it was made in 8 days.the
one highlight is the drunk dude
calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.2/10 
unwatchable
