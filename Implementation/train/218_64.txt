a sequel
to ( actually a remake of )
disney 's 1996 live-action remake of 101 dalmation .
cruella devil
( glenn close )
is released from prison
after being `` cured '' of her obsession with fur by a psychologist
named dr. pavlov
( ugh ! ) .
but the `` cure '' is oken
when cruella hears the toll of big ben ,
and she once again goes on a mad quest
to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.this movie is bad on so many level ,
starting with the fact
that it is a `` thanksgiving family schlock '' movie
designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine .
glenn close over-over-over-over-acts as cruella .
with all
that she had to put up with in this movie
-- the lame script 
the endless makeup 
getting baked in a cake at the end --
i hope
they gave her an extremely-large paycheck .
( speaking of which ,
where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory 
a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line ,
and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building
-- as you do in the climax of this film ? )
of course 
the real star of the movie are supposed to be the dog .
they serve as the `` macaulay culkin 's '' of this movie ,
pulling all the stupid `` home alone '' gag on the villain .
( biting them in the crotch ,
running over their hand with luggage cart ,
squirting them with icing 
etc. 
etc. 
etc. 
ad nauseum . )
i have to admit ,
the dog were fairly good actor
-- much better than the human.gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out french furrier .
the two human `` dog lover ''
-- rehashed from the earlier film 
but with different actor --
are completely boring .
when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant ,
the movie cuts back and forth between the two lover ,
and their dog at home ,
watching the dinner scene from `` lady and the tramp . ''
i thought to myself 
`` oh please 
do not go there ! ''
i half-expected the human to do a satire on the `` lady and the tramp '' dinner scene
-- as charlie sheen did in `` hot shot :
part deux '' --
doing the `` spaghetti strand kiss 
''
pushing the meatball with his nose ,
etc.and do not get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idle 's voice.the costume were nominated for an oscar 
and the costume in the movie *are* good .
but they are the only good thing in the movie .
the rest of it is unbearable dreck .
