the only part lacking in this movie is shue 's part as the daughter wanting
to follow in her `` aunt 's '' footstep as a daytime soap star .
otherwise it would be a perfect 10.it seems
that every actor enjoyed their part and overacting
to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - i have to wonder
if a little ad lib'ing was not taking place in part .
it was well cast
and there are some classic line
that will stick with you.it is a fantastic movie
everyone should see at least once .
i would recommend not drinking anything
that would sting coming out your nose.you will definitely want to watch the last scene closely 
'nurse nan ' has a little secret
she had rather not have shared with you.if you love daytime soap or despise them ,
this move pokes fun in all the right place .
