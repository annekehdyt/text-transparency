shot into car from through the windscreen ,
someone is playing someone else their latest song ,
someone else did not react ,
according to the voice-over .
i just wonder how that came to be made .
there were too many scene in this movie
that i wondered about how come a camera was there .
if the scene shot
where the warhol descended on a bjm post-party are true
then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max 
if not ,
then it was a total faication ,
either way it made me uncomfortable ,
if that was the purpose ?
all the way thru this movie i kept wondering
how the footage came about .
taken at face value 
a nice portrait of the ( tortured )
genius we all believe ourselves to be .
