the more i analyze this film 
the worse it becomes .
first of all 
why a motivational speaker ?
that part was just stupid .
i mean 
why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker ?
is alexander stone really that disorganized ?
first he can not decide what he wants to do to control the world ,
so he looks to the bible for idea .
many of these idea 
i might add ,
really have no reliability
( for example ,
the part of the `` the house of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror ''
could have already happened .
it could have been have been the synagogue burned during krystalnacht and the mosque could very well have been the mosque blown up in baghdad or something . )
and gillen lane 's family !
they had no part
except to provide a family value platfrom and dab their eye with water !
i might add
that since casper van dien/gillen lane is only in his twenty
( or that is the impression
that i had )
and has a ten year child ,
he had his child during high school .
yeah 
there goes tbn 's family value .
also 
why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like ?
i will repeat what an earlier reviewer said .
the indiana jone flick use christian mythology as a plot dvice
and manipulate it well so
that we are intoxicated .
this film does not do that .
the beginnig starts off well 
with michael ironside
playing a priest
who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy 's omega code .
then
when confronted by two man
who he is obviously afraid of ,
the two prophet tell him `` tell your master
that we are here ! `` .
dominic
( ironside )
replies `` he already knows '' and point to a small surveillance camera .
that part sent chills up my spine .
had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film .
i will give michael york credit :
he does a fine job
of acting out his character ,
as does michael ironside .
but the good guy are horrible .
i have already went on about lane 's family .
now that i am over the acting ,
i will get on to plot .
this is obviously a baptist film ,
since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf .
the world domination plot i liked
and found plausible and subtle ,
as were the action sequence were also thrilling and well-done .
also another diatribe against the vatican ,
their leader are seen as dogmatically minded ,
since gillen explain to the pope
that it is not the end of the world 
but the beginning of a new one also 
the vatican
( or israelis )
says
their going to secede from the world union aince
they used the omega code
to control the world .
whoever it was ,
they would not just secede ,
they had send over commando and kill them .
this is the equivalent of america
knowing about the kgb going
to kill the president
and simply saying
`` we are not going to talk
to you any more ! `` .
come on !
i did enjoy the scene
where we see bomber headed toward israel
and see them again on the monitor .
mediocre in short .
