when thinking about captivity many word come to mind .
among them are :
uninteresting 
unentertaining 
unsuspensful 
unsexy 
unfathomable 
and unwatchable.i used
to hate those movie from the mid to late ninety
that were basically ripoff of scream
but these new saw knockoff are beginning to make those film look like classic .
they still pander to the same demographic
that those other movie were so successful at doing ,
but now they add a new level of degeneracy
that make the twelve to fourteen year old girl
they are aimed at feel
like they are hardcore
and hip.this movie is a load of boring crap !
what the hell has happened to larry cohen ?
his name has not been attached to anything good since 1993 !
even so 
i was still surprised to see
that he had anything to do with something this bad !
was anyone surprised
when the movie 's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopath ?
did anyone not know it
when they first saw him ?
only someone
who has never before in his or her life ,
ever seen another movie !
