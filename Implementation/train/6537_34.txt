i rented this film out
having heard of the fuss
about it not being put up for an academy award ,
but
after watching it ,
it is easy to see why it did not .
despite the beautiful photography ,
the film is incredibly slow moving ,
despite
having hardly any plot.the plot is about a young boy
trying to come to term with his parent ' death
in what may or may not have been an accident
( the film is never clear on this ) ,
and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy story .
the fairy story contain the only bit of interest in the plot ,
but they are very short ,
and do not really seem to have any point .
the first fairy story in particular concern a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend
to save her life ,
but the boy delay by tasting the flower first
to make sure
it is not poisonous
which result in him being a few second too late
to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces
that the moral is that the boy was too impatient ,
but that does not make any sense
because it was overcaution and slowness
which resulted in his failure .
perfect metaphor for this film really .
the photography of skye is beautiful though 
but then stardust
which was released this year
is another film about fairy story filmed in skye and beautifully photographed -
and it is infinitely better than this one .
