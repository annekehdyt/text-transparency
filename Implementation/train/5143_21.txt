i found this movie hilarious .
the spoofs on other popular movie of that time were some of the funniest i
have seen in this sort of movie .
give it a try .
if you saw the movie
that this movie is spoofing ,
and you get the humor ,
you should enjoy the movie.i
( and the other
who watched the movie with me )
felt the funniest part in the movie
( this is not a spoiler
because i will not tell you what actually happens )
was a scene with the `` flashy thingy '' from mib .
when they first discover the device
and do not know
what it is does ...
and then again later in the movie ... you will understand
when you get there.my only complaint about the movie is
that i have never been able to find it in dvd
so that i could buy a copy .
