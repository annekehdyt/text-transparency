romantic comedy can really go either way ,
you know ?
you will see one that is really sappy ,
and you will think
you want something more realistic .
then 
you will see one that is realistic ,
but it might be too dull
to keep you interested .
or maybe you will see one
that does everything right ,
but just fails to make you smile .
romantic comedy are tough movie .
you go into them with a lot of expectation ,
and usually ,
whether you like it is simply a matter
of whether the filmmake was anticipating your expectation or those of the guy or girl next to you.of course ,
if you have got a girl next
to you ,
and you are a guy like me ,
it probably does not matter all
that much whether the movie 's any good ,
you have got other thing on your mind .
for you ,
i say ,
`` go get her 
tiger ! ''
for the rest of us ,
i say ,
`` see _a guy thing_ . ''
it is a lot of fun.because _a guy thing_ knows
you are going in to this movie with expectation ,
so it does not pretend
that its `` guy about to get married meet the woman of his dream ,
and it is not his wife ! ''
plot is going to make everyone happy .
sure 
maybe you like it ,
but maybe it does not ring true ,
or you think
it is cruel .
_a guy thing_ covers that .
what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best
supporting cast i
have seen in a long time ,
so
if you do not the main plotline ,
you have still got something
to make you smile.whether
we are talking about the seasoned veteran of big and small screen 
like larry miller
( pretty woman 
best in show ) ,
james brolin
( traffic ) ,
julie hagerty
( airplane !
) 
david koechner
( saturday night live and conan o'brien regular 
dirty work 
austin power ii )
or thomas lennon
( the state and viva variety ) ,
or new faces like shawn hatosy
( the faculty ) 
or colin foo
( saving silverman ) ,
we are talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actor
who know exactly how to take advantage of the film 's inspired characterisation ,
steal the show 
time after time ,
and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedy these days.and
that is not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the star
that carry it along ,
because it is very sweet and terribly well done .
jason lee
( mallrat ,
chasing amy 
dogma 
etc . )
is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control ,
and selma blair shows an understated illiance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman
every guy wants to marry except for the guy
who actually is.a lot of the success of the movie 
though 
falls on julia stile 
the right girl in the right place at the wrong time ,
and she wears it well .
not since 
gosh 
i do not know when 
have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy
that has made falling in love with her so easy .
of course 
it is all in the closeup 
the voice 
and the subtle smile ,
but it is magical ,
and it is one of the big reason
why
we go to the movie in the first place.but julie stile 's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact
that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity .
this is a movie
that paints a oken world of irreconcilable stock type 
makes them fall over each other
to make you laugh ,
and then comes through with a great deal of heart.a guy thing is a movie
you have definitely seen before ,
and the filmmaker clearly knew
that
when they set down
to make it .
we have not really seen any new romantic comedy since shakespeare ; the relative success of this one
or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meet girl .
a guy thing does emace
that with a bit of a metacinematic edge ,
often taking the scene into the absurd in order
to give the audience a chance
to acknowledge the powerful emotion and ancient plot device at play.for the record ,
it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notion of sex and gender
that form the center of every romantic comedy ,
so even the feminist out there might get a kick out of it.and guy ,
i think
we can all agree
that we wish our friend are as cool as jason lee 's friend in this movie .
i am not going to spoil it for you ,
but when you try to explain to your girlfriend
why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dude in cinema ,
i suggest you just say
`` it is a guy thing 
''
and leave it at that .
