this movie has beautiful scenery .
unfortunately it has no plot .
in order to have a plot there
must be a conflict .
this movie had none .
it spent two hour painting a beautiful scene
and failed to ever place any activity in it .
the picture tries to be artistic
but fails to pay attention to the fundamental of story telling.if
you love montana scenery
and fly fishing you will find some value in this film
just do not expect a story .
there is not one .
