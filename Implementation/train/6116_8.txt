for a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell `` tearjerker '' in the first ten minute
and turn it off ,
but this was very well made 
with emotional subtlety 
great acting 
and some genuinely funny moment .
it was also interesting to see a different culture - a vanishing one at that .
my wife and i both dug it !
