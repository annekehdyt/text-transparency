well 
well ... .roeg touched a bit of a nerve there ,
did not he ?
he was a genius
while he was cataloguing his various character ' descent into psychosis for a couple of decade ,
but as soon
as he has the bad taste
to suggest
that redemption
( or even some good advice )
might be found in the bad old catholic church ,
the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious .
worse still 
there isa russell 's character - faced with experience
that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for ,
is unwillingly forced to deal with those experience on another level -
that of the spiritual .
you know ,
the realm of the ignorant and superstitious 
the sort of thing
that the art-house cinephile are supposed to be above .
oh 
the horror ...
so she finds her marriage - the idea
that it might be a uniquely important commitment -
affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention .
person
who find this idea prima facie offensive
could maybe ask themselves why
they instinctively jump into attack mode
at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their life .
but they probably will not .
sure 
this film has some problem ,
notably talia shire 's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 
1950s-style attire and all .
and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretation
( though hitchcock 's movie escaped similar charge due to the source of wisdom
having impeccably secular credential as a freudian psychoanalyst ) .
but 
sadly 
nicola roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answer this film present .
