20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter tom oakley .
the boy
( william beech )
is billeted with tom
and it is immediately apparent
that he has serious issue
when he wets his bed on the first night .
william is illiterate and frightened
but somehow the two find solace in each other loneliness .
it transpires
that william has a talent as an artist
and we see tom 's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of jerusalem .
william is befriended by zacharias wrench 
a young jewish lad also from london and along with both tom and zacharias ,
he finally learns to read and write
and to feel a part of this small close knit community .
just as he is settling down ,
william is recalled back to london by his mother ,
and it is here we see
why he is so screwed up .
his mother is clearly mentally sick
and when tom does not hear from william ,
he travels to london to look for him .
he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister
where he has been tied up in a cellar .
after a period in hospital 
tom realise he must kidnap him
and take him home with him .
the climax is a bitter-sweet ending
when william is told
he is to be adopted by tom ,
while at the same time 
learning his best friend zacharias has been killed in an air raid in london .
for me 
one of the most moving scene was
when tom was talking to a official from the home office.i love 'im 
an '
for what it is worth ,
i think
he loves me too'.it just does not get better
that that does it ?
