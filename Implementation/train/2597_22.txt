saw this movie in my english class this afternoon
and was surprised by how bad this version was .
do not get me wrong ,
george c. scott was terrific as scrooge ,
but the rest of the cast fails so very badly .
sometime i could not stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line :
`` merry christmas to everyone ! ''
other time i almost fell asleep.the movie is based on a charle dickens short story about a rich guy ,
who do not think
christmas is nothing but humbug .
after 30 minute 
the rich guy is visited by three ghost ,
who persuade him to celeate christmas
after all.i can not understand how this movie 
with a script so bad
it must have been written in five minute ,
can be so well-rated .
instead of this piece of garbage 
i recommend to you ,
the bill murray comedy scrooged .
that at least 
was funny ...
