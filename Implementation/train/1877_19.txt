an acted/manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest place of guatemala .
portrayed as a fun 
secure ...
but sad place 
were a bunch of sex worker get to play in a soccer team ,
assembled in what seems like no more than a week !
the documentary 's main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of `` worker '' 
even though no solution to these poor woman is ever achieved ,
except that the person
who documented this ,
made them some sort of `` star ''
( just like the title says so )
in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary .
it does have 
however 
its own documented reality ... but ,
that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline .
i would not accept to see it again ;
but i would recommend it for general cultural purpose only .
