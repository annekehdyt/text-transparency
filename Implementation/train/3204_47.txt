a friend of mine gave me this movie .
a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctor
are trying to surgically remove a dvd casing from his *** .
i got quit excited by the prospect of an other michael chabon movie .
after all his novel have ought me much entertainment
and previous screenplay adaptation were great ,
but boy 
was i wrong.first off the person
that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so .
i imagine the casting went something like this .
`` tell me 
do you like fish ? ''
`` yes i enjoy fish very much . ''
`` wonder full 
you are hired .
have some money . ''
than there is the script .
i have read chabon ,
who i hope went blind
before he could see this piece of dong ,
and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel .
i am not quit sure
why it annoyed me like it did ,
but it might have something to do with the fact
that
listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction
would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liner these 2nd degree model massacre kid spat out.this is an actual line from the movie ;
`` if you tell me something
that you have never said out loud to anyone before 
than this moment becomes unique ! ''
unique ?
does it ?
does it really ?
off course not you plank .
please pass me the imodium .
i will have a whole ****ing strip .
the directing is ... well .
i have got nothing .
maybe rawson marshall thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something .
stick to directing comedy .
no stick to directing commercial .
this movie is so horrible
it left me banging my head against a wall
so hard it ought me back to the stone age .
i give it 2 star
because i do not wan na be the guy
that watched a 1 star movie .
