if you hit your head with a shovel ,
write the script with your foot ,
you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie .
there is nothing in this movie
that has not been done a thousand time in other gangster flick
and done much better .
those
who think
`` scarface '' was some kind of hero
to be looked up to or saw `` goodfella '' 
`` menace ii society '' or `` dead president ''
and thought mmm
`` that is the life for me ! ''
will like this movie .
i thought
i would give the movie a chance ,
since the premise was perfect for a prequel .
i should have known better
after seeing mario van peeble and sean comb were involved .
anyone above a 4th grade education ,
see the original with pacino 
a real actor ,
and be satisfied .
