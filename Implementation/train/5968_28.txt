my god this movie is awfully boring .
i am a big fan of gina gershon ,
when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama 
and some great performance from gershon .
gershon is great as always ,
but she is not right actress for this role ,
she is too good for rade serbedzija .
the romance between gershon and serbedzija 's character is too unconvincing .
and i absolutely hated serbedzija 's character
( a wonman organizer ) ,
he is not charming in anyway in the movie .
how did dr. lauren graham
( gershon )
is beyond my comprehension .
maybe sean connery 
robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role ,
but they do not have the european-ish looking i guess .
any way 
i was so bored druing the movie .
if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie ,
check out bound 
her best film so far .
if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man ,
try some harrison ford or sean connery movie .
gina gershon is so underrated ,
and she deserves better chance than this ,
i wish her
to make better choice in the future .
