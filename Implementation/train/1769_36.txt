the music of albeniz pervade this film .
once and a while it is played with original instrumentation
( e.g .
piano 
but never full orchestra ) ,
but often it is re-worked with various contemporary ensemble
( e.g.guitar )
and treatment
( e.g .
jazz piano ) .
only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film :
the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dance 
often flamenco 
but not always .
i would guess
that there are 12\u009614 scene ,
which are not united by a plot .
not all scene will reach the height for an individual viewer .
in my case about half reached the pinnacle ,
though all the rest were in their own way very fine .
those
that worked for me
moved me to goose-flesh aesthetic delight ; indeed ,
the final scene left me weepy with joy .
and in some very magical way it ings you deep into spanish culture .
if you do not like subtitle ,
do not worry .
the film is virtually wordless ,
though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece .
seeing this very beautiful film sharpen my complaint
that virtually none of the film of saura are available on dvd in the usa .
i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of `` carman 
'' a spectacular work of art
that is available in europe but not here
( european dvd 's will not play on american dvd player ) .
this is a scandal .
