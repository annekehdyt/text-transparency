i do not know
if this is a sitcom or not ,
but i agree
that this is one of the greatest television shows ever .
it is great that this show still airs .
and i love michelle .
it is cute on the episode
when she was a baby
and she talked ,
and she sometime said something funny .
aw.this show can relate to child and teen and.. well ,
family as they struggle through rough time
and try to work it out as a family .
i do not know
who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone .
i love the episode
when i think
her name is dd.. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt ,
and she learned a lesson about stealing .
that was a great episode .
an example
that this tv show shows the family
working thing out
as a family.i recommend this show for everyone .
