a french film ester williams would love .
but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girl in a paris exurbia
finding themselves .
no question
where sciamma 's sympathy lie
as all the boy are depicted as `` animaux ''
but actually only the 3 girl are in focus ,
and for the entire time 
with the few adult and the other adolescent being mostly in the background .
marie is a stick of a girl 
unattractive ,
but determined .
she wants to be a swimmer
and force herself on floriane
( a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer )
and she is also a friend of convenience to anna :
not unattractive 
but for her 
the time of her body 's perfection was short ,
and now she is an adolescent in a woman 's body .
what ensues is a journey to self-realization
without a road map
but there is a glumness about the three
that is un-natural :
where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth ?
while the d\u00e9nouement was eath taking 
with floriane 's self-absorption beautifully portrayed 
as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne ,
it all seemed abstract 
sciamma 's puppet .
