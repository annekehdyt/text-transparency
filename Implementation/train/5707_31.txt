i liked how this started out ,
featuring some decent special-effect especially for a film 50 year old .
there was some pretty impressive scenery .
however 
the film bog down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the male all try to flirt with anne francis `` altaira morbius .
`` )
viewing this in the '90 after a long absence ,
it was fun to see francis again ,
an actress
who has done mostly television show
since this film
was released ...
.and is still acting .
it also was interesting to see a young-looking leslie nielsen
( `` dr. john j. adam '' ) ,
who i would not have recognized
had it not been for this voice i
watched half of this movie
before the boredom came almost overwhelming
and i had a strong desire
to go to sleep .
i appreciated them re-doing this vhs tape in stereo .
but it was a weak effort .
this is one those overrated film
where `` elite '' think is so `` heavy '' and `` thought-provoking . ''
that is nonsense .
it only appeared `` intelligent ''
because the rest of the '50s sci-fi film were so stupid !
! some if the early scene would have looked great on wideescreen ,
which i did not have at the time of this writing .
perhaps another look - this time on the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review .
