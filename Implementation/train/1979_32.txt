i do not know
how and where do the iranian director get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this .
in fact 
it is a very simple plot
that many director could come up with
-- -
but may not be able to project
it onto a movie the way
jafar panahi did.the film is like 2 world revolving at the same time 
one
connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sex
that is going on behind the wall of the stadium.it makes
you feel
like you are in the movie
and you are one of the character ,
and while watching the movie ,
as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match .
you will feel
exactly the same excitemant and sentimant as those female actor in the movie .
it is gripping in a way
that you wanted to see the ending ,
you will want to find out the verdict ,
you will be dying to see what will happen to the girls.i like the intermittent conversation between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee .
it is like venus vs mar ,
it really shows the difference in the thinking of man and woman and the struggle of woman
to get equal right and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society
like iran.this is the second movie of jafar panahi
that i have seen
( the first being crimson gold )
and am looking forward
to watching some more.am already hooked with iranian movie
and this one is a must-see !
