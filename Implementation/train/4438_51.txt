`` drawing restraint 9 '' is a kind of movie one
either loves or hates ;
fortunately or not 
i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time
and of being thoroughly stuffed with `` killing whale is bad '' propaganda .
aesthetically 
the movie could have been pleasing 
especially its first half ,
until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspect of whale hunting .
until then 
it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chore of japan worker ,
but later it becomes obvious
that anything
that appears on the screen
is a propaganda ,
and no single frame is an exception .
i use the word `` propaganda ''
because the movie uses basically the old morality play device ,
where `` good '' and `` bad '' are not deduced in the course of action
but are set in stone .
probably it is just me ,
but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived ,
even when it is all about the noble
( no sarcasm here )
quest
of protecting the environment.in my opinion
it is a cardinal sin
when a movie material is stretched out
without any justification ,
for the sake of stretching only .
in my opinion 
`` drawing restraint 9 '' could have been easily fit into 75 minute ,
but has a torturous length of 2 and 1/4 hour .
yes 
there were interesting shot ,
but there were not enough of these
to leave 15-minute gap of nothingness
without notice .
the movie has no standard scenario ,
and there is no evolution of character ,
but neither it is a documentary ,
it is rather a kind of conceptual installation .
that is an unusual form for a movie ,
but it still can be viewed as art
even when the concept is as simple and naive as here .
otoh i also believe
that the director should have had some honesty
and did not pretend
that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minute.and yes 
the music score mostly resembled whale sound .
how surprising.2/10 .
