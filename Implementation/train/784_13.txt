this is one of my favourite kung-fu film
and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brother from the late 70 's .
the plot is interesting and twisty ,
the character are cool each with their own style - toad 
snake 
lizard etc .
the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh / venom film
but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu style on display from the various character .
i recommend this film to those
who think
all shaw brother especially chang cheh 's film are the same ,
most of his film usually focus on the 10 tiger and shaolin vs manchu conflict .
this film is eath of fresh air in comparison .
