tara reid as an intellectual 
christian slater
( usually great )
as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff
as ... well it is stephen dorff for christ sake ! ! ! !
i personally just want to thank those illiant casting director for the hard work and effort .
you guy are on .
here an idea 
just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public
but it follows directly with your previous choice 
a movie about the most illiant neuro-physicist in history
invent one pill to cure all disease
ever
known to man and get this ,
here the clincher
they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton .
i knew you
guy would love that .
seriously
though you owe me $ 7.50 .
