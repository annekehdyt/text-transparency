this movie is just so awful .
so bad
that i can not bear to expend anything other than just a few word .
avoid this movie at all cost ,
it is terrible.none of the detail of the crime are re-enacted correctly .
lot of slaughterhouse footage .
weird cut and edit .
no continuity to the plot .
the acting is absolutely the most amateur i
have ever seen.this bomb of a movie was obviously made
to make some money
without any regard to the accuracy
of it is content .
the camera work is out of focus at time and always shaky .
it looks
as if it was shot on video.in fact ,
now that they have got dennis rader with life in prison ,
i wish
they would put the guy
that made this horrible movie into prison as well.seriously ,
do not even think about watching this one .
i would give it a negative star
if i could .
