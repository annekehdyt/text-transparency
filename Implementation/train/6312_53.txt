i had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of marcello mastroianni 's passing with numerous unwatched film of his
that i own on vhs ; however ,
given my ongoing light-hearted christmas marathon ,
i had to make do with just this one !
as it happens ,
it features one of his best performance -
and he was justly oscar-nominated for it
( with the film itself being likewise honored ) .
this was also one of 14 collaboration
with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from italy 
sophia loren ; both 
incidentally 
are playing against type here -
she as an unglamorous housewife
and he a homosexual !
by the way 
the film 's title has a double meaning :
the leading character are ought together on the historic day
in which hitler came to italy to meet mussolini
( the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage ) ,
but it more specifically refer to the star ' 'ief encounter '
in which they share moment of friendship 
revelation and 
iefly 
passion -
though each knows
that a return to their normal existence is inevitable ,
which leads to the film 's aupt bittersweet ending .
this is virtually a two-hander
( with all other character - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block
in which the story takes place in its entirety -
which include loren 's gruff and fervently patriotic husband ,
surprisingly played by john vernon 
appear only at the beginning and closing sequence ) ; still 
the cramped setting does not deter director scola
( for the record 
this is the 7th film of his that i have watched and own 3 more on vhs ) and cinematographer pasqualino de santis 
so that the result - though essentially low-key - is far from stagy : the camera is allowed to prowl the various section of the large building 
observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires 
but always keenly.the narrative 
of course 
depends entirely on the performance of the two star for it to be convincing ,
and they both deliver
( their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable ) ;
it is interesting 
however ,
that
while loren walked away with the prize in their home turf ,
it is mastroianni 's moving yet unsentimental outsider
( the film 
somewhat dubiously 
does seem to equate his sexual deviance with anti-fascism ! )
who generally impressed international audience !
