poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper
who usually makes pretty good horror movie
but he failed pretty bad at this one .
englund plays the well known marque de sade
who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of inging pain
upon himself as well
as watching other also be in pain .
the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused
as to what was going on
and what was the purpose of this movie .
all i saw was a young lady
that became entrapped by a strange lesbian
who desides to keep her to herself
and the young lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out
that he is out to have her killed and then englund step in from one century to another claiming
to be a descendent of the de sade
and try to kill her
because she reminded him of the madam momoselle
( spelled that wrong )
or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall .
the movie was terrible ,
i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this film
and the special effect were so fake and laughable 
especially the part about the eye .
englund try to make a comeback from his
once hit move `` nightmare on elm st. ''
by using these pull in and out needle to put out people eye .
terrible 
absolutely terrible .
