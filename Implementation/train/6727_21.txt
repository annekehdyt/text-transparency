i do not envy barry levinson 
rachel weisz 
ben stiller or jack black for doing this film .
it is 
in one word 
boring .
maybe the fact
that is too predictable ,
the more-than-exploited ben stiller 's loser role or the not-at-all funny scene make this film just something to forget .
even christopher walken 's appearance finish in a pathetic way .
i was very disappointed .
i love ben stiller 's acting .
i loved it in most of his film ,
the last one i saw
before this was duplex with drew barrymore
and was not that bad .
about jack black ... well 
apart from high fidelity i have never seen him doing something good .
what about school of rock ?
ooop 
frightening .
