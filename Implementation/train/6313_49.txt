(
( nb :
spoiler warning 
such as it is !
) )
first off 
this is a teen slasher flick
-- the spam-in-a-cabin genre ,
as joe bob briggs piquantly put it .
if you are looking for roshambo ,
this is not it
and was not going to be it .
i am desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography ,
directing or acting performances.secondly ,
this was not zuniga 's first horror flick ,
it was her first screen appearance period 
cinema 
tv 
whatever .
for what it is worth ;
neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn.thirdly ,
you have to give even a lame slasher flick prop .
sure 
it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre :
any young woman
having or showing interest in sex
is beef on the hoof ,
and the harvest time is now.except this one gives the chop to the sweet 
virginal protagonist as well !
now there is a mediocre teen death film
that has the courage of its conviction !
interesting that this was said
ingenue 's only film role .
another one hit wonder ,
except that term gives the lass too much credit .
( then again ,
this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actor in history .
of the nineteen credited actor 
a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film .
three appeared in one other movie by the same producer .
only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credit .
what was this ,
the has been and never were mutual aid society ?
) granted 
i saw this a long time ago on late night cable
when i was bored
and never anticipate being that bored in my life again ,
but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved
and toss them in the incinerator with joanne.2/10 .
