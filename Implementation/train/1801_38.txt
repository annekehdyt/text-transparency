wow you guy are way too nice ! !
! corny 
corny 
corny
that is how i feel about
that film.it started well with a good idea 
a guy
( edward asner )
escape from jail dressed as santa 
a bunch of kid find him
and believes his the real santa
so the fake santa enlist the child
to help him find a bag of stolen money.the film
is like a christmas version of `` whistle down the wind '' .
the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point
that at the end it becomes ridiculous
and you just can not take this film seriously .
for example you get the scrooge type character
called sumner
( rene auberjonois )
who 's a total douchebag
who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish ,
he treat his son so bad
that he do not even buy him decent clothe ,
the poor kid wear jeans with hole in it !
but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy
singing christmas carol
and giving his neglected son a hug ... yep
that is how corny it is ... i am all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie
but this one is way too over the top for me ,
it is a shame
because it started well
but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film
that just do not match with the rest of it .
it is not totally bad ,
there are some solid acting 
especially from the child
but there are plenty of better christmas film around .
