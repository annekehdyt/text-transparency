1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3/10
( dir-steve purcell ) :
typical mary kate and ashley fare with a few more kiss .
it looks to me like the girl are getting pretty tired of this stuff
and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up
and go there own way .
in this episode of their adventure they are intern in rome for a `fashion ' designer
who puts them right into the mailroom
to learn
what working hard is all about
( i guess.. ) .
besides the typical flirtation with boy there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about \u00be way into the movie
when it is finally revealed
why they are getting fired 
then re-hired ,
then fired again 
then re-hired again .
this is definetly made by person
who do not understand the corporate world
and it shows in their interpretation of it .
maybe the real world will be their next adventure
( if there is one . ) .
even my kid did not seem to care for this boring `adventure ' in the make-believe .
let 's see they probably only have a couple of year
till their legal adult .
we will see what happens then .
