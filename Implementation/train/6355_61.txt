someone here actually compared this movie in some way to high noon .
now that is a real stretch !
i am a big sinatra fan
including some of his acting role
but maybe the only person
who could have played this part
would
have been don knotts .
first off ,
as someone pointed out ,
sinatra just does not have the build for a western bad-guy wannabe .
he is just too 'slight ' at this point in his life .
maybe he was about the same height
as say audie murphy ,
but murphy had a pretty solid build .
sinatra comes across
as the big talking little kid
who nobody ought to take seriously.the story
is uninspired
and really not credible .
i do not want to spoil it
but i think the ending
and how the townsperson react in this story does not make any sense .
another thing 
these person constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy ' .
this is just a little town ,
so i do not get the attraction nor do i understand
why the person would let themselves be dominated
that way.there is a 'love interest ' in the story
and
if i followed it right ,
she was upset
when the main character refused to admit
who he was so some other bad guy
would not kill him .
now there is true love for you .
'stand up for yourself !
tell him your name so he will kill you ! '
lol .
stop 
you are killing me.unfortunately the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter
how they tried this story
did not have a logical path
to follow other than into the wastebasket .
want to know
why it is not on video
and never shown on tv ?
the critic apparently panned it in 1956
and they were right -
this movie is pretty bad .
i would almost bet sinatra paid
someone to deep six the thing as much
as possible.you want to see a good western
where a town stands up against a bad guy ?
try tension at table rock 
or at gunpoint - two really ,
really good western with that theme .
johnny concho is johnny stinko .
frank 
you were the greatest singer ever -
but you did not belong in a movie like this .
