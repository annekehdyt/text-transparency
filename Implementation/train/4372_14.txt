the idea of in the name of the person is good 
a murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution
and asks the parent of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter .
and you could expect of the actor ,
especially scott bakula to do some good acting ,
unfortunately they do not !
in the name of the person turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker .
the flashback with the girl
that was killed
are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage
you can just predict
what the actor will say ...
if you want to watch a good film about this subject
then watch dean man walking !
