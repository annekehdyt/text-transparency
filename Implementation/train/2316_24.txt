nice attempt and good idea
( redemption of the prostitute ,
human being helping each other out 
... )
but a poor result ... the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance
which is suppose to portray viet nam ...
the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone
and when `` the scent of the green papaya '' had a historical background ...
trying to project this kind of ambiance
( muffled sound and the slow pace of life ... )
on modern day leaves a feeling of fake .
besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom
and the outcome becomes too obvious.i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang
because that is where harvey keitel 
ex-marine in the movie 
was probably stationed during the war ...
but in southern viet nam nobody or very few person speak with the clip northern accent
displayed by the actor ...
seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker.an old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful
( not a disease for person of his condition ) ,
a peasant girl
who can read
and write elaborate vietnamese poetry ,
... even more doubtful ...
