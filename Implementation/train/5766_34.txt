basically this is about a couple
who want to adopt a second child .
at the adoption agency they meet a mouse
( stuart )
and they decide to adopt him .
if you think
that this is stupid ,
hold it ,
because it is getting worse.stuart arrife to his new home ,
where he is treated like a human child .
( spare me ! )
the rest is pretty much the usual clich\u00e9 
about family problem 
jealousy from the elder `` other '' ,
and at the end all issue are resolved
and they are all a `` happy family '' .
boring and worn out as this is 
it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.i do not know
if the director believed
that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich\u00e9 ,
or he was just trying to fill in minute ,
but he only upgraded the clich\u00e9 from boring to abhorrent.then
why i gave a 3 and not a zero ?
because of the family cat ,
who loves stuart as much as the `` other '' .
and because of some funny gig ,
where stuart makes good use of his small size.on the overall i believe
that the film would work reasonably well if :
a. stuart was a pet and not a `` sibling '' .
b. it had kept to the funny gig 
like stuart
trying to outwit the cat ,
and had left out boring clich\u00e9s
which do not even match with anything else .
