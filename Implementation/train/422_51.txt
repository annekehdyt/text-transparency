hilarious 
evocative 
confusing 
illiant film .
remind me of bunuel 's l'age d'or or jodorowsky 's holy mountain
-- lot of strange character mucking about and looking for ... .. what is it ?
i laughed almost the whole way through ,
all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reaction of the audience
that surrounded me in the theatre .
entertaining through and through 
from the beginning to the gut and poisoned entrail all the way to the end ,
if it was an end .
i only wish i could remember every detail .
it haunts me sometimes.honestly 
though 
i have only the most positive recollection of this film .
as it does not seem to be available
to take home and watch ,
i suppose i will have to wait a few more year
until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show
( and subsequent `` what is it ? ''
screening ) ... i saw this film in atlanta almost directly
after being involved in a rather devastating car crash ,
so i was slightly dazed at the time ,
which was perhaps a very good state of mind
to watch the prophetic
talking arthropod and the retard in the superhero costume and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting 
scan notily clad girly rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dream.is it a statement on life
as we know it ?
of course everyone expects art to be just that .
i rather think
that the truth is more evident in the absence and in the negative space .
what you do not tell us is what we must deduce ,
but is far more valid than the ly
that other person feed us day in and day out .
rather one `` what is it ? ''
than 5000 movie like `` titanic '' or `` sleepless in seattle ''
( shudder 
gag 
groan )
.thank you 
mr. glover
( additionally a fun man
to watch on screen or at his big slide show
-- smart 
funny 
quirky 
and outrageously hot ) .
make more film ,
write more book ,
keep the nightmare alive .
