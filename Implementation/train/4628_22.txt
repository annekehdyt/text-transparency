it was by accident
that i was scanning the tv channel
and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human
being who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other .
ethan hawke
( jesse )
`` tape '' '01 and julie delpy
( celine )
`` er '' 94 tv series
( nicole ) .
this gal and guy 
will warm your very heart and soul
and make you think deeply into your past relationship
and how you really wish
you had followed your heart string with a guy or gal
you deep down loved
and lost track of over the year .
jesse and celine have great conversation ,
and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them .
i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004
and if you have viewed this film ,
you will feel the same way .
