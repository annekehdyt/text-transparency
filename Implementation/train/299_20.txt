screwball comedy about romantic mismatch in new york city .
peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the woman in his picture
-- he reveres them --
yet audrey hepburn is ( naturally )
put a notch above the other because 
after all ,
she is the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movie 30 year prior .
he shoots her in loving close-up 
gets right in the sheet between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ben gazzara ,
and allows her room to sparkle throughout .
the love-connection made in the course of the film
are fast and amusing ,
though i did tire of john ritter 's tv-styled klutziness .
colleen camp 
dorothy stratten 
and the grounded 
earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch .
but it is really hepburn 's valentine
and she absolutely glows .
