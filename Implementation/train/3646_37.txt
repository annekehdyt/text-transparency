a light-hearted comedy 
nothing show us a world
that we sometimes wish to escape to :
a world of nothing .
anything you do not like ,
be it a stack of bill 
a bad memory ,
or even hunger can disappear at your wish .
they approached this movie very well ,
and with an enjoyable starring duo 
there were only a few thing
i did not like about nothing ,
and they were not even part of the main movie.first 
the post-credit scene
( and yes ,
there is one ) :
good for a chuckle ,
but what were they trying to accomplish with that ?
i was confused and eager to see a return
to something after a whole movie of nothing .
instead 
we just hear a random assortment of noise
and they scream .
it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion ,
and was not really necessary ,
nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame.second 
the trailer :
i saw the trailer on the dvd ,
and like other have already said this ,
it promotes a horror movie
that never came .
oh well 
poor marketing i guess.if you see this at your movie rental store ,
take a look ,
because nothing is a great movie to watch .
if you have a big screen though ,
you might want to wear shade .
