when i first heard about `` down to earth 
''
i was pretty excited .
i am a pretty big fan a chris rock ,
he was especially hilarious in dogma .
but this film proved to be a disappointment .
chris rock 's performance was not nearly as good as his past performance ,
and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.first off 
chris rock .
he plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine .
obviously 
this works fine in the scene
where he is
supposed to be doing standup ,
but in the rest of the movie 
it does not .
even when he is talking to one other character ,
he seems to think
he is trying to make a roomful of person laugh .
he has a few funny moment ,
but they mostly come during the standup scene
( no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian ) .
as for the rest of the cast 
they are pretty much
there just to give rock someone to talk to 
none of them stand out.also ,
the movie was poorly directed .
the movie has basically a one-joke plot :
old white guy acting like a young black comedian .
while i prefer movie with more than one joke ,
this still could have worked ,
and been quite funny .
the problem was ,
we saw too much of rock
and not enough of the old white guy .
it is supposed to be funny
because it is this white guy telling chris rock 's joke 
but for most of the time 
we just see chris rock ,
so it is not nearly as funny .
the few scene
where they decide to show us the white guy
talking like rock
are 
in fact 
hilarious .
if he had been shown more ,
the movie would have been a lot funnier.overall ,
a few moment of laughter can not make up for the fact
that `` down to earth '' is poorly acted 
and poorly directed .
this one was a pretty big disappointment.rating :
4/10
