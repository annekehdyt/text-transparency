darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetic saleswoman 
with odd ty to elvis presley ,
running into a sea of elvis impersonator
while speaking at convention in nevada ...
and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own .
kim basinger 
a still-attractive actress of considerable merit 
likes to pick quirky movie
to play in ,
but this dreadful screenplay
( by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber )
has not an iota of good humor .
the stereotype and low-ball gag are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy 
but even on a shambling 
shameful level 
the picture is crude and sloppy .
if you do watch ,
see
if you can count how much extraneous shot there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac ,
hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face .
hopefully both she and elvis were well paid .
no star from ****
