it makes the actor in hollyoaks look like the royal shakespeare company .
this movie is jaw dropping
in how appalling it is .
turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action .
i want to find the person responsible for this disaster
and slap them around the face .
i will never get that time back .
never .
how is it possible to create such a banal 
boring and soulless film ?
i could not think of a course of action
that would relieve the tedium .
writing the required ten line is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema .
what more can you say
than reiterate how truly awful the acting is .
please avoid .
