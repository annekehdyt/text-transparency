filmfmy are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film
if they are going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.this film
is set in glasgow
( although only a couple of secondary character have anything approaching a scottish accent ) .
the premise 
about person
who 's life are going nowhere ,
who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hour of the morning
as they have night job ,
could have made for a really funny 
insightful 
quirky 
cultish film .
instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot
which has been so done to bit i am suprised
it has not been banned .
x and y are friend .
x is sleeping with z. y sleep with z as well .
oh you figure
it out.a total waste of time .
painful dialogue -
it sounded like something
that a group of 16 year old would have written for a gcse drama project .
the female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope
that woman would be cajoled
into seeing it.if you are the sort of thicko lad
who laughs at beer advert
and can usually be found wandering round in pack
shouting on saturday night in nondescript town centre
then you will love this film
and find it `` a right laff '' .
everyone else 
run 
do not walk away from this sorry little misfit.and one question ,
when the group left the `` boring '' seaside town
( saltcoat incidentally
although they changed the name on the film ) ,
to go back to glasgow ,
why did
they do it via the forton motorway service at lancaster
which is in england ?
