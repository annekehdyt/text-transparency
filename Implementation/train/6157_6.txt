i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays.the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play.there
is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain
that will keep you guessing
until the final chapter.reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro.last ,
but certainly not least 
is the great directing team of whitney and english .
