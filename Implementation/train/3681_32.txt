after watching this thing ,
then reading the summary on the back of the dvd ,
then thinking back to actual movie ...
.i became a bit dizzy .
i thought ,
maybe i fell asleep
and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never
ending forest
where person drive 11 mile an hour
and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism .
where ( zombie ? )
come out of nowhere
and ( vampire ? )
who
( seduce ? )
pure hearted citizen on their way
to save the world .
neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other .
the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny giroux 's panty off .
coo coo ca fat !
all of them !
maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched
and were too lazy
to change it to its native resolution ,
but that actually made it more entertaining ... in conclusion my trailing thought
thesis had more continuity 
plot 
character development 
antagonism 
subject matter ,
and acting then the entirety of this film .
it made bloodrayne look like citizen f***ing kane
