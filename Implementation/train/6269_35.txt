anchor aweigh is an entertaining mgm musical
that fan of the genre will enjoy
but i would not rate it up there with classic like singin in the rain or the band wagon .
this was the first of three musical
that gene kelly and frank sinatra appeared in together .
kelly and sinatra play joe brady and clarence doolittle 
two sailor on leave in hollywood
who befriend a young boy
( dean stockwell )
who introduces them to his attractive young aunt
( kathryn grayson )
a struggling actress
who is working as an extra at mgm .
though both guy are initially attracted to grayson ,
she eventually voices a preference to joe
but clarence later hooks up with a waitress
( pamela britton )
who ,
he learns is from his hometown of brooklyn .
the paper-thin plot leaves room for several great musical number
including `` we hate to leave '' 
joe and clarence 's lament to their fellow sailor
as they are leaving the ship ; grayson 's torrid rendition of `` jalousie '' ; sinatra 's dreamy rendition of `` i fall in love too easily ''
( a number
which is sadly deleted from some print of this film ) ,
and `` the worry song '' 
a fantasy dance
that kelly does with animated jerry the mouse from tom and jerry fame .
kelly also does a sort of kissing bandit fantasy ballet
which rivals his pirate 's ballet in the later the pirate .
kelly is in peak form here 
in a robust and energetic performance
that earned him his only oscar nomination for best actor and sinatra 's endearingly shy character here
is undeniably sexy .
an entertaining diversion for fan of the mgm musical factory .
