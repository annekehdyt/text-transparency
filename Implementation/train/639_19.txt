i joined this site
to see what comment person would make about this absolute disaster of a film .
i was not drawn in for even a second .
the character were all one-dimensional .
they threw every topic
they could think of hoping something would stick .
i would bet
( and hope )
that everyone
involved in teacher looks back with embarrassment .
there are some great actor here
but you would never know it .
thank god
it did not destroy morgan freeman 's or judd hirsh 's or nick nolte 's or laura dern 's career .
there was no vision 
no labor of love here ,
only a horrible effort gone wrong .
btw i do not think
the writer ever set foot in a real school .
