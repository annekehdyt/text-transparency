gregory peck gives a illiant performance in this film .
the last 15 minute
( or thereabout )
are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch .
the same can not however be said for the rest of the film .
it is not awful and i am sure
it was made with good intention ,
but the only real reason
( if i were to be honest )
to see it is peck .
for the rest you are better off
just reading the old testament .
