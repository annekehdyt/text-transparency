please 
be warned :
this movie 
though a pretty bad storyline 
was one of the most gruesome movie i
have seen ... ever .
just remember
that
before you settle on your sofa
to enjoy the movie.so ,
it officially begins with a party .
just your average party
but there is some guy there .
he is pretty into kate ...
if you know
what i am saying .
memorise his face ;
it will help later.so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney
( did not i say
the plot was bad ? )
and so takes the tube .
that is london underground at the middle of the night ,
but she is just stupid like that .
so the timetable says
the next 
and last 
train will come in 7 minute .
now kate 
dumb party girl
that she is ,
decides that
she can have a nap in the spare 7 minute .
typically 
she misses the train
and finds herself locked in the london underground .
alone .
well 
almost ... so the movie just carries on from there .
blood 
gut 
limb 
even certain part of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed
and eventually amputated from the body.in short ,
it is a typical horror ;
pretty but thick damsel in distress-type woman and sick 
weird psycho .
or as the case may have it ,
creep.i would say
give it a go
if you are into saw 
hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us ,
scream with satisfy out horror need thankyou very much .
