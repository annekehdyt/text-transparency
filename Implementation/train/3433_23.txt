i think
that the shot and lighting were very poor .
when i watched it for the first time i thought
it was the old version
( 1956 ) .
when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked .
i did not know
that there could be such a bad film
made so recently .
that really all i wanted to say .
this film had a good plot though ,
nothing you could not miss out
on if you would simply read the novel
that george orwelll wrote .
all i really want to say
has already been said
except for this : i can not believe
that this film could have possibly received so many award and nominations.i gave this film a one
( awful ) ,
because i felt
that it was very badly made .
well that is all .
so long
