i always tell person
that `` enchanted april '' is an adult movie with no cussing 
no sex 
and no violence .
one might think of it as `` the ultimate chick flick '' ,
but i bet there are one or two enlightened man out there
who love it too .
do not invite the kid 
though .
this movie is very low-key.seeing `` enchanted april '' is a very healing experience .
the sound track and gorgeous scenery 
along with the lady ' gentle manner 
ing
to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-raphaelite painting.lest
anyone think
your truly only watches one kind of movie ,
i will paraphrase a line i
heard once on `` saturday night live ''
and say
that my two favorite movie are `` the deer hunter '' and `` enchanted april '' .
