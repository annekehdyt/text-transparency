there is plenty to appreciate here :
spectacular location and flying sequence ; period costume 
prop and set ; and competent writing and acting .
however ,
to enjoy a drama ,
we need at least one principal
who exhibits some quality
that we can like or admire .
in this bunch of catty snobs 
we found only one character
who is at all likable \u0097 a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim .
from the reviews here 
it is clear that we are completely out of step ,
but we did not find their malicious-schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining .
even the dog is detestable .
we threw in the towel after two of the six episode ,
so you should discount these observation accordingly ,
but what i could find written about this mini-series gave us no cause
to expect character transformation or redemption .
