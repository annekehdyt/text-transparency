i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme ,
found it touching and sensitive .
it is not for someone with a reality-mind
as it is full of fantasy and lovely moment
that sometimes do not make sense .
william russ did a grand job as hank .
i have only seen him in the remake of the long 
hot summer
where he played a weak character .
but in this one 
the expression in his eye throughout ,
as hank considered the thing
that were happening to him ,
was wonderful and tender .
valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role .
and peter falk as max was splendid
and always ought a smile
when he appeared in a number of important scene .
there were many special scene ,
including the one where hank realizes
who max really was in his life .
it is not for everyone ... ..especially those
who are not into 'feel-good ' movie
and this is definitely one !
if you like everything to be perfect and make sense ,
avoid this one .
but i think
it is well-worth re-watching ,
which is why i taped it .
( yes 
some of us still have vcr .
: )
