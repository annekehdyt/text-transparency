rock star :
inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched !
it had some of the greatest rock n ' roll song ever written ,
performed by 15 very talented singers/performer .
it also had ( in my opinion )
the most heart-felt 
feel-good 
surprise ending in all of reality tv .
it actually made me shed tear of happiness for the winner ! ! !
over the 13 week of this televised competition 
the viewing audience got to know
and became familiar with all of the contestant .
after 30-some episode the remaining contestant seemed more like friend
than just some more stranger competing against each other on a reality tv show .
and the fact
that inxs was ,
and still is ,
one of the greatest rock n ' roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension
created by this wonderful reality series .
if you do not have the series recorded ,
rock star :
inxs the dvd is a great alternative .
