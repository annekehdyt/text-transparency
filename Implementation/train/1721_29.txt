i saw this movie at an actual movie theater
( probably the $ 2.00 one )
with my cousin and uncle .
we were around 11 and 12 
i guess ,
and really into scary movie .
i remember being so excited to see it
because my cool uncle let us pick the movie
( and we probably never got to do that again ! )
and sooo disappointed afterward ! !
just boring and not scary .
the only redeeming thing i can remember was corky pigeon from silver spoon ,
and that was not all that great ,
just someone i recognized .
i have seen bad movie
before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst .
this was from what i can recall 
one of the most boring 
non-scary 
waste of our collective $ 6 
and a waste of film .
i have read some of the review
that say
it is worth a watch
and i say ,
`` too each his own '' ,
but i would not even bother .
not even so bad
it is good .
