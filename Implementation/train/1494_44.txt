north africa in the 1930 's .
to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman
looking for meaning to her life and a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith .
they will meet
and passion will be stirred ,
but not even the sand diviner knows
if they will find happiness or sorrow 
here 
in the garden of allah.the plot is pure hokum ,
but the film is still great fun and beautiful
to look at .
marlene dietrich and charle boyer are a superb screen couple .
she is ,
to put it simply 
gorgeous ,
and boyer gives a most effective 
understated performance ,
letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him .
the supporting cast is excellent :
basil rathbone 
in a sympathetic role as a count
who loves the desert ;
joseph schildkraut as a friendly 
talkative guide
( all the `` arabic '' he and other speak in the film is pure gibberish ) ; lucile watson as a gentle mother superior ; alan marshal as an honorable young french officer ; tilly losch as a dangerous dancer ; henry brandon as a comic porter ; john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner ; and magnificent sir c. auey smith as a wise old priest.movie maven will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun ; marcia mae jone and bonitum granville
( peeking over the nun 's shoulder )
as convent girl ;
gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector ;
and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk 
all uncredited.color film of the 1930 's are both rare and lovely
to look at ,
and this movie is no exception
- the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself .
the garden of allah was the first technicolor film
to be shot on location .
yuma 
arizona gave the film maker all the sand dune
they could desire ,
but contaminated drinking water and 135 degree heat
soon had the company in revolt .
when the daily rush showed
boyer 's face had burned a ight tomato red ,
producer david o. selznick finally gave in .
the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage .
