i had quite high hope for this film ,
even though it got a bad review in the paper .
i was extremely tolerant ,
and sat through the entire film .
i felt quite sick by the end.although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema
-- i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen 's 'everything you ever wanted to know about sex 
... ' and michael hanneke 's 'funny game ' --
i found the director ' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting
to drink woman 's milk totally sickening .
and when the film climaxed in an `` orgy '' where the boy drinks both his mother 's milk 
as well as that of the woman
he has been lusting after for the whole film 
i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap
that it is.do not get me wrong ,
i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema 
as well as independently made film ,
so this flick should have pleased me enormously .
avoid this film at all cost ,
it should be relegated to the annal of history as a lesson in bad cinema .
