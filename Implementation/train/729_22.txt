i rated this film 7/10
which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay 
direction and 1944 production value and 6/10 for acting.my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen character
except for that played by heroine ella raine as carol richman
who was excellent at 8/10.also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess
whose character convinces
that
he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson ( alan curtis ) was just in view of his naive alibi.these two then form an alliance to prove scott 's alibi.i have this film on a `` suevia film noir cine negro '' dvd in spanish as `` la dama desconocida '' with the original soundtrack `` ingle '' as an alternative language 
since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version.i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raine after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in `` impact '' playing a sole female garage proprietor.here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestion that she should return to her home in kansas ( her boss 's pet name for her ) before solving the missing alibi.the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her.he had however designed child 's home and playground so i suppose `` family man '' had lit up in carol 's ain.in the 1940s with `` the film code '' in operation ,
producer could only portray sex through metaphor and here
it is done in the form of furious drumming
played by elisha cooke jnr.carol dolls
herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt
to lure the drummer into giving her information about `` the phantom lady '' alibi.the other main character 
jack marlow
( an associate of scott henderson )
is played by franchot tone
whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol 
for instance ,
did not notice him constantly
and strangely admiring his hands.here the screenplay should have been improved
and provided more suspense as these theatrical move telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience .
