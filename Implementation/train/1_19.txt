the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information .
interesting 
entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more .
the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality
that can not be compared to any other short film
that i have seen .
i have rated this film at the highest possible rating .
i also recommend
that it is shown to office manager and business person in any establishment .
what comes out of it is the fact
that person with idea are never listened to ,
their voice is never heard .
it is a lesson to be learned by any office
that wants to go forward .
i hope
that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea ' .
i look forward to viewing the sequence .
once again congrat to halaqah medium
in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind .
