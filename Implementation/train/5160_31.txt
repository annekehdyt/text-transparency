mel gibson 's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film ,
but it left a sour taste in the mouth .
rob roy 
by contrast 
is slightly less polished 
but a better film by far .
this is a historical film
which combines timeless theme with truly historical value ,
whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale .
what makes this film is the cast .
liam neeson plays the hero 
in a role he basically reprised
( in a watered-down fashion )
in the phantom menace .
the character is heroic ,
but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover .
admirable yet human ,
he commands the screen .
against him are set a selection of equally human adversary
including tim roth 's cunningham 
obnoxious but illiant ,
and john hurt 's morally bankrupt laird .
also to praise is jessica lange 
as rob 's pragmatic wife :
also strong and noble ,
but 300 year away from a modern heroine ,
which is only as it should be .
this is not the most original film
you will see ,
but it has the courage of its own conviction ,
and the strong performance make you care .
