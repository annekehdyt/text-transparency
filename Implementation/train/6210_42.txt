i liked the movie 
first of all
because it told an interesting story ,
but the story
as told in the movie
felt like it
was condensed from a much-longer story .
since the book is over 400 page ,
that makes sense .
it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s 
in a fictional south american country 
also a lot to fit into the time available .
i think
it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series
than it turned out as a 140-minute movie.even
though it is rushed ,
the story does not skip so much
that it gets confusing .
what is told is told fairly well .
one fault is that clara 's supernatural power appear inconsistently ;
either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie ,
or they should have been left out .
two more fault
( which could be spoiler ) :
esteban 's eventual return to goodness happen somewhat too suddenly ,
and ferula 's curse seems to wear off ,
even though the tone of the story suggests
that it should endure forever.the acting is excellent .
glenn close 
as the tormented spinster ferula 
is outstanding .
jeremy iron 
as the utal self-made rich man 
is also excellent .
meryl streep 
as the main character clara 
is great ,
although she is often even better
than she was in this movie .
there were many well-performed smaller role too .
the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach ;
each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent .
