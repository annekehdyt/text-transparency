it is boggles the mind
how this movie was nominated for seven oscar
and won one .
not because it is abysmal
or because given the collective credential of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them
but because in every category it was nominated prizzi 's honor disappoint .
some would argue
that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career
but i do not buy it .
only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano 
a dark character study set in mexico ,
that ranks among the finest he ever did .
prizzi 's honor on the other hand 
a film
loaded with star power 
good intention and a decent script ,
proves to be a major letdown.the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigure the quirky crimedy
that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90 's
but the script is too convoluted for its own sake ,
the motivation are off and on the whole the story seems unsure
of what exactly it is trying to be :
a romantic comedy 
a crime drama 
a gangster saga etc .
jack nicholson
( doing a brooklyn accent
that works perfectly for de niro
but sounds unconvincing coming from jack )
and kathleen turner in the leading role seem to be in paycheck mode ,
just going through the motion almost sleepwalking their way through some part .
anjelica huston on the other hand fare better
but her performance is sabotaged by her character 's motivation :
she starts out the victim of her bigot father 's disdain ,
she proves to be supportive to her ex-husband ,
then becomes a vindictive bitch
that wants his head on a plate.the colours of the movie
have a washed-up quality
like it was made in the early 70 's and huston 's direction is as uninteresting as everything else .
there is promise behind the story and perhaps in the hand of a director hungry
to be recognized
it could have been morphed to something better
but what is left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making .
