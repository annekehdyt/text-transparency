pretty bad movie offer nothing new .
the usual creaks and moan attempt to make-up for a muddled 
but thin story .
acting is barely above pathetic .
why liam neeson signed on for this
is anyone 's guess .
owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performance in recent horror-movie history .
catherine zeta jone is fun to look at and not much else
although lili tayor did an above-average job .
the special effect were fairly memorable
and the house itself was eathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous .
however they can not makeup for the poor acting and the storyline
which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute .
do not bother .
