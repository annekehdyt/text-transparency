this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 
with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot
that will make you laugh ... ok ,
it is not really stupid
but it is cheesy fun .
i saw many similarity between this and 'creature with the blue hand '
( aka the bloody dead )
and they do have the same director !
scotland yard 's finest is investigating the murder of young lady at a college .
seems that criminal are being let loose from a local prison
to do the bidding of some evil person
and then returned
when their work is done .
there is a nifty device hidden inside a bible
that squirts prussic acid ,
and there is another device
that is neither nifty nor clandestine ,
it looks like a large squirt gun
and the victim must be pretty near soaked
before they expire .
joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector
and he mostly chews gum
and looks off into the distance .
there is a `` monk '' ,
and how anyone identifies this thing
as a `` monk '' is beyond me ,
it carries a whip and dress in a red outfit with a red hood 
more of a klan member of a different color than a monk .
there is all kind of nifty device like a fireplace hearth
that goes up and down
to admit the monk ,
and it steps right over the fire
without setting his robe alight 
a nifty trick right there .
this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtone ,
and
while it is rather silly at time
it is fun to watch .
7/10 
not bad ... .
