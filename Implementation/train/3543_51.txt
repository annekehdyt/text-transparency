animation always seems to be fringe .
in japan 
this might not be the case ,
but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat `` kid '' tag on it .
france is probably one of the more comic-liberal country 
home of classic as tin-tin 
asterix 
lucky luke 
valereon and so on
( if you have never read these ,
it is not too late .
there is no upper-age limit on them
and they do not carry the nerd-stigma of dc or marvel )
it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france .
it suit my prejudiced image of the french as art-loving 
anti-usa-oriented and talented movie-maker .
luckily there is also `` a scanner darkly '' out there to suppress
that view - seems art is pretty much international.anyway ,
as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french .
if you are a normal person
you will get scared by this .
there is no need for that however !
beneath it is cool ,
sleek cel-shaded appearance
there is a good thriller
and a good movie overall.that was one of my fear for this movie .
it is so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick 
much like sony and c :
o are doing with their pixar rip-off .
i was expecting a confusing 
sometimes boring and not very engaging movie ,
but luckily i was wrong.i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff ,
but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well .
note :
i have seen the french dub
which was ok as far
as i could see .
english might be more interesting what with craig and everything.a final word of praise to the animation .
it was awesome .
futuristic 
well-crafted 
nice camera-work 
smart solution
( eye for example looked very good ,
which is hard to do )
and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out `` this is so damn impressive ! `` .
then again 
i really like animation and i appreciate the effort
the studio put down ,
so my verdict is a bit biased.good movie anyway ,
definitely lives beyond it is `` gimmick '' .
