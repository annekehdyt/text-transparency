i tried restarting the movie twice .
i put it in three machine
to see what was wrong .
did steven seagal 's voice change ?
did he die
during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone
who does not even resemble him ?
or was the sound on the dvd destroyed ?
after about 10 minute 
you finally hear the actor 's real voice .
though throughout most of the film ,
it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom.i
would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill ,
if i owned a copy .
i rented it ,
but i will never do that again .
i will check this database
before renting any more of his movie ,
all of which were ( more or less )
good movie .
you usually knew
what you were getting
when you watched a steven seagal movie .
i guess
that is no more .
