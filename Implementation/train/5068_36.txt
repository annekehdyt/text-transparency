for all its visual delight 
how much better renaissance would have been in live action .
the animation is fantastic in the big picture 
yes ,
but the character are cold and hollow 
much like the story and the style of this film .
with real actor 
perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless .
there is much to admire here ,
but at the end i found
that all i could do was admire .
i did not enjoy the movie
that much ,
and it clarifies something
that i did not see before :
that the visual element can be the defining positive aspect of a film ,
but
without a good story and strong character ,
it can all be for nothing .
i will not go so far as to say
that this movie comes to nothing ,
but sometimes it comes dangerously close .
i love dark sci-fi thriller .
blade runner and dark city are two film i
thought were wonderful .
but blade runner had its tragic villain
and dark city had its thought-provoking story arc .
renaissance has shadow and light 
but little else .
i wish
i could have liked this movie more ,
but the weak story and the empty character stood in the way of that .
the renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life .
how ironic 
then ,
that one of the most bleak and lifeless movie i have seen this year takes its title from the renaissance .
