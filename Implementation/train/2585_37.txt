not only is drew a millionaire ;
but also obnoxious and guilty of being very grandiose .

he grew up in
and offers the family
living there ,
the valco 's 
$ 250,000 to be his `` family '' through the christmas season .
tom valco

is reluctant ,
but is greedy enough
to take drew 's offer .
christine valco

has little to say in the matter ,
but learns to like
having drew around ...
not exactly the same sentiment with daughter alicia

genuine fun is in store
as a happy noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare .

affleck is comedic 
albeit strange .
