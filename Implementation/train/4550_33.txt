`` life hits us in the face ... ...
..we must try to stay beautiful ''
debut movie from one of belgian 's best artist
( he sings song ) ,
tom barman .
a long awaited movie and -- -happy happy joy joy for flemish filmmaking --
-really worth watching 
and a promising piece of work !
it takes us into the lifes of 8 main character
that live through a friday- and night .
the title says
a lot about the way
we spend time with them :
we float
as they do into friday night 's party
where they kinda ' meet.it is rhytmic style is very 'thought off ' .
superb use of music .
it sometime takes the upperhand to the image
and then you feel its power .
gainsbourg !
qotsa !
the party scene
( 20minutes ? ? ? )
is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way
that it is shot .
it keeps you really with it
while it is set in a small place with a lot of person
having a big party ...
..so hard to shoot.thank you menij\u00e8r barman
for making this daring movie in these ,
already some year going 
poor time of flemish filmmaking .
you made my day !
