this was talked about to death by the critic
when it honestly is not that great .
sure 
`` chaos '' and `` inside man '' are literally the same movie 
just with variation in suspense .
but i found `` chaos '' more enjoyable
because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film `` swordfish . ''
the reason
this film is more popular
is because this got released in the state and `` chaos '' was aired all around the world at film festival and foreign theater ,
but has yet to find a distributor in the u.k. and u.s.a.
it is true that this film makes lot of tribute to classic film like dog day afternoon and other spike lee film ,
but that does not mean that it is a pleasant film to watch .
watch it if nothing else is on t.v. ,
but you will probably get bored with after awhile .
