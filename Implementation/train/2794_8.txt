jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen 's most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin .
larry peerce 's direction waver uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy .
robert klein certainly think
it is the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the player in the film .
normally 
i do not like to let myself get so ascerbic ,
but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite book ,
and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .
