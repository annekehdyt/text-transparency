contrary to most other comment about `` syriana '' on the imdb web-site 
i and my family found
watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space.in short ,
this was a film
based on a script
whose writer was being too clever by far .
rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner ,
it was assumed
that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignette of different story-line from a dozen or so `` story-line '' at the audience made for great and clear viewing .
no 
sir 
it does not .
what does make for great viewing is total clarity 
precision 
plot and story-line - and characterisation -
which have a beginning 
a middle ,
and an end.this kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.thank goodness 
then 
for the tv and dvd presentation of the hollywood and british film noir of the 1940s and 1950s whose writer 
director 
and actor knew the value of clear story telling 
diction ,
and acting
that meant something.this is one dvd
that this family will not be sitting through again .
