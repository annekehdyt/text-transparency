a fabulous book about a fox and his family
who does what foxs do .
that being stealing from farm and killing prey .
until a trio of farmer decide
they have had enough of this fox
and try in various way
to have the problem `` solved '' .
they are of course `` out foxed '' at every turn
and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole
the family perform raid against the three farmer land.the '' film '' version ,
and i use the term film very loosely ,
is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movie particularly the ocean movie .
they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely .
so kudos to them .they will make lot of money
and destroy another classic roald dahl child book .
