this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control .
it is exquisite boredom in beautiful picture .
for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shot .
however 
what i found hard to take about the film
was that
although anja sch\u00fcte was about 19
when it was shot the girl
are portrayed as much younger
than they actually are .
this whole lolita thing especially as there is an older man
involved leaves me rather uneasy .
the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area
in order to make her look even younger
than she is .
come on ,
sex is a nice past time- between consenting adult .
another thing i found odd
was that neither beart nor sch\u00fcte have a nude scene in the film 
well 
not a proper one at least .
