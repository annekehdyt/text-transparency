simon pegg plays a rude crude
and often out of control celeity journalist
who is ought from england
to work for a big american magazine .
of course his winning way create all sort of complication .
amusing fact based comedy
that co star kristen dunst
( looking rather grown up ) ,
danny huston 
and jeff bridge .
it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior .
we completely understand
why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw up .
i liked the film .
its not the be all and end all
but it was a nice way
to cap off an evening
of sitting on the couch watching movies.7/10
