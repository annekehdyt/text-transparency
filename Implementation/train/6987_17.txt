the house of the dead was the worst movie i
have ever seen 
between the pathetic 'matrix ' 360 camera angle attemp and the cheesy acting i fell asleep .
i do not think
that the director and set manager could decide
whether it was raining or not ,
because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other .
i would rate this movie a 1/10 ,
( 10 being the best ,
1 being the worst ) .
also jumping scene from the movie to the game was really annoying ,
it makes you wonder
if they were just making up for lose time .
i beg anyone
who reads this ,
not to see it .
it is not worth the time .
