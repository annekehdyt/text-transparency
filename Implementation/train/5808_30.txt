the woman in black is fantastic in all aspect .
it is scary 
suspenseful and so realistic
that you can actually see it happening in real life .
i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 ,
and with all the light off and the volume turned up ,
it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life .
i managed to get hold of a copy ,
and now 
i make sure to ing it out every halloween
and show it too unsuspecting family member ,
who have no idea
what they are in for ,
and all i can do is laugh with glee .
as for the film :
it starts out with a young lawyer
named arthur kipps ,
who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford
to settle the paper of a recently deceased client -
mrs. alice drablow .
this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story .
but then 
arthur attends the funeral 
and from that scene on 
we do not feel safe .
we are constantly on edge and biting our nail ,
and that goes on for the next hour or so 
until the final 
thrilling finale.a warning to all new viewer though :
do not watch this alone ...
