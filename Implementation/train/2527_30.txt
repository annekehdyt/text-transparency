i can not say much about this film .
i think
it speaks for itself
( as do the current rating on here ) .
i rented this about two year ago
and i totally regretted it .
i even /tried/ to like it
by watching it twice ,
but i just could not .
i can safely say
that i have absolutely no desire
to see this waste of time ever ,
ever again .
and i am not one to trash a movie ,
but i truly believe
this was awful .
it was not even funny in the slightest .
the only bit i enjoyed were the few scene with christopher walken in them .
i think
this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me .
all i can think
of when i see one of their film now-a-day is this terrible movie ,
and it reminds me not to waste my money .
amy poehler is so very annoying 
too.overall 
well ,
i think
you get my point .
the star are for walken 
by the way .
