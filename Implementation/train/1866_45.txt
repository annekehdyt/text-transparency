some not-so-spoily spoiler aheadwhy do person ,
when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club ,
cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom ?
who in their right mind would hide under a bed
when someone eaks into their room ?
how often do you knock on a stranger 's door
and when they do not immediately answer ,
you open the door 
walk in 
shout a few hello 's and then start going through their stuff ?
if you were being pursued by someone
you just discovered was a murderer ,
what would you do ?
quietly sneak off
and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implement ?
run 
quietly of course 
to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure ?
i could be talking about almost any thriller
that is come out in the last few year ,
but since this is the `` the return '' page ,
obviously i am talking about `` the return . ''
i saw it free
because i work at a movie theater
and make a point of screening all the `` scary '' movie .
i thought
this one was tolerable ... aside from the well-worn clich\u00e9s .
sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of `` huh ? ''
through most of the film .
the detail of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses
and it is almost enough
to make it interesting
except there was not enough explanation
as it moved on
and so i was almost lost
until the last 2/3 of it.if you are a die-hard thriller fan ,
it is worth seeing at least once .
if there is nothing better at the theater
and you really want to watch a movie 
eh ,
i guess
it is worth a matin\u00e9e ticket .
if you thought
the trailer made it look like an interesting movie
and you can not wait ... wait .
