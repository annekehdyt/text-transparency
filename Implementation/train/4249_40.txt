this is peter falk 's film .
period.i was 10 year old
when this film came out ;
i was already a film maven at the time .
of course neither my parent nor i saw this film
when it came out ,
but i was in love with the typeface of its ad and the aura
that this was an important film .
okay 
34 year later i have finally seen the film
-- having never seen any cassavete-directed film previously .
he is a hack 
overall .
zero sense of timing 
editing .
gena 's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman 's stint in `` rain man '' :
technically on par but entirely one-note .
as tom cruise stole `` rain man 
''
falk takes the cake for this film.i was annoyed with gena 's performance 
really throughout
-- it seemed better suited for `` awakening ''
( blecch ! ) .
it is not all her fault :
she is a basket case from first scene to last .
we never find out why ? ?
but falk 's character seems real and is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man.shave off at least an hour
( an editor needed !
) ,
and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence
but of a simple 
cro-magnon ,
man coming
to grip with a wife
who does not work
and yet can not deal with her three kid
and her husband 's long hour of work.i would rather remember cassavete for `` the dirty dozen '' or `` rosemary 's baby . ''
he would have been a better director
had he snipped his own tendency for excess
-- as he amply demonstrates with this film.bob
