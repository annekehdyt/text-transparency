welcome back kiefer sutherland .
it is been too long
since you have appeared in a movie 
,
and what a movie this was 
was it 24 no 

but very intriguing 
especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent .
kiefer 's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie 

kiefer 's partner 

is eva longoria 

the desperate houswife .
wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good 

i wish
though that kim bassinger had a bigger role 
,
but other than that 
i really think
the whole movie was a blast from start to finish .
this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller ,
everybody played their part to the hilt .
nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie 
,
so as to keep you guessing at all time .
and i really think
that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie 
,
but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day 

thumbs up .
