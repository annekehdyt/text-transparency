like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing
- the 1940s noir film -
but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past .
the term 'neo-noir ' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten year
that it has lost its meaning and its impact .
john dahl 's film on the other hand 
truly deserved to be described as such .
the casting is perfect all around
and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacque tourneur .
the plot is so tight
that you are hooked within the first fifteen minute .
jame m. cain would have appreciated it .
many contemporary film leave me wondering
why
they do not make them like
they used to ,
and i am not even that old .
movie such as red rock west give us hope for the future
while paying tribute to the past .
