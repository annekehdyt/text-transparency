otto preminger ,
completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox ,
reunited his `` laura '' lead for this stark 
gritty detective drama .
dana andrew again portrays a cop ,
but this time he is hardened 
cynical and has been accused of polouse utality by his superior -
`` you do not hate hood ,
you liked to beat them up ! `` .
mark dixon
( andrew )
despises criminal ,
as his own father was a crook .
he does not want to be `` sandy dixon 's kid ''
so he became a polouseman ,
but his method are harsh and hated.one night ,
investigating a murder ,
he unknowingly punches a suspect 
ken paine
( craig steven )
so hard
that it kills him .
a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up ,
intending to frame a hated thug 
scalise
( gary merrill )
for the crime .
however 
the blame fall on paine 's father-in-law 
jiggs taylor
( tom tully ) ,
whose daughter 
department store model morgan taylor
( tierney )
is estranged from her husband
but keeps getting drawn into his gambling scheme .
paine had slapped his wife 
enraging her father ,
who did show up at his son-in-law 's apartment ,

jiggs is arrested and charged.riddled with guilt 
mark fall for morgan and offers money for an attorney .
he decides to take on scalise anyway
but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death ,
confessing everything .
in the end 
he can not live with the knowledge with what he has done ,
and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan .
despite all the tragic circumstance 
morgan professes her love for mark
and will wait for him.it was great
to find this film on dvd 
after so many year of televised obscurity .
eddie mueller 
a film noir historian 
provides the commentary
and does a good job ,
but i find his assertion
that audience would not have caught the significance of the casting of the two lead ,
since `` laura '' had been made six year earlier .
in that respect 
he is mistaken
because they had appeared in `` the iron curtain '' two year prior to wtse
and the film was a box-office success.andrew
and tierney were fabulous together ,
and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha ,
fanning the flame between the detective and the dame.the night cityscape give the film an air of menace .
gary merrill is great as the low-life scalise ,
who had a criminal past with dixon 's dad
( `` your father liked me 
''
he taunts mark ) .
karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also .
and tom tully is just touching
and funny as morgan 's unjustly accused pop.a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast .
