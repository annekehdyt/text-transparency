there are some element
that save this movie from being a total catastrophe ,
but are overshadowed with bad acting ,
plot hole 
deus ex machina thrown in 
stupid dialog 
weak script 
and predictable clich\u00e9s ...
what we have here
is a horror movie with a storyline
that goes nowhere for most of the time .
a group of unlikely hero
including a black guy
that gets it first
( yeah ,
that clich\u00e9 seems to be still very much alive even in finland ) ,
seem to have trouble
trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital .
there are shrieking ghost
( very imaginative ) 
zombie
( at one point i thought at least they did not use zombie ,
but they came ) ,
and finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on ,
getting in their way .
there is also some time-shift doodle present ,
but it adds up nothing to the storyline .
autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation ,
but they never spell it out to the viewer 
or their confused friend .
their line consist only of profound life lesson thought like :
`` what happens will happen ... ''
or `` light can not live in the darkness ... ''
or the ominous `` i need a red crayon ... red crayon . ''
so all this character
( including worried father and sweet doctor in distress type )
end up doing is running around them dark floor 
and from or mistakenly to the demon .
occasionally a ghost or a group of zombie show up ,
and
if it seems a demon keyboardist can not spot a group of six person coming towards it ,
waving a flashlight and conversing ,
it was just pretending .
and apparently this demon can eak through wall
without much hassle ,
but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities.in the end
we even get a `` it was all a dream '' sequence twist .
or maybe it was not .
oh 
boy i wish this movie was ,
and that kind that makes time seem to move faster
so it all plays out in just 10 minute or so ...
