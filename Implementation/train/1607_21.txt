here we have 2 misunderstood kid
who never stood a chance against a cruel 
poverty riddled existence :
robin hood singled out by the police for persecution
because they were a trifle wild at time .
gad !
according to this crap bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the missouri
who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend
who did not really want to hurt anybody ...
.he just wanted thing
without putting a lot of energy
into getting them .
badly acted ,
poorly filmed 
unbelievable dialogue 
unrealistic use of weaponry 
gore
that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing .
avoid this bilgewater .
thumb down .
-5 star .
