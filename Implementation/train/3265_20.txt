kureishi has not exactly been blessed with movie
that justify the quality of his writing .
recent adapted travesty 's like 'intimacy ' have ruined great writing .
but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnation 
eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette .
a middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood
by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter .
the fact
that you believe
all this is credit to the quality of the acting
as it is to the finite gift of the writing .
and in daniel craig we have a strutting 
ash 
gruff anti-hero
who denies the audience to ever question
why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother .
beautifully shot 
the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral character 
but as a study of inconceivable lust ,
it is a winner .
