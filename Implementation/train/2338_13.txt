very bad acting 
and a very shallow story .
not even a decent b-movieevent
that were suposed to be shocking like human geting on board an alien ship
were boring
and very lame.this is one of the worst sci-fi i
have ever seen .
i saw the 5.0 star
and decided to watch it since i like the genre ,
but it sucked so bad.now there is really very few good movie on alien subject ,
i think
because most of them are low budgeti
give it 3/10
