there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie .
which is a prequel to the tv show ,
that is not found everywhere else in life and entertainment .
both before david lynch disgusting style of story telling 
and after .
from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach .
and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaks.to the mind
numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak :
fire come walk with me .
i watched it all just
to make sure
i was not missing anything .
i did not .
it is is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie .
save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else
that at least has the ability
to tell a story ,
rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie.i have heard a lot of review 
rant and rave about how great david lynch .
because of his ability
to define misery and and tragedy
and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing .
this is not life imitating art 
as much
as it is some sick twisted version of art
doing its best
to inspire complete mindless life.do
yourself a favor
and avoid this garbage .
