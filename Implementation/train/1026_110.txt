`` ice age '' is one of the cartoon movie ever
produced by blue sky studio
and released in 2002 as the company 's first .
we are introduced to the main character :
a squirrel named scrat
( voiced by chris wedge ,
and please note :
the sound of scrat 's screams is the sound of tom 's screams from the `` tom and jerry '' cartoon ) ,
a woolly mammoth named manny
( voiced by ray romano of `` everybody loves raymond '' ) ,
a sloth named sid
( voiced by john leguizamo of `` titan a. e. '' ) ,
and a saber toothed tiger named diego
( voiced by denis leary of pixar 's `` a bug 's life '' )
.the movie opens with scrat
trying to bury an acorn and right after that ,
he caused an avalanche .
we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age
( except for manny ,
who is going the other way
looking for other mammoth
that looked like him ) .
sid comes out of his cave yawning ,
and saw
that his family abandoned him .
he then pays toll with some aardvark .
unfortunately 
he gets pursued by sylvia
( voiced by kirsten johnston of `` 3rd rock from the sun '' ) ,
a female orange sloth ,
who wants sid to go migrating with her .
sid eventually teams up with manny ,
and they became friends.meanwhile 
nearby a human tribe 
soto
( voiced by goran visnjic ) ,
an evil saber toothed tiger 
wants revenge against the tribe 's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son 
roshan 
away from him .
in the morning 
he 
diego 
and soto 's henchman 
lenny
( voiced by alan tudyk ) ,
oscar
( voiced by diedrich bader ) ,
and zeke
( voiced by jack black )
attacked the tribe ,
but the leader 's wife escaped with roshan
and gave him to manny and sid to look after .
eventually 
diego joins them ,
and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe ,
who are also looking for him as well .
relax and watch the rest of the movie
and find out 
okay ?
besides manny 
sid 
diego 
scrat 
sylvia 
and roshan 
the supporting character in there
including a pack of wolf
that roshan 's tribe are using ,
and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer
( voiced by jane krakowski ) ,
and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel
( voiced by lorri bagley ) ,
to whom sid shows them roshan
as they relax in a tar pit .
incidentally 
the two rhino 
carl
( voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi 's `` madagascar '' ) ,
and frank
( voiced by stephen root of pixar 's `` finding nemo '' ) ,
who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff ,
are simple minor character .
same went for the dodos ,
who are using melon
as their food supply.the gags in this movie are very funny .
for instance 
manny talk through his trunk saying ,
`` i am not going ! ''
when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit ,
sid ask jennifer `` what do you say
if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ? ''
jennifer then responds to him ,
`` what do you say
if you go jump into the tar pit ! ? ''
rachel also then kicks sid in the waist .
sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his tooth ,
then she ask sid
if he is holding his eath ,
tells diego to eat him ,
and promptly walk off.since `` ice age '' is not only a success ,
but it has 2 sequel :
the first one was `` ice age :
the meltdown '' ,
which was released in 2006 ,
and the other was `` ice age :
dawn of the dinosaurs '' ,
which is going to be releasing next year .
i can hardly die waiting to see what `` ice age :
dawn of the dinosaurs '' will be like .
