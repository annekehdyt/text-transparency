i really liked the first 2 season .
because a lot of good character disappeared later on .
like most show are kinda slow at first then get better in later season ,
but this is the absolute reverse .
jenny from the 1st season and valarie from the 2nd season were saina 's friend ,
i really did not care for the other 
jenny and valarie were her coolest friend .
i think for some reason ,
the producer wanted us to not like her college friend for some reason ,
they were so cruel to saina .
but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown
and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash ,
that is the funniest episode .
i also thought
it was funny
how libby was popular
but she was always jealous of saina ,
and never seemed to have a real boyfriend
but was always wanting to be with harvey .
i just wished
they could have made more better one .
i also liked how the first 2 season 
during the opening credit saina would say a few word
while wearing a costume 
like in the pilot episode
where she is in the witch costume ,
i liked how she said
`` this is so not me ''
and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think ,
but this is a really cool show .
it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way
because it good at first
but once it turned color and barney fife left ,
it was longer good .
but i still like to watch it ,
but the only reason i watch later season is because of saina .
what i meant about the opening sequence is :
the opening title of season 1-3 show saina in front of a mirror
posing with several different costume and outfit
as the cast member ' name quickly flash on the bottom of the screen .
at the end 
saina would say
some sort of pun
that related to the outfit
she is wearing ,
then disappear .
the opening sequence of season four includes the character in bubble .
the opening credit of season 5-7 feature saina at various location around boston
