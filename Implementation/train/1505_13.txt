fairly good romantic comedy
in which i do not think
i have ever seen meg looking any cuter .
all the player did a good job
at keeping this a lively romp .
of course 
in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey ,
but that is why i love romantic comedy ... .one can just totally forget reality
and have a good time .
nice film .
damn 
meg is a babe 
eh ?
