this is the best of shelley duvall 's high-quality `` faerie tale theatre '' series .
the ugly stepsister are oadway-quality comedy relief ,
and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood .
jennifer beal does an excellent job as a straight cinderella 
especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick 's prince charming .
jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well ,
although i am not sure i liked the `` southern lady '' characterization with some of the line .
steve martin 's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin ,
but a tiny bit misplaced in the show 's flow.as is customary with the series ,
there are several wry comment
thrown in for the older child
( ages 15 and up ) .
with a couple of small bump 
the show flows well ,
and they live happily ever after .
child up to age 8 will continue to watch it
after the parent finally get tired of it
-- i found 3 time in one day to be a little too much .
