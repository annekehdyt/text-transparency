when i saw this animation for first time
( i was 15 maybe )
i was really impressed !
it has completely different style
compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more .
tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark ...
the color are not that ... colorous .
the character do not talk much ,
there are no long and boring conversation of this
and that
( like in ghost in the shell )
.with its dark picture 
view of strange beast and sense of magic ,
it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian story 
full of violence and horrendous creator 
enchanted forest and deep cave 
dwelled by dragon 
throll 
ork ... and one mysterious hero
to stop evil ...
