i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival ,
and it is one of the best i have seen this year .
seeing it on a big screen
( and i mean big ,
not one of those tv screen
most cinema have )
with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience ,
as the movie takes over your eye and ears and suck you into the story 
into the picture.the movie presents a set of character ,
which are loosely inter-connected .
their story cross at certain point ,
and the multiplicity of story line reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite film .
but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid ,
which provides the backdrop for the entire movie .
it house the character ,
contains the pavement and road
on which they walk ,
and sets the background atmosphere for all the event ,
all in beautifully filmed scenes.the movie return again and again to certain theme
( shoe 
for instance ) ,
and in essence salazar makes his metaphore more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses .
he combines the view of the city with the shot of the character ,
and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background .
a set of talented actor helps him portrait a wide variety of character .
one excellent example is the scene
in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time .
it might not work on a small screen ,
but it gave me goose bump easily on a big screen.the message of the movie is very positive ,
and accordingly the movie is light and funny at time .
the music along the movie is usually pop 
with a few instrumental piece
( i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day ,
although i seriously doubt
i will )
.all together 
i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling ,
and i am not easily impressed
( you will have to take my word for it ) .
for this and more i give this movie a solid 8/10 .
