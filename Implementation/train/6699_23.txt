not to be confused with lewis teague 's `` alligator ''
( 1980 )
which actually is an excellent film ,
this `` il fiume del grande caimano '' laboriously
ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino
made around the end of the seventy
( including the rather watchable `` l'isola degli uomini pesce '' and the not so good `` la montagna del dio cannibale '' ) .
tracing outrageously the plot of `` jaws '' 
the script fails
at creating any suspense what so ever .
the creature is ludicrous
and its victim are simply despicable .
stelvio cipriani 's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventure of these silly tourist
presented from the very beginning as the obvious item of the reptile 's meal .
no thrill out of this ,
rather laughter actually !
and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny
if the dialog and the appearance of the native were not so obviously inspired by pure racism .
very soon the giggling stop in favor of a sour feeling
witnessing such a patronizing attitude .
we could excuse badly made film and poor fxs 
but not that kind of mentality .
never !
