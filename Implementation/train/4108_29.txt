movie have put me to sleep before ,
but no movie has ever done
that twice ,
so it took me three sitting actually to finish it .
the dialog was bad .
woman spoke stiltedly
and the man were caricature .
and two of the supposedly japanese woman looked chinese ,
had chinese name
and spoke with clearly chinese accent .
i am still trying to figure out
why the emmanthal man were sexually wrapped up with each other .
10 minus 8 1/2 equal a tough choice :
do i give this movie a rating of one ?
or two ? movie have put me to sleep before ,
