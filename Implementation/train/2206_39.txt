frequently voted china 's greatest film ever by chinese critic 
as well as chinese film enthusiast from the outside ,
and 
frankly 
i do not get it at all .
what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable 
blandly directed and acted 
with a complete shrew for a protagonist .
wei wei
( do not laugh )
is that shrew 
a young married woman
who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband
( yu shi )
for the past several year .
it is post wwii ,
and they live with the husband 's teenage sister
( hongmei zhang )
in a dilapidated home with not much money
( the man
had been wealthy
when they married ) .
along comes the husband 's old best friend
( wei li ) ,
who also used to be the wife 's boyfriend
when they were teen .
she considers running away from her husband with this man ,
while the husband pretty much remains oblivious ,
thinking
he may engage his little sister to his friend .
that is the set-up ,
and it does not go anywhere you would not expect it to .
i have actually seen the remake ,
directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian .
it runs a half hour longer ,
and is actually kind of dull 
too ,
but at least it was pretty .
this supposed classic is pretty intolerable .
