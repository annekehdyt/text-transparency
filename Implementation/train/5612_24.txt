without peter ustinov and maggie smith ,
this could easily have been a turkey .
but they are illiant .
ustinov is at his best ,
and for fan of maggie 
it is great to see her in her early day ,
matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing .
for englishman in their fifty
( and i am in that acket ) ,
it is always entertaining to see glimpse of and hear sound of the swinging sixty ,
and
although this film spends a lot of time in office ,
it has plenty of sixty nostalgium ,
including red bus 
carnaby street 
a song by lulu and a delicious shot up the micro-skirt of a waitress ,
the like of which england has never seen since in public place .
as an i.t .
engineer 
i know
that the computer hacking trick are laughable ,
but they are not meant to be taken seriously .
nor are the wonderful stereotype of italian 
french and german .
