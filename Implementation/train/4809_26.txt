a little girl 's dead body is found stripped of all possible
mean of identification .
when it is discovered
that one leg is longer than the other ,
it is assumed to be the body of a couple 's missing daughter .
after this trauma 
the couple separate and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizer
and leads a miserable existence .
all of this change
when one day 
many year later 
she receives a phone call from her daughter !
with the help of an ex-cop and a reporter 
she sets out on a journey
to determine
if her daughter is indeed alive .
`` los sin nome '' is a mess plot-wise ,
move at an achingly slow pace ,
and is completely unscary .
the saving grace is emma vilarasau ,
who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother .
the best part of the movie is the ending ,
but i am not sure
it is worth enduring the rest of the film .
beware of the english subtitle on the recent r1 release
-- they are not very accurate .
