did anyone edit this film ?
or was it only the dvd release
that had huge thirty second gap between scene ?
it is ok though ,
i fell asleep
watching it the first time .
then i fell asleep the second time and the third time .
the plot is actually not the worst i have seen ,
but it is close .
the acting is not the worst i have seen either ...
but it is close .
the production ... . well 
i can honestly say
that it was the worst i
had ever seen in my life !
not trying to be spiteful ,
but unhinged could have used some more production.please do not think
i am a hater of horror film ,
or even that i did not enjoy this film .
i just felt
i was laughing at the film much
more than i felt i was laughing along with it .
the gruesome moment were not too poorly done ,
but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.character seemed awkwardly developed 
or ignored all together ,
twist ending was pretty bad ,
and the exposition took forever
without exposing much.i would recommend avoiding this movie.1/10
