camille 2000 aspect ratio :
2.35:1
( panavision )
sound format :
monowhilst visiting rome 
an amorous nobleman
( nino castelnuovo )
falls in love with a beautiful young libertine
( daniele gaubert ) ,
but their unlikely romance is opposed by castelnuovo 's wealthy father
( massimo serato ) ,
and fate deal a tragic blow ... a sexed-up love story for the swinging sixty ,
adapted from a literary source
( alexandre dumas ' 'la dame aux camelias ' )
by screenwriter michael deforrest ,
and directed with freewheeling flair by radley metzger
who 
along with the like of russ meyer and joe sarno 
is credited with redefining the parameter of 'adult ' cinema throughout the 1960 's and 70 's .
using the scope format for the last time in his career ,
metzger 's exploration of 'la dolce vita ' is rich in visual excess
( note the emphasis on reflective surface 
for example ) ,
though the film 's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standard .
production value are handsome throughout ,
and the performance are engaging and humane
( castelnuovo and gaubert are particularly memorable ) ,
despite weak post-sync dubbing .
though set in an unspecified future ,
enrico sabbatini 's wacked-out set design locate the movie firmly within its period ,
and piero piccioni 's 'wah-wah ' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotee .
ultimately 
camille 2000 is an acquired taste ,
but fan of this director 's elegant softcore erotica will not be disappointed .
next up for metzger was the lickerish quartet
( 1970 ) ,
which many consider his best film .
