i have been a fan of this movie for year and year .
because of teri hatcher move into the forefront ,
i had to take the movie off the shelf
and watch it .
why person back in 1991 did not see
how wonderful this movie was in beyond me ?
sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous .
although i never have watching daytime soap operas 
this movie kills me every time i watch it .
the acting is second to none for a comedy
and the writing is so smart .
i highly recommend
that you watch this if you have not already .
you will get to see elizabeth shue 
whoopi goldberg 
teri hatcher 
and carrie fisher ...
to name a few ...
all give splendid performance .
