dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise :
a young mafia would-to-be killer
( chandler )
must demonstrate to his boss
that he is a good man for the service
so he goes to california
to take some lesson with a very known professional killer
( beluschi ) .
first and most important task :
to kill a young woman
( lee )
that is a completely strange for all of them .
but is she a easy target ?
the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea
but the result is just bad routine ;
even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie .
good performance by chandler .
i give this a 4
( four ) .
