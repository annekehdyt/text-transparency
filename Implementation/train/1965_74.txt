cosimo
( luis guzman )
ends up in prison for car burglary
and there
he is given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison ;
so he has to get out of jail 
fast .
he tells his girlfriend rosalind
( patricia clarkson )
to find a man
who will do his time in prison for some money .
but no one wants to do the time for cosimo 's crime
and yet everybody seems to know a guy
who will do that .
soon bad boxer pero mahalovic
( sam rockwell )
founds out the detail of this
so called `` perfect job '' .first of all ,
i think
this movie was very funny
and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone .
this movie is remake of italian comedy `` i soliti ignoti '' .
i did not watch the italian original
so i can not judge or compare those two movie .
but `` welcome to collinwood '' is great comedy for itself ,
about four person trying to rob the money from the vault in one house .
everyone gave their part of illiance from this movie cast .
really excellent movie for these actor :
sam rockwell 
william h. macy
( great ) ,
isaiah washington 
michael jeter
( great ) ,
luis guzm\u00e1n 
patricia clarkson 
jennifer esposito
and finally george clooney gave their share in this project .
maybe to say
that this movie is only comedy ,
is not fair .
this is more then that .
because of one difference .
all of thieve in this movie have very small wish
when they are asked :
what will they do with their money ?
it is mostly securing their future in very humble way .
this fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminal .
and not only them but also cop babitch ,
who is presented like corrupted one ;
so here director russo present us fact
that criminal and cop are the same .
actually all in collinwood are ;
and not only in collinwood ,
cause all person chase money 
on legal or illegal way .
i do not like all movie were audience eventually likes and cheer for thieve .
but 
this one is exception .
you have to love them all .
riley with his little baby and wife in jail .
toto with his pant .
cosimo with his line :
`` your mother 's a whore ! ''
and all other .
they are just like character in my favorite comic 
alan ford .
they all trying to make some money ,
but simply they are out of luck .
but they all did one good deed :
they gave money to riley ,
so he can get his wife out of prison .
they are all hero in my eye ,
cause lot of `` honest '' person would not do that .
