katherine heigl 
marley shelton 
denise richard 
david boreanaz .
even before i knew
what this film was about ,
these name were enough
to draw me in .
gorgeous 
talented and popular 
these are performer to look out for.ok ,
where do i start .
we already know
what the film is about .
five beautiful girl
being targeted by a 'romantic ' serial slasher 
a guy
they all turned down at the school dance 13 year ago .
his trademark include subtle deaththreat disguised as valentine card 
maggot-infested chocolate and a bleeding nose .
his weapon of choice :
well 
take a pick - axe 
knife 
electric powerdrill 
bow and arrow 
hot iron 
etc .
ok ,
so basically it is a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.horror movie
are not supposed to be shakespeare ,
but i am not gon na go there .
i love horror movie 
but not all of them .
this one 
i adore .
it is up there with some of my other favorite .
it is funny 
sexy and scary .
the killer 's mask is childishly creepy ,
and seeing cupid firing a bow
and arrow at a victim is really freaky .
the acting is topnotch :
denise richard 
marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun .
i really did wish to see much 
much more of katherine heigl .
i am one of her biggest fan
and would love to see her doing some leading work soon .
jessica capshaw is a very capable actress ,
and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role
she perfected in urban legend 2.
the smaller part were also good ;
hedy buress was a hoot
( 'bleedmedry.com ' )
and that younger version of denise richard looked frightfully like her.highlight :
every death scene had a particular distinction to it .
the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue .
the hottub scene ,
while ludicrous 
was well done .
and the audiovisual maze was sinister .
the soundtrack is great 
with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.lowpoint :
i felt
as though the killer was not featured enough ,
we barely saw the mask ,
and it was not featured at all during the climax .
i also thought
the climax was really unfocused ,
but fun nonetheless.the twist at the end was not that big of a surprise 
but i am really glad that the filmmaker decided to spare us
that whole 'explaining killer ' routine.i do not like to tell person
which movie they should see ,
but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie
that i thought was really worth seeing ,
then valentine would be it.my rating :
10/10
( bullseye ! )
