very outdated film with awful 
clich\u00e9-ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction .
in addition 
cassavete and falk overact constantly .
a pseudo `` good movie '' .
it takes no time
to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is .
the first scene is a total bore ,
filled with histrionic and hysteric exchange .
the sound is horrible .
camera movement are without imagination as is the building of character .
no poetry 
no subtle psychology 
no interesting shot .
the actor smoke constantly
and we see ad for beer beverage .
very cheap 
indeed .
( one exception :
ned beattie '' s nice and simple way
of playing the hit man ) .
