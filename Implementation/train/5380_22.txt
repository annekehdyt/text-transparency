this is arguably the worst film i
have ever seen ,
and i have quite an appetite for awful
( and good ) movie .
it could
( just )
have managed a kind of adolescent humour
if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek
-- \u00e0 la rocky horror picture show ,
which was really very funny .
other movie 
like plan nine from outer space ,
manage to be funny while
( apparently )
trying to be serious .
as to the acting ,
it looks like they rounded up ain-dead teenager
and asked them to ad-lib the whole production .
compared to them ,
tom cruise looks like alec guinness .
there was one decent interpretation
-- that of the older ghoul-busting oad on the motorcycle .
