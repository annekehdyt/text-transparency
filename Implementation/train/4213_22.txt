i recently saw i.q .
and even though i am not a romantic comedy type of gal ,
i think
that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch .
so many movie in my opinion lack honesty .
you know
that feeling
when you are watching a movie
and you just feel robbed
because it is taking something from the story
and it was like the director
just threw
it together like it was trash ?
the story between the scientist is a sweet and funny one .
how they stuck together
and they tried to help tim robbin character become smart .
i liked the love story between tim and meg
because it was simple
and ought up a good point
when it comes to love ,
`` nothing is what it seems '' .
i would recommend this for a sunday morning.7/10
