having watched this
after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 ,
i came here to pan it
-- but after reading the other comment ,
i have not the heart .
clearly this is a film
that has worked very well for child of a certain age .
well 
let me not be a complete grinch ;
it might still work for some child
-- if they are not too media-saturated
and have not become visually over-sophisticated 
e.g .
from watching all of lotr and harry potter .
but if you are an adult ,
stay mile away ;
you will not enjoy it.the good bit :
barbara kellerman as the witch 
especially in her early scene with edmund 
creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness .
( at the stone table she goes a bit over the top . )
michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s. perry
as mr. tumnus also have the kind of polished ,
skillful acting
we 'd expect from the very best bbc dramas .
and the aslan costume work very well ,
amazingly well considering .
they got the eye just right.the bad bit :
almost everything else 
but two area in particular .
one 
the casting .
england is crammed with good actor and contain ten of thousand of attractive british school kid .
how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiff ?
they move like wooden soldier and speak about as well .
peter has no gravitas or charisma
( and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger sibling ) ;
edmund is just whiny ;
and lucy ... sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically 
visibly 
drastically wrong for this part
that i can not imagine how she got the job.two 
the animal costume .
again 
it appears that they worked for some kid .
if the kid are still at a level
where big bird and elmo are exciting 
believable character ,
they might be entranced by this film .
but to a viewer with the sophistication of 
say 
a 12-year-old
who 's seen prisoner of azkaban ?
when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree ,
there will be hoot of cruel 
derisive laughter .
the costume just do not work
-- i could not ,
and i think
any adult or modern teen could not ,
suspend disbelief
when looking at mister beaver .
the drawn animation later
( gryphon 
etc . )
work better 
is easier to take.so :
ten star for the very young and tender of soul ;
everyone else read ,
or re-read the book and watch the far better film
that unrolls in your imagination .
