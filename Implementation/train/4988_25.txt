1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4/10
( dir-sydney pollack ) :
-dvd version i watched titled `` 3 day of the condor '' -
so so cia drama full of laid-back performance
making for a very laid-back movie .
the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 member of a cia research group
being killed with robert redford 's character 
codename = condor ,
being the one
that was left .
who killed them and why ?
that is what redford tries to find out
while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time .
along the way 
he gets faye dunaway 's character involved involved ,
originally because he needs a place to hide ,
and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey-dovey time .
this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run story
but this one does not have a lot of suspense .
the flat performance do not help
and the finish does not seal the deal for the audience enough either .
despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performer ,
the story and the performance are not what
they should be
and therefore the movie is not what it should be .
