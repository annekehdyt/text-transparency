i know i am in the minority ,
but ... uwe boll is about as talented as a frog .
not even a toad ;
just a frog .
he is reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hack
who churn out one useless crap-fest after another .
this movie ?
is a crap-fest .
slater 's talent is only minimally utilized leading one
to believe
he is got other thing
( like his failed relationship )
on his mind .
reid perform
as if she has either forgotten her acting lesson ,
been severely hit on the head
and made to forget her acting lesson ,
or has one of the worst director in the history of film .
i am voting on the third choice 
myself ,
although the other two are always possible .
uwe boll has never done a single thing
from which i have derived even the slightest pleasure .
frankly 
i am satisfied
that he made this stinker .
i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with `` underworld :
evolution '' for ticket sale .
now 
i am confident
that len wiseman has nothing ,
and i mean nothing ,
to worry about.this rate a 1.0/10 rating for this messy 
convoluted crap-fest 
from ... the fiend : .
