and how many actor can he get to stand in for his own neurotic 
compulsive uber-new yorker persona ?
in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation
than the one kenneth branagh did in `` celeity . ''
it is an annoyingly repetitive story now :
nebbishy 
neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend fall madly in love with a shiksa queen upon
which he project all manner of perfection .
everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartment in great manhattan neighborhood ,
everyone constantly patronizes expensive 
exclusive restaurant
during which all the character relate fascinating anecdote and discuss arcane philosophy ,
there is always a trip to the hampton
during
which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to disease ,
and then of course 
said
main character feel guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway 
sometimes succeeding 
sometimes failing 
etc.this a tired formula ,
and proof
that allen is not really a great film artist at all .
he just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotion of a 20-year-old
who is intent upon telling the same boring old story again and again .
