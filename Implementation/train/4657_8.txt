if you like `` othello 
''
you will love this flick
since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play.the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winter as the woman in colman 's life
while edmond o'brien plays the enterprising press agent.a couple of the supporting player i particularly liked were millard mitchell as the grizzled reporter
who finds an angle and joe sawyer ,
the 1940 's answer to drew carey ,
who plays the cop on the case.great raw moment in this one with noir realism throughout .
