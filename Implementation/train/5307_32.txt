ok 
this movie starts out like a cheesy lifetime movie
and does not get better till almost well through the movie .
the script is full of 'cheese ' and 'fluff '
and cast is not well directed for the most part .
for the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerve .
i do not think
this is one of her best acting job .
the only reason
i bought the movie
is because it was on sale
and had ellen burstyn in it .
she is terrific
but this is also not one of her best acting gigs .
the story is based on true event
and that helps the movie .
actually 
i did not even like the movie at first
and was getting disgusted
when i saw still of the balloon traveling ,
i mean..let it get
where it is suppose to go
and be done with it !
but all is forgiven by the time
it does reach
it is destination
and the story comes to a close .
if this does not ing a tear
to your eye ,
nothing will !
it is cheesy and predictable
but also makes you feel good about the world again .
