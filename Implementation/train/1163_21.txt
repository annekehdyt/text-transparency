this movie seemed like it was going to be better
than it ended up being .
the cinematography is good ,
the acting seemed solid 
the dialogue was not too stiff ...
but then about twenty minute in there is this long scene with a doctor
who you
know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending
to be a doctor -
and it just goes south from there.on top of that ,
the demon is about the silliest
looking hellspawn
since the godzilla-looking thing in curse of the demon .
there is also some odd demon worshipper
who wear mask
that look like the exploding teen from the beginning of logan 's run.in the end ,
the cinematography could not save this movie .
despite some pretty solid performance by the actor ,
the story just does not go anywhere .
i think
`` hellbored '' would have been a better title for this .
