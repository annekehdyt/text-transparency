a remarkable documantary about the landmark achievemant of the woman lawyer association
( wla )
of kumba 
in southwest cameroon 
in legally safeguarding the right of woman and child from act of domestic violence .
in this muslim culture 
where man have always been sovereign over woman ,
according to sharia law ,
one can well imagine the difficulty
of imposing secular legal right for woman and child .
after 17 year of failed effort 
leader of the wla began recently to score a few win ,
and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories.the leader of this legal reform movemant are vera ngassa 
a state prosecutor 
and beatrice ntuba 
a senior judge
( court president ) .
both play themselves in this film ,
which may contain footage shot spontaneously ,
though i imagine much of it 
if not all 
consist of subsequent recreation of real event for the camera .
four case are reviewed ,
and all of the plaintiff also play themselves in the film.two case
involve repeated wife beating 
with forcible sex in one case ;
another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl ;
and yet another concern the repeated beating of a child 
age 8 
by an aunt .
one of the beaten wife also is seeking a divorce .
we follow the case from the investigation of complaint to the outcome of the trial .
the outcome in each case are favorable to the woman and child .
the perpetrator receive stiff prison term and/or fine ;
the divorce is granted.the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates
that these female criminal justice official are indeed gender-neutral
when it comes to enforcing the law .
also noteworthy is the respect
with which all party ,
including those found guilty ,
are treated .
this is a highly important and well made film .
( of interest is the fact
that one of the director 
ms. longinotto 
also co-directed the 1998 film 
divorce 
iranian style ,
which dealt with related theme in tehran . )
( in oken english with english subtitle ) .
my grade :
b+ 8/10
