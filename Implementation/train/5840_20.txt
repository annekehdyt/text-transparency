what a muddled mess .
i saw this with a friend a while ago
and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonder of cinema ,
but this sure is not one of them.while there
very well could be some good ideas/concept
and there are certainly some good performance
( under the circumstance ) ,
it is all buried under random nonsense .
sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killer 
u turn and similar film
as far as the editing is concerned ,
or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration .
say
what you want about david lynch ,
but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness.his quote of stating
that he made the film
as a joke says
it all .
it is not worth your money 
bandwidth or time .
