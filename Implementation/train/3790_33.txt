the man can slaver over lollo ,
if they like ( or her lollos
-- she gave her name to a slang term for east in french ) ,
but the lady have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe ,
who is not only beautiful
but can act .
do not be deterred
if your version has no subtitle
because in this simple 
dashing story of love and war ,
in which all is fair ,
they are not needed .
all you need know
is that 
at the beginning of the film 
lolloigida reads philipe 's palm and tells him
he will marry the daughter of the king .
thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gesture and the running 
jumping 
and swordplay.on the minus side 
the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying ,
and it is annoying
that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood
to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunt .
and of course the non-french-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la 
such as :
virtuous girl :
i must tell you
that my heart belongs to fanfan .
seducer :
my dear 
what made you think
i was interested in that bagatelle ?
