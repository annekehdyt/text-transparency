i love anthony hopkin as an actor so i was very interested to see
how he would do as a writer/director .
i could not have been more disappointed by this move .
the movie was so disjointed
and the cinematography was so over done to the point i
wanted to pull the plug out of the wall .
the actor were very good
but it was such a waste of talent .
not all actor are cut out to be writer or director
and clearly mr. hopkin falls into this category .
of all the movie i have ever seen in my 50 year ,
this is absolutely the worst movie ever .
please do us all a favor mr. hopkin
and stick to acting ,
which you are excellent at ,
and leave the writing
and directing to those who are talented in those area .
if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would .
