although there were some amusing moment ,
i thought
the movie was pretty lame .
the longer it ran ,
the worse it got .
once the action entered monument valley ,
i found myself watching the magnificent outcropping more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the character.the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent .
first she is in on the deal ,
then discovers the truth and she bails .
then she is back again ,
then deserts them again .
then she is back again .
there is no apparent motivation for any of her decision .
there were interesting character 
some interesting scene 
and many missed possibility .
i would have to say
the picture was much less than the sum of its part .
apparently the person
who liked repo man
were inclined to like this one .
searcher 2.0 is no match for the searcher .
