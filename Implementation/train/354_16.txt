no need to detail
what other have written in other review - here goes the summary :
* much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous -
the color are superb -
would love to have it done in silk
as a necktie* the story and execution is a total snooze -
it was quite difficult to stay awake at timesif
you are a student of the fine art 
medieval calligraphy 
early religion
and so forth - have at it .
this is a film for you.if
you want an engaging 
entertaining movie -
look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything
other than an artistic statement.viking did not have horn by the way ...
