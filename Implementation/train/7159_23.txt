my favorite `` imperialism '' movie and one of the best action-adventure flick of all time .
grant 
mclaglen and fairbank dominate the screen with daring-do and wise crack to please all but the most `` pc '' of film goer .
memorable scene abound
-- the 3 sergeant and their 20 sepoy fighting off hundred of thug ;
macchesney and cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch
( `` save some for the elephant '' ) ;
cutter to macchesney
-- `` i am an expedition '' ;
din eaking cutter out of jail 
with a fork
( `` what do you think
i am trying to eak out of ?
a bleedin ' pudding ? ! )
and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing 
bold as ass
-- `` all right 
you are all under arrest !
`` i could go on ,
but suffice it to say i try to catch this film
whenever it is on .
for armchair adventurer and general 
it is hard to imagine a better 2 hour .
