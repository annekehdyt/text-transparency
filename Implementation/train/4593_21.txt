in the first one it was mainly giant rat ,
but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too .
this one 
however 
is just giant rat period ,
well giant rat and one really growing little boy .
this one is about this growing boy and a scientist
that is trying to help him so
he accidentally creates giant killer rat ...
you know
how it is .
this movie has some kill and its moment ,
but i find it to be on par with the original ,
i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movie .
well ,
that is not true ... i actually like `` empire of the ant '' ,
maybe i just do not care for giant rodent .
all in all a rather drab movie
though it does have one rather odd turn of event in this one dream sequence
that is truly bizarre .
i just can not recommend this one .
