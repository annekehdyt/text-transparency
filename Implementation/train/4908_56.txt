this movie has always been a favorite of mine
since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962
when it was shown on a los angeles television station 's `` late show '' .
the character are very engaging from the start of the picture ,
and it is too bad
that the movie has never been released for video tape ,
nor is it ever shown on television
( apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart 
the playwright/producer/director
who wrote the story and first presented
it on the new york stage during wwii
-- the reason
for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 year
after it was made ) .
i did not see the movie again for over 30 year ,
when someone
who had actually been a major cast member of the movie
was able to get me a `` bootlegged '' copy on vhs
( poor video quality 
but good audio ) .
my memory of it was correct :
it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch .
an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its star ,
just starting out in their career at the time 1944 ) ,
went on to became either major motion picture star or at least well-known and fully-employed actor
( e.g .
judy holliday 
edmond o'brien 
jeanne crain 
barry nelson 
don taylor 
karl malden 
peter lind hayes 
george `` superman '' ) reeves 
red button 
lee j. cobb 
kevin mccarthy 
and gary merrill ) .
the scene with the b-24 liberator are terrific ,
especially the close-up shot where the detail of the giant
( for those time )
4-engine bomber
( then 18,000+ manufactured ,
now nearly extinct )
can be seen .
good insight into the different level of training
that a pilot-cadet went through on his way
to being assigned to a bomber crew
( of course 
very gender-biased
as was the trend of the day :
only the man became pilot 
the woman just supported them in their role
-- hardly acceptable in today 's world ) .
i hope someday
it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .
