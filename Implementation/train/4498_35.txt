this is one of the worst-written movie i have ever had to sit through.the story 's nothing new
-- but it is a cartoon 
so
who cares ,
as long as it is pretty and fun ?
i am not going to go as deep as the characterisation ,
or i will be here all day
( except to say
that there are not any ;
the character change personality whenever it is convenient to the plot ) ,
but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper .
thumb down ?
i would vote to cut their thumb off .
`` narrow in on an object/prop .
cut back to character close-up .
character gives a knowing look ,
which the audience will not even remotely understand .
repeat that several time 
with different objects/prop .
`` `` make the character pay no attention at all the huge lump of rock are floating around ,
crashing into each other 
generally raining destruction all over ,
and which could kill them all at any moment
-- but make them stop and gasp in fear
when they see a harmless-looking ,
almost pastoral green rock in the distance . ''
the whole thing is a long succession of event 
action 
and behaviour
that are only there for the convenience of the writer ,
to save him having to think or make any effort at all
to write the story properly.this is the plan 9 of cg cartoon ,
except that it does not have ed wood groan factor
to make it fun to watch.do yourselves a favour :
spend your cartoon budget on pixar movie .
