i can remember this movie
from when i was a small child ,
i loved it then
and i still do now .
i managed to get it on dvd for my 18th birthday and was over joyed
because i had found
it so difficult to find it previously
and it had only be rented
when i was younger .
my favourite character is charlie
because he learns to be a good dog .
the movie is filled with fun song and music .
the animation is illiant
and the character voice are perfect .
this movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think
that if i had not seen the movie
when i was small then i would not find it as illiant and fascinating as i do
although i still believe
that i would still like it
because i am really into animated movie .
