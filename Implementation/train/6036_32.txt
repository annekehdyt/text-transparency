an incredible little english film for so many reason .
first it is a rare look a laurence olivier in a light comedy .
while his performance is not up the standard
he would latter set as one of the greatest actor of the 20th century ,
he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister .
historically this film is of great interest
because of both where
and when it was shoot .
being english
it did not have the big budget of the hollywood film of the same era
and it often shows ,
but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an england
that would soon be gone .
when we watch it today
we think
in term of modern morality and over look the fact
that this movie and its closest american counter part `it happened one night '
were in their day
as risqu\u00e9 as `fatal instinct ' was in our time .
but after watching and enjoying this movie
the first time i can not help but feel sadness
when i watch it today .
with half of film shoot
before 1950 gone 
saving the remaining film means hard choice ,
and unfortunately film like this are often passed over to save movie
that we all consider important .
the color shifting 
lack of contrast 
and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is hearteaking .
this movie along with `it happened one night ' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch 
or better yet why not a double feature .
