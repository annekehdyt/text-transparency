despite unfortunately thinking itself to be ( a ) intelligent ,
( b )
important and ( c )
interesting 
fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly .
the script makes little sense ,
the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main character is strangely trite ,
and john lydon shows us all 
in the space of one movie ,
why
he should never have let himself out of music .
his performance is one-note and irritating.the only positive thing to be said
is that harvey keitel manage to deliver a good turn .
his later bad lieutenant would show
just how badly good actor can act ,
but mercifully his performance here is restrained .
