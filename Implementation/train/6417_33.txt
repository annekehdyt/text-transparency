( spoiler )
the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner 's henna rinse 
one of the worst dye job ever .
that 
and the magnificent caterpillar eyeow on the old evil dude
who was trying to steal steiner 's invention .
mst3k does an admirable job
of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.i particularly like it
when crow kills mike with his 'touch of death ' ,
and
when he revives him in the theatre ,
mike cry `` guy 
i died ,
i saw eternal truth and beauty !
oh 
it is this movie ... ''
that would be a letdown ,
having to come back from the afterlife
to watch the rest of the projected man .
the film could make a fortune
being sold as a sleep aide .
some of the pun in the film were wicked :
polouse inspector- '' electrocution ! ''
crow- '' shocking 
is not it ? ''
polouse inspector- ''
that is lowe ,
all right '' tom servo- '' very low ,
right down by the floor ! ''
polouse inspector- '' can i get on ? ''
tom servo- '' he is dead ,
but knock yourself out '' mst3k is definitely the only way
to watch this snoozer .
