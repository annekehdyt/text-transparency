if you are wondering
where many of the conspiracy theory and paranoid idea about the the un 
israel 
and international affair come from ,
look no further.this is not a supernatural hollywood film loosely
based on some biblical passage .
instead 
this movie was made by a company
( cloud ten picture )
with a political and religious agenda .
as a movie 
the end result at time more look like clip out of a televangelism program
( complete with family prayer and light eaking through church window
while harp are playing )
.for mainstream viewer ,
it may be hard to believe ,
but many person believe in this stuff literally ,
as presented in the movie .
and that 
perhaps 
makes the movie important .
you probably will not find a more concise exposition of the bizarre view of a significan not number of your fellow citizen .
so ,
if you view it ,
view it as a social/cultural document .
if you are at all medium savvy ,
you do not need to be warned about the unsubtle attempt at propaganda and manipulation in the movie .
