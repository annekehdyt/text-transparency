perhaps because i was so young 
innocent and brainwashed
when i saw it ,
this movie was the cause of many sleepless night for me .
i have not seen it
since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school ,
so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now .
however 
i will say
that it left an impression on me ... and most of my friend .
it did serve its purpose ,
at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze
and create our own opinion .
i was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture christian had to endure
when not receiving the mark of the beast .
i do not want to spoil the movie for those
who have not seen
it so i will not mention detail of the scene ,
but i can still picture them in my head ...
and it is been 19 year .
