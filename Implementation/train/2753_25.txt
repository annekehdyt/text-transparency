a scientist
( john carradine
-- sadly )
finds out how to ing the dead back to life .
however they come back with faces of marble .
eventually this all leads to disaster.boring 
totally predictable 1940s outing .
this scared me silly
when i was a kid
but just bore me now .
i had to struggle to stay awake !
with one exception 
the acting is horrible .
such expressionless boring actor !
hopeless.there are some good thing about this :
carradine ,
despite the script ,
actually gives a very good performance .
and there are a few mildly creepy moment
involving a ghost of a great dane walking through wall .
there is also one of the worst-looking knockout in cinema history .
still 
none of this is fun enough
to sit through this .
avoid .
