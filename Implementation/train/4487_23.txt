i saw this in the early 70
( when i was 16 ) ,
and despite the long slow set-up 
meeting 
riot 
etc ,
once the desert section began all fell into context
and i loved it .
( still do ,
it has aged very well . )
back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority .
all criticism seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative .
happily i am no longer in such a minority .
it deftly shows
( in a somewhat prophetic way )
the political splintering 
unrest 
confrontation 
utal repression 
commercialisation and deception
which lay ahead.appreciation for this magistral film
has grown ,
and i am glad about that .
