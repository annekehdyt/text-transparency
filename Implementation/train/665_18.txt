i have seen this movie
after watching paltrow 's version .
i have found
that one a very good one 
and i thought
this would not be as good ...
but i was wrong :
british version was far better and enjoyable !
i found jeremy northam more `` agreeable '' than mark strong ,
but i can say
that strong catch much better austen 's knightley .
anyway 
both version are good ,
but anyone that loved austen 's book ,
should watch this movie .
i agree with *caalling* :
andrew davy changed a few thing ,
but still remains faithful to the original.10/10my 2 cent !
