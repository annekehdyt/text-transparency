spectacular horror movie
that will give you the chill once
you get settled with it .
the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish ,
the score is chilling ,
but the best about the movie is it
is performance .
it is rare to get scared by performance
and this movie 's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor.the story is very interesting
and gets your attention since the first minute .
though the woman in black does not have much screen time ,
she makes the necessary appearance
to chill the audience in some illiant scene .
