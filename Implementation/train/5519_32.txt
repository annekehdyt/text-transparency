let 's set one thing straight :
this movie does not seek to redefine the genre ,
it is not dr. strangelove o young frankenstein .
it is a silly flick 
with three great female lead
( can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristic ) 
rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey 
charming as ever .
the story is basic :
the three gal were `` loser '' in college ,
and are still after ward it .
poehler is a dog trainer
( who can not even get a date with a blind guy ) ,
posey is an assistant for a senator
( who `` has not been touched by a man
since clinton was in office '' ... i catched
that one several minute later ... i am a little slow 
ok !
) ,
and dracht has a gay fianc\u00e9e
( seth meyer from snl 
funny ) .
they have to prevent the `` uncool '' daughter of the senator
( the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series `` joan of arcadia '' )
to embarrass her during spring eak .
so of course they have to go to watch over her 
and some hilarity ensue .
all in all 
a light 
simple comedy 
quite short ,
and quite enjoyable
