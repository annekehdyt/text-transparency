this is 
in my opinion 
much better than either of the 2 1990 's version ,
but is still not all that good .
it feels dated ,
probably because it is ,
but it does stand up well
compared to other bbc 1980 's period piece such as mansfield park and northanger abbey.the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90 's version ,
and st john river is at least covered ,
although not very well .
timothy dalton is very good as rochester ,
but the actress playing jane is much too old .
there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length
that has more than a tenner spent on it .
