recipe for one of the worst movie of all time :
a she-male villain
who looks like it escaped from the wwf ,
has terrible aim with a gun
that has inconsistent effect
( the first guy
she shoots catch on fire
but when she shoots anyone else
they just disappear )
and takes time out to pet a deer .
then you got the unlikable character 
30 year old college student 
a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lot 
lot more .
avoid at all cost .
