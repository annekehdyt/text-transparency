one woman ,
by herself in a house for 45-minute of screen time ,
does not sound like a formula
to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat ...
but future shock is truly as thrilling
as they come !
writer / star vivian schilling takes on those little fear
we all suppress ,
and enlarges them to terrifying proportion ,
so do not watch this film alone !
