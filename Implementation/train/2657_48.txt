all of the x-man movie were great .
and i mean all of them ,
including the long hated x-man 3.
they had solid character
( magneto and xavier were the best one 
in my opinion ) ,
and a good story arch.i was all excited
when i heard this movie was on production ,
and my expectation grew bigger and bigger
until i saw the movie .
i was so disappointed.hugh jackman is not a bad actor
( his best movie is the fountain ,
although you will not hear about this movie
when they talk about the actor ) ,
and his acting is not what screws the movie up.the whole film is plagued with lot of meaningless character
that add nothing to the plot
( like blob or gambit ) ,
which were tossed there
to make fan believe
that the film maker had read the original comics.i am a fan of xman ,
i have read many 
many of their story and this movie respected none of them .
none .
not even the continuity .
it does not respect weapon x project 
or the relationship between wolverine and saetooth 
or emma frost ,
the motivation for wolverine are plain stupid
and seen in million of movie :
revenge for the death of a loved one.oh .
what i was expecting
the whole darn movie was a berseker momant for wolverine similar to the one
he has in x2 in the school
when stryker man come in
and he alone decimates the enemy force 
but hey 
this is fox 
this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero.beside ,
i had a feeling of constant dej\u00e1 v\u00f9 with this movie
because wolverine 's origin are already explained in x2 ,
we already know
how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something
we already know.i personally believe
that wolverine is one of those few character
that does not need a solid back-story
because mystery is the nature of the character .
do we really want to know
how the joker got his scar ?
