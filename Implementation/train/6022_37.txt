there are plenty of comment already posted saying
exactly how i felt about this film
so ill keep it short .
`` the grinch '' i thought
was marvellous - jim carrey is a truly talented 
physical comedian as well
as being a versatile clever actor
( in my opinion ) .
mike myer on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying .
i used to like him very much in his `` waynes world ''
and `` so i married an axe murderer '' day -
but ive never been fond of austin power
and `` the cat in the hat '' has just finished me off .
this film was horrible -
the gag were horrible !
inappropriate for child not only in adult content but in the fact
that some of them were so dated
they have not amused anyone for 50 year !
the plot was messy 
messy 
messy !
its a shame really
because the child were very likeable
as was `` mom '' .
they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin -
but he could have pulled it off
if it were not for myer ugly ,
revolting over-acted portrayal of the cat.i mean - did myer even glance at a script ?
was one written ?
the other actor seemed to have one -
but the cat just seemed to be winging it ! on the other hand i would like to mention
that the set and prop were marvellous ! ! !
but unfortunately they can not save this film.poor dr seuss -
the man was a genius !
do not ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy 
messy way ! !
! 1/10
