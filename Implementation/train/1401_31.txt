if i were to create a movie thermometer ,
this movie would be absolute zero .
out of ten star 
i would rate it as follows :
plot :
zero star video quality :
zero star sound quality :
zero star acting :
zero starit is as though high school student got together one afternoon with a camera ,
made up a plot
and shot a movie .
it is so lacking in any artistic value
that i would rather watch kid walking around a high school than watch this movie.however ,
something is to be said for the abysymal depth .
the `` shootout '' in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scene ever .
first of all 
the combatant simply wave plastic gun at each other 
jerking their arm back and forth to simulate recoil .
the pair actually `` duck '' each other 's non-existent bullet .
no squibs 
no spark 
no blank 
just waving spraypainted squirtgun around .
if you want to see two grown man play `` actor '' ,
give it a spin someday ...
after you have cleaned the fridge 
combed the carpet 
polished all of the doorknobs 
raked the gravel 
straightened the book on the shelf 
etc .
