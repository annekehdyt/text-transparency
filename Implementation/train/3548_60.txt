in the voice
over which begins the film 
hughie
( billy connolly ) ,
a roadie for the great 70 's band strange fruit 
said
the reason lightning struck at a rock festival
to stop strange fruit
is set was that god was sick of 70 's excess .
indeed 
it is been popular to put down that era of music ,
and see punk as a welcome antidote to it .
while i agree
the excess was tiresome
( as well as the misogynistic urge
which came out of it ) ,
and like punk 
i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock ,
and this film about strange fruit is long ,
strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days.one of the reason
the film works is the care of the person
behind the scene .
brian gibson directed what is love got to do with it 
about tina turner
( while i had problem with the dramatic part of the film ,
the music was handled very well ) ,
writer dick clement and ian le frenais co-wrote the commitment
and were behind the music-oriented british tv show over the rainbow ,
and the song strange fruit played were co-written by foreigner 's mick jone
( not to be confused with the clash 's mick jone ) ,
so it was a meeting of person
who knew
what they were talking about .
also 
two cast member are musician in their own right
( bill nye i do not know about ,
though the film credits him with his own singing ,
and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era ,
while jimmy nail was in another british tv show
which was music-oriented ,
though i forget the name ,
and he was in evita ) ,
and the other are convincing at it .
and while ,
as i said ,
a lot of 70 's band like strange fruit behaved badly towards woman ,
the movie does not make the same mistake
( except for the woman
who follows timothy spall around ) ;
as the manager of the reunion 
juliet auey is quite good
and plays a fully rounded character.the other actor are all good as well 
with special praise to stephen rea ,
who handles the more dramatic role well
without sentimentality .
there are a couple of plot point
which do not work ,
but overall this is quite enjoyable .
oh yeah 
and the music is good too .
