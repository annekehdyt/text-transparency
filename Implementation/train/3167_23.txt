i am normally skeptical about watching film or mini-series based on novel
because the screenplay is always different from the novel .
fortunately 
i was wrong !
the screenplay was very close to the novel
( i guess
it helps
that the author was an executive producer and writer 
huh ?
) the cast is outstanding .
i can not describe
how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actor
( from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert ri'chard and bianca lawson )
.the location
setting ...
i was expecting to see the home and cottage i imagined in my mind :
what i saw on screen was slightly different .
however 
it was not enough to make me dislike the mini-series.i recommend this for anyone
who has read the novel :
you will not be disappointed
if you have .
8/10 star !
