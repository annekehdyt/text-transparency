i usually come on this website prior to going to the movie ,
as i like to see what other person think of the movie .
i read many review
which said
'thriller not a horror movie ' .
this prompted me to give this film a try .
i really must take issue with these 'thriller/horror ' statement ,
as it was neither !
i almost went
and asked for my money back ,
and if you lot of reviewer enjoyed this rubbish ... .well
you must be easily pleased !
at the end of the movie 
the person behind me said
out loud `` what a waste of time '' and i turned to them
and replied `` i could not have summed it up better '' .
i kept waiting for something to happen ...
but it did not .
there was the potential for a lot of good scare
( or thrills
if you like )
but none happened .
william acted the part quite well
but i felt
he was short changed by a poor script
which dithered around and went nowhere .
save your money folk ,
this is a turkey
which will be featuring at a dvd store 'bargain box ' near you in the very foreseeable future !
