as other reviewer have noted ,
this is an unjustly neglected depression-era film .
directed by frank borzage
( two oscar )
and written by jo swerling
( leave her to heaven ,
the westerner 
lifeboat 
etc .
) 
it is a tough-minded 
well-structured and -realized move about denizen of a new york city shantytown .
they are grifter 
beggar ,
and woman forced into prostitution ,
but they are a community of person both good and bad ,
with loyalty as complex as any group's.perhap primary among this movie 's many admirable quality is the contrast between spencer tracy 's character 
bill 
and loretta young 's trina .
he tough-talking 
physically aggressive 
and evidently fearless
-- but bill is not the character
who gives this film its steely sense of survival .
while he blusters ,
trina actually hang tough
( if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike ) .
her devotion to him is obvious 
and complete .
when she becomes pregnant ,
she says
she will raise it herself
if he wants to leave ,
or `` i will even give up the kid
if you will only be happy . ''
such is the dignity of loretta young 's performance
( at age 20 )
as a quite simple character ,
that she seems neither weak or dependent ,
but rather a woman
who recognizes happiness
when she finds it ,
and wants nothing more .
