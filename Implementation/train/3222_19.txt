there is no reason to see this movie .
a good plot idea is handled very badly .
in the middle of the movie everything change and from there on nothing makes much sense .
the reason for the killing are not made clear .
the acting is awful .
nick stahl obviously needs a better director .
he was excellent in in the bedroom ,
but here he is terrible .
amber benson from buffy 
has to change her character someday .
even those of you
who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence
will be disappointed .
even though the movie was 80 minute ,
which is too short for a good movie
( but too long for this one ) ,
there are no deleted scene in the dvd
which means they never bothered to fill in the missing part to the characters.do
not spend the time on this one .
