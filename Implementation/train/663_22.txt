**************possible spoilers********** there is only one reason
why i saw this movie
and that was because i have a massive crush on richard belzer .
( i do not know
that much about humor )
there were some part
that were funny like the barbie and ken spoof and the dealer and the president skit .
mind you this is sometime raunchy
( dare ,
i say crude ? )
it was at time funny ,
but it could have been better .
probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time
getting woman undress ,
the movie would had been funnier .
some skit just make you want to gag ,
and cringe 
other skit make you laugh and oddly enough think .
sadly this movie is dated .
if you have a mad crush on richard belzer
( so worth it )
it is worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase .
