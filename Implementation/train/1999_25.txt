why ?
because for one reason 
there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing `` bye bye birdie '' at the opening .
she reprises it again at the ending ,
too
( in a different mood ! ) .
both wonderful .
rent it and see .
even if that is all of it
that you watch .
you will agree ,
i am sure.everything about the original was so excellent
it just did not need a remake 
sorry !
jason and vanessa gave commendable performance 
as well as tyne and chynna .
in fact 
all the actor and singer in this new version were giving their 'all 
'
but it is like trying to improve on `` casablanca ''
-- it just can not be done !
it is even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally
as you try to appreciate the remake ,
and it just falls short 
through no fault of the actor .
