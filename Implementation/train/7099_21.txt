i would of enjoyed this film
but van damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time .
poo knicker fight scene as per usually .
the only thing this loser left out was the russian
normally end up being killed in the end .
this film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature ,
please please please van damme get some acting lesson ,
you need them .
anyone
who likes van damme
has issue ,
it seems sad
that the only way van damme ever gets any acting work
is
when he co writes the film ,
co produces the film
and does the screen play for the film .
avoid van damme and his slicked back nasty wig .
i give this film a two out of ten ,
because the one with the the sandman was better .
to add insult to injury i wasted a quid on this manure
