effect
( s )
without cause
is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of hollywood remake ,
not only is it possible ,
it is required .
the haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st-class cinematographer-turner-director
who once showed promise
( jan de bont- speed )
but has since produced a string of big budget garbage
( twister 
speed 2 )
.actor are superfluous in a movie of this type
and they seem to realize it .
liam neeson and cathrine zeta-jone act like they wish
they were anywhere but in this film .
lili taylor makes an attempt
to add something to the proceedings
but whatever
that something might be is unknown
since the script feel
like half of it is missing .
event just happen ,
good and bad ghost show up with no rhyme or reason
and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non-event meant
to wrap up the previous 90 minute of inanity.there really is not even reason to see this for the effect since we all know
that anything can be put on screen now .
why not watch effect in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake ?
