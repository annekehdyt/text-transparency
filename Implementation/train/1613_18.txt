i can not for the life of me explain
what the popularity of the child 's television show 
power ranger is all about.i never understood
why unsuspecting child liked this show in the first place ,
since the character seem so idiotic
and not worth caring about whatsoever.the costume look completely atrocious 
like multi colored spandex
that person wear to go to the gym.what
exactly is the purpose of this show anyways ,
but for kid to learn how to fight to solve their problem ?
what is up with the awful hair cut ,
and clothing on this show anyway ?
not to mention this show is still playing on cable television ,
just to make money to teach kid how to fight each other
when they disagree on a certain problem.there is far better entertainment for today 's child ,
hopefully they are not as gullible as kid of the 1990
who watched this show.oh ,
and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green ranger anyway ?
