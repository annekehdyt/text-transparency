i picked this dvd up at the dollar store .
the dvd was on the 2 for $ 1 rack ,
but
since it had michael madsen in it ,
i thought
that
since i had never seen the movie ,
i bought it
anyway.i
must say
that i did not like the movie .
the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else .
i found
that the director 's use of flashback did not add to the story line for me .
i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.i will not throw it away like one of the other commentator ,
but it may be quite awhile
before i would consider watching this movie again.who knows ,
since it was michael madsen 's film debut ,
maybe it might have some archival value at some future date .
