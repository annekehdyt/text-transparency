i just finished watching this film
and found it very enjoyable .
it is a quiet 
little film
that does not overwhelm you with special effect or `` big '' performance .
it simply takes you into the life of the person
living in a small hamlet in the backwood of north carolina .
henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker 
a young loner
who finds a baby
abandoned in the wood .
toker 's search for the baby 's parent takes him on a journey
that will have a profound impact on his life .
david srathairn plays truman lester 
a slimy conman with an ulterior motive .
and david plays the bad guy to perfection .
there is much more to this film
than first meets the eye .
filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music 
it is worth watching .
