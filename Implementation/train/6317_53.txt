i do not watch soap .
my grandmother still watches
that one with the hour glass .
i made fun of them it
when i was ten
( it was so easy )
.but this movie takes parody
and spells it a new way .
i found the story pretty damn funny .
the fashion of the 80 's - shoulder pad 
sequin 
and polyester - just top it off .
the huge hair 
the high heel 
and the histrionic -
what a combination.and all the actor just go to town ,
chewing up their part
and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile .
sally 
kevin 
elisabeth - wonderful !
whoopi - great !
robert downey - refreshing to see him back
when he had such potential 
before the tabloid .
and garry :
why did we have to wait so long to see him on film ?
leesa gibbon - had not been missing her 
but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter
( and where do you apply for that job 
anyway ?
) .admittedly 
i could have done
without sally climbing the drainpipe .
lucy ricardo did it ,
how many time ? ,
as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i do not know
who and i am so done with it now ,
i could spit peanut
if i had them .
apparently it is what you do
when you are being funny in a tall building in new york .
i am just thankful they did not pull out the flagpole bit.but
it was cute ,
it was funny ,
it had plot twist ,
it had an after credit ending before
that was common ,
it had clothe worthy of a second glance ,
it had a great cast
and it is got personal memory for me .
really 
what more do you need ?
