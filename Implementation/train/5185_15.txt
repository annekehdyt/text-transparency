i just rented creep
and was not at all impressed .
i did not feel anything in this film .
i felt sick
because the gore alone was shocking.i walked out of my living room several time in desperation
that something would happen with this film .
have not we seen this all before ?
i did not like any of the character barr the guy in the sewer cage .
i felt bad for him .
but then again i could not think as to why he was still alive
and not murdered by the creep ?
so many question need to be answered.someone mentioned reference to the ps2 game silent hill
and i can see similarity vaguely.not a bad film 
not a good one .
judge for yourself .
