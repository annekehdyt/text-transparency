with the mixed review this got i was not expecting too much ,
and was pleasantly surprised .
it is a very entertaining small crime film with interesting character 
excellent portrayal ,
writing
that is eezy
without being glib ,
and a good pace .
it looks good too 
in a funky way .
apparently person either like this movie or just hate it ,
and i am one
who liked it .
