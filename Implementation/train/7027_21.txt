this is my favorite of the older tom and jerry cartoon from the early 40 's .
the original version with mammy two shoe is on the tom and jerry spotlight collection 2 set 
disc one ,
and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoon .
the gags on this one are not all madcap avery style 
but more subtle and aimed at anyone
who 's ever stayed up late watching scary movie
( or radio program ) !
tom is listening to a creepy radio show ,
and jerry decide to play a number of trick to spook him .
the nine-lives gag is well done here ,
and i do not know
how many time i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet
that scary
when i was a kid .
when tom 's owner is awakened by the ruckus- mammy was not the maid ,
it was her house-
she gets one heck of a surprise 
with a big laugh .
get your pause button ready ,
it is worth it !
