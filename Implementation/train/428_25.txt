johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category
with it is overblown gag and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story
that makes any sense .
but that is the point 
right ?
the cast is likable ;
michael keaton an excellent comic performer
before he took himself too seriously as the year passed .
griffin dunne 
peter boyle 
joe piscopo 
marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm
and at least get a lot of laugh from me .
but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri
( sneaking the word `` icehole '' into movie history )
as a mobster
who fares best at murdering the english language.i associate many childhood memory with this film ,
as i watched
it quite often so maybe i
am prone to enjoy it more than many other .
johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof
that even relays some well meaning message about the danger of smoking
( and sex )
.i like it
but it is hard to recommend.7/10 .
