i like brad pitt enormously .
he is an actor with ain and wit ,
not to mention face 
pectoral and all the rest .
since i saw him in `` thelma and louise ''
a thought has been bothering me ,
who does he remind me of ?
`` troy '' did it for me .
he is the new brigitte bardot .
the difference are obvious of course .
male 
american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless .
he is so beautiful
that he is at his most effective
when he plays againt it .
`` kalifornia '' `` 12 monkey '' `` fight club '' `` snatch '' his self deprecating humor makes him human 
almost accessible .
fortunately `` troy '' will soon be forgotten .
only still photographs with pitt ,
semi naked in ravishing sprint position will decorate the wall of legion of salivating fan .
strange 
`` das boot '' is one of the great film of the second part of the 20th century .
what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this ?
well 
i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance
of working with the new brigitte bardot .
