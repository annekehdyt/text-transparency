yes 
it is flawed -
especially if you are into hollywood film
that demand a lot of effect 
a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot ,
and you can not actually think
for yourself.roeg 's film are for the intelligent film-goer ,
and insignificance is a perfect example.the characterization are illiant ,
the story is excellent 
but 
like all nic roeg 's film -
it has you thinking on every level about aspect of reality
that would never have dawned on you before .
his film always make you think ,
and personally 
i like that in a film.so do not expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy ,
because it is likely you will be disappointed.but i think
it is excellent .
