a surprise thriller with more twist and double cross than a doodle pad .
a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot
overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl .
nicholas cage is a very underrated actor
and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind
looking for the right thing
to do .
j.t .
walsh
( rip to a great actor )
is always a wonderful villain ,
as is dennis hopper .
it is such a shame
he never made to a higher profile in the biz .
i am sure
he has his follower 
though .
in all 
this is a great film
that shows you
that you do not need big bang or a commercial soundtrack
to be an entertaining film .
