i tried to like this program ;
i really did .
i even bought the pilot film 
first on vhs and later on dvd .
however 
i could not get into this story
because its two main character :
`` david ''
( bruce willis )
and `` maddie ''
( cybill shepherd )
just seemed to in love with themselves 
for one thing .
i admit was some clever dialog in the show ,
which was a key part of the success of the tv program ,
and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog .
basically 
this was almost like the old screwball comedy movie of the '30s and '40s with male versus female .
you get lot of arguing 
accusation ,
yelling and screaming .
a lot of person apparently love that sort of bickering ,
but i hate it ,
so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon .
only allyce beasley as the hapless aide `` agne 
''
was entertaining .
it is too bad
she had such little air time .
shepherd was nice on the eye and i suppose woman
would say
the same for willis 
but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off .
