i do not know
if the problem i had with this movie
is that i was not able to capture the way
movie were done in the past
but i believe
that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable convention available in the 40s
to make a film .
if you do not have anything better
to do my advise
is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk .
