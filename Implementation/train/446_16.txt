what starts out as a very predictable
and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining .
`` right to die '' is not very suspenseful
but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set piece and over the top gore.spoiler here :
top credit also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable character ever
to grace the screen .
playing the character in a great `` aloof '' fashion ,
you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end
when his grand plan ultimately fails .
corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery
playing a not-so-good-guy
who gets his just desserts.end of spoiler.as a revenge-from-the-dead flick 
`` right to die ''
benefit heavily from it is performer
and is more than an ok way
to spend less than an hour .
