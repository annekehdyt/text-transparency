i thought
this was a great idea but 
boy ,
was it poorly executed .
we do get a oad sense
of how complex
and challenging the backstage operation of a show are ,
but virtually no specific about any of it works .
the producer do not seem to have found any way
to tell a story
or give the viewer a `` through-line . ''
( which is not to say
they did not try ,
but having the stagehand relate a synopsis of the ring cycle
as the program 's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job
of physically mounting an opera .
)
we see lot of thing happening ,
but are told little about what it is that the person are doing and why .
there is little sense
of who is who ,
or how the various production department fit and work together .
for instance 
several time we hear about a problem of some sort
-- one expects then to see the problem and its consequence and/or
how it gets resolved .
but instead the filmmaker generally just cut to something else
( generally 
pretty generic footage of person pushing stuff or talking into headset . )
overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of image
that you would see run under the closing credit of a show 
rather than anything worth
watching for its own merit .
