i checked this movie out
when it still had 6 vote
and it said like 7.2 or something ,
but seriously this is a horrible movie .
let eak it down .
the first thing
you notice
about this movie
is that it was filmed on a hand-held digital camera
owned by a freshman at a community college .
the next thing
you will notice
is that the actor 
are all friend of said freshman
( he probably met them at the pub the night before .
third on the list you will notice
that the musical editing is horrible ,
and they try to cram many song into this movie 
at 30 second interval ...
also all digital editing is done on said
freshman 's home pc ... probably using window movie maker .
this movie was horrible ... pretentious ,
had an undeniably bad script ,
and acting
that followed suit .
i would not recommend this movie to anyone i know ,
but i do sentence the writer and director
to watch this movie in hell for an eternity .
