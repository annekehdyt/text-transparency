could this be by the same director
as do not look now or bad timing ?
poorlyacted 
clunkily edited .
you only have to compare the various accident scene in this with similar one in do not look now to see how much roeg has lost histouch.even the generally reliable teresa russell
( looking a bit chunky these day ,
i am afraid to report )
can not save this one .
the plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum ,
the acting is wooden and roeg 's attempt at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.avoid this one like the plague .
