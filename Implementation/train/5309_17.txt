tripping over .
i must say
at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episode ,
but having faith in the show ,
and abe forsythe is unquestionable talent ,
i continued to watch .
i can safely say
i am now glad
that i did .
the story did develop quite well ,
and all the character have a strong base ,
and most do not have any information missing.the
only thing
i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice
and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie.some good
acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line .
here is to hoping for another season !
