... ... .playing kaddiddlehopper 
col san fernando 
etc .
the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream .
i love watching him interact w/ amanda blake 
or don knott or whomever
-- he clearly was having a ball
and i think
he made it easier on his guest as well --
so long as they knew ahead of time
it was not a disciplined ,
19 take kind of production .
relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there.he reminds me of guy like milton berle 
benny hill ,
maybe jerry lewis some too .
great timing 
ancient gag
that kept audience in stitch for decade ,
sheer enjoyment about what he was doing .
his sad little clown he played was good too
-- but in a touching manner.personally i think
he is great ,
having just bought a two dvd set of his show from '61 or so ,
it ings his stuff back in a fond way for me .
i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run
when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.check this out
if you are a fan or curious .
he was a riot .
