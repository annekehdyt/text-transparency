the cover of the box makes this movie look really good ,
do not be fooled .
splatter university came out in 1984
which was the last good year for horror 
but this movie sucks .
the character are so annoying .
only the teacher is cool .
there is like no plot to this movie ,
who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film ? spoiler up aheadthe teacher dies in this ,
and it was a female ,
we all know
that we must have a female surviver ,
if you are going to eak the rule do it in a good horror flick not this waste
