a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way .
cinema
after all is a visual medium
and igor
used its full potential .
a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind .
in one of the compartment he meets with a girl .
word are not exchanged
but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar character and situation .
the two lead are perfectly cast
as their unique feature tell you a story
that needs no word .
