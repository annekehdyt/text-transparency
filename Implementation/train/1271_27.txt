this is a very bad movie .
i laughed once or twice ,
and the storyline sucks !
there is maybe one funny joke ,
it is stupid
and it is boring .
through the whole short movie 
i was falling asleep and wondering
when it was going to end.no one act human ,
and everyone act stupid and ridiculous .
rob schneider acting like an animal is not something
i would pay to see .
it looked funny ,
but the bottom line :
do not waste you are precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie.i was wondering
when it was going to end ,
even though it is a short movie .
in the beginning we thought
it would get better ;
but it gets worse .
stupid 
all the way to the end .
i walked out of the theater ,
and i would remember
that movie as extremely bad forever.the writer and co-producer of this film is a simpson tv writer ,
but this is nothing like the simpson
( this movie sucks ! ! ! )
