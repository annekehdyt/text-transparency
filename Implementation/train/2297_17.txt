well 
i could nt get into the plot ,
but thats just me maybe .
listless camera-movement at time 
nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality.the acting is genuine at time and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence
involving scan notily clad lady ,
which was nice .
the climax is confused and disjointed ,
but still ... err riveting 
thanx to stella stevens.the stunt are interesting ,
specially
because of the 70 's las vegas backdrop .
there are a few jerky hand-held camera-movement at the end ,
which keep me guessing ,
for a while .
but i do not think i ll b chasing the dvd 
just yet .
