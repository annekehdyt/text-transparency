i awake suddenly ,
aware
that i am drooling onto the plastic couch cover ,
and realize
it is a warm saturday afternoon .
why was i sleeping ?
did i hit my head ?
or accidentally swallow all of my grandma 's muscle relaxer ?
could it be adult onset narcolepsy ?
no 
i momentarily paused on cheap seat
while channel surfing ,
and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed
that i blacked out.it is that head-shaking 
mouth-agape 
shoulder-shrugging bad .
but i have to give these moronic and boring twin credit
for selling this idea through .
perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive
that they had on me ,
and
when he/she woke up ,
a few horrendous episode were already in the can
and he/she hoped
that
since all the viewer will be asleep ,
no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $ 425,000 annual salary.you
have been warned .
