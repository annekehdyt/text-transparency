what a great gem this is .
it is an unusual story
that is fun to watch .
yes 
it has singing ,
but it is very nicely crafted into the story
and is very melodic to hear .
it was so pleasant to watch ;
i enjoyed it from start to finish !
the movie takes place in england during world war ii .
it is about an apprentice witch
who is searching for a missing portion of a spell
that she needs .
she uses her rough `` magic ''
to transport her and 3 child under her care to various destination to find it .
they are joined by her correspondence teacher ,
who is surprised to learn
that the lesson from his school actually work !
although the special effect may seem a little dated at first ,
once you get used
to them they become part of the charm of this movie .
in fact 
the movie won an oscar for these effect !
the movie is innocent and fun -
and it is hard not to like the tuneful song .
the character are wonderfully interesting to watch .
i think
anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie .
