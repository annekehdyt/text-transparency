if i accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i
would read it and maybe laugh .
i would not 
however laugh at the point in the film
where the director would seem to want me to laugh .
although i am still not altogether sure where these are .
i do not care
if this is woody allen ,
this writer can not write dialogue ,
or at least he can not knowingly write dialogue
then draw performance from actor capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clown .
for example :
( paraphrase )
`` i am an art historian ,
i am looking to get a job in an art gallery . ''
ok ,
so it states the fact but honestly ,
do you know of any art historian
who would say that ?
how would you answer ?
`` really ?
an art gallery ?
who would 've thought it ?
`` the entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi-intellectualism
that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer .
i admit
that i have no knowledge of allen 's other work and 
judging by this one i do not want to start learning .
the character are loathsome
without exception 
an attempt
to illustrate
that we all suffer from the human condition ?
or really really poor character writing ?
you be the judge .
