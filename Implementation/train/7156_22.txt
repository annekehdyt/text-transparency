although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie .
in part because i usually give every movie an even eak ,
and because i thought
that a single movie could not be that bad .
i stand corrected .
not even george kennedy 
barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of ick .
only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh .
namely during the simon says scene .
the other joke are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny .
and some of them you actually see coming a mile away .
this movie just has not got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane !
( i+ii ) ,
naked gun
( i+ii+iii ) ,
or scary movie .
they all had a. funny gag 
b. good dialog and most important of all c. unforgettable quote .
man in white has got d. none of the above .
to call this movie bad would be a gross understatemant .
avoid this movie anyway you can !
consider yourself warned !
