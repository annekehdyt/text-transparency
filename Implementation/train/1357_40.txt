`` caveman '' exceeded my expectation ,
and not in a good way .
it was even worse than i thought
it would be .
basically 
here is the show :
the caveman are an alternate race ,
they face prejudice 
etc .
quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created ;
almost being worthy of jail time for the writer .
one show featured the caveman going into a club ,
trying to pick up girl ,
and then nothing else happened .
it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog ,
followed by death by steak knife via midget cannibal .
for those
who have not seen this show ,
here is an example of the dialog :
`` you are sure
you are okay with going out with a caveman . ''
`` yeah 
that is fine .
i have had like 10 - thousand ! ''
hilarious ... possibly the best writing i have ever witnessed.22 minute of caveman with horrible makeup 
tackling tough social issue ... sounds like an entertaining night .
i also love
how bad the recent idea are
that they are resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercial .
i wonder
if they will do the gecko next ,
so that i can have a new title for the worst show i
have ever seen .
i would even say
that this is worse than `` viva laughlin . ''
at least `` viva laughlin '' was ripped off from something
that was somewhat inspired.shows like this make me hope
that there is a comet up there somewhere
aimed for earth .
( unratable honestly ... )
