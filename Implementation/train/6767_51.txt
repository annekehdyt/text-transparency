somerset maugham 's character are ought to life in rko 's `` of human bondage '' ;
but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel 
with bette davis ' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy .
otherwise 
it is the story of leslie howard
( as philip carey ) ;
he dreams of becoming a painter ,
but is told he has no talent for the art .
as the film progresses 
mr. howard 's struggle 
instead 
to become a doctor .
his effort seem to indicate some bad advice
regarding the art ;
though successful in medicine 
his painting seemed easier - also ,
note the symbolism of his disability 
a `` club foot ''
( explained in the film )
.along the way
( right away 
in this version ) ,
howard become infatuated with waitress davis
( as mildred roger ) .
davis ' characterization of `` mildred '' is extraordinary 
culminating in a spectacular speech ,
when she tells howard 
among other thing ,
that she had to `` wipe my mouth ! ''
after kissing him .
howard also performs well ,
but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis ;
so 
their performance are wasted .
still 
a film to watch for the acting ,
including some good supporting player .
bette davis ' characterization was famous for inspiring a `` write-in '' campaign for the 1934 `` best actress '' academy award .
for the record 
she placed third .
the result were :
1. claudette colbert -
`` it happened one night ''
2. norma shearer
- `` the barretts of wimpole street '' 3. bette davis
- `` of human bondage '' 4. grace moore
- `` one night of love '' ******* of human bondage
