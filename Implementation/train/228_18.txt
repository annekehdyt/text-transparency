the filming is pleasant
and the environment is keenly realistic .
i liked
that it boldly redresses conception of the many difficult moral and social moray of the 1930 's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human question -
i felt
i could get a real sense of the time 
recreated even in splendid shot of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depiction of street living .
it seemed worthwhile to experience .
the interwoven role
which buddhism play
is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect 
perhaps the most effective
that i have seen in chinese film .
casting is great .
image are memorable .
acting is solid enough .
thematically puerile but still rich enough
to compliment the vehicle of its expression .
