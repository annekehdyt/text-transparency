let 's think person ,
quit bad-mouthing the original ,
for it is time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece 
even still with all the star 
story line and art .
lorne greene was great
as adama and richard hatch was perfect
as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck ,
but i dare say ,
not as pretty as katee as starbuck .
i loved the episode with the pegasus and greeting from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar 
war of the god 
the best was experiment in terra ,
i thought
that was a tribute in a way
to heaven can wait ,
then you had the woman of battlestar ,
not to compare them to let 's say tricia
who is outstandingly beautiful as number six ,
but jane seymour 's beauty could not be compared to .
let alone loerrta spang
as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty
that a rainbow would be embarrassed by .
i loved the original as much
as the new .can you imagine
if john calicos had a number six ?
: )
thankyou for listening .
