i did not like this bill murray vehicle
when it was originally released in the 80s ,
so i tried watching it again to see
if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going taste in the 80s
or was it that `` stripe '' is simply a bad movie .
well 
the verdict is in and `` stripe '' is a bad movie.now ,
`` stripe '' may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s ,
and it may appeal to person
who have gone through basic training
or who are bill murray fan ,
but its still a bad movie.why is it bad ?
mostly because `` stripe '' is supposed to be a comedy
but it is just not that funny .
there are some laugh ,
but they are few and far between .
most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot
which is incredibly convoluted
and not very interesting .
this lack of comedy is especially noticeable
if you are used to more contemporary comedy such as `` anchorman ''
which strive for laugh in every part of the movie .
`` stripe '' further suffer from bill murray and harold ramis 's lack of acting ability .
bill murray is a great comedian
but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career ,
and harold ramis is playing harold ramis .
these two are just not good enough as actor to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.lastly 
most of the comedy
that there is in `` stripe '' revolves around bill murray 's self-centered 
smart-alec man-child character
so if you do not find that character funny
( like i did not )
you are not going to find most of what little comedy there is in `` stripe '' funny either .
`` stripe '' is very much a movie of its era ,
it has not aged well
and is not worth watching .
if you want to watch an early 80 's `` buddy '' comedy i
would recommend `` stir crazy . ''
like `` stripe '' the humor in `` stir crazy '' is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedy ,
but unlike `` stripe '' it has aged much better
and as a result is still watchable .
