when my 14-year-old daughter and her friend get together for movie night ,
there is one movie
they insist on watching over and over again :
you guessed it 
k-911 
the third installment in the highly successful k-9 franchise
starring everybody 's favorite tv dad 
jim belushi.folk ,
i knew
it was possible to wear out a vhs tape 
but a dvd ? !
this has been played so often that it is starting to skip ; no joke !
but of course you will have that
when you own a film so charming ,
so illiant.of course ,
we have to thank the one and only tom hank for introducing us to the beloved cop-dog genre with turner and hooch ; however ,
even that film does not measure up to the sheer excellence
presented in all three k-9 movies.some nay-sayer say
belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series .
poppycock 
i say .
while you might suspect
that a third installment - direct-to-video 
at that - may not seem like something worth watching ,
you would prove yourself wrong
after watching this quality movie.i will not give away the plot ,
but i will say
that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet - one
that will have you howling with laughter !
it is a shame
john belushi is not alive to see what great strides his other has made in the acting world.i
highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bff at her next slumber party .
do not forget the puppy chow !
