i grew up watching this movie ,
and i still love it just as much today
as when i was a kid .
do not listen to the critic review .
they are not accurate on this film.eddie murphy really shines in his roll.you can sit down with your whole family
and everybody will enjoy it.i recommend this movie to everybody to see .
it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.with demon 
dragon ,
and a little bald kid with god like powers.this movie takes you from l.a. to tibet 
of into the amazing view of the wondrous temple of the mountain in tibet.just a beautiful view !
so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up !
you wont regret it !
