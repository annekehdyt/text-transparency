in 1958 
clarksberg was a famous speed trap town .
much revenue was generated by the sheriff 's department catching speeder .
the one
who tried to outrun the sheriff ?
well 
that gave the sheriff a chance
to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser .
for example 
in the beginning of the movie 
a couple of serviceman on leave
trying to get back to base on time
are pushed off to their death 
if i recall correctly .
then one day 
a stranger drove into town .
possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world .
michael mccord .
even his name is a car name 
as in mccord gasket .
in possibly the ultimate hot rod .
a black flamed '34 ford coupe .
the color of death 
evil and hellfire .
he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose .
he checks out the lay of the land .
he is the other of one of the sheriff 's victim .
he know how his other died .
the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff .
there is only one way
to get justice served for the killing of his other and to fix thing
so `` this are not a-ever gon na happen again to anyone '' :
recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death .
he goes out to the curve and practice .
the sheriff know mccord know .
the race begins ... this is a movie
to be remembered by anyone
who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road .
