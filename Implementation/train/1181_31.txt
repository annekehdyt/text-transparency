barman directed any way the wind blows
as he would sing a deus song .
anarchy rule over a logical and common strain of thought .
the story behind this movie just goes any
which way the wind blows .
and that can truly be refreshing to watch ,
if you are prepared
and willing that is .
viewer who state
that there is nothing
to keep the story-lines together
are right .
who the hell is that windman anyway ?
still 
i really enjoyed this movie .
antwerp is a beautiful 
bustling 
happening place and any way captures
that feeling .
it also captures the silliness 
the racism 
the bureaucracy 
the addiction and the violence
that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city .
the movie is entertaining 
funny and a little shallow .
barman 's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut .
in that light some might be disappointed .
but then again 
'worst case scenario ' would be a subtle subtitle for any way
the wind blows .
