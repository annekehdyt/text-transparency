at the end of this episode holme ask watson not to record the case for posterity.for a good reason !
the super sleuth left his little grey cell
( sorry agatha )
at home for this tale .
there is no deductive reasoning 
no acute analysis of sign at crime scene .
holme bumble along fifty yard behind the plot .
the dastardly cam is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner
that would have made charle bronson 's heart swell with pride-six bullet in the eadbasket.in an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of watson 's shoes.mercifully
the writer did not decide to tack on the story of cinderella to lengthen the film.the murderess 
holme and watson 
escape scot free .
oh well 
it is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian london.a bit of sixgun law :
