ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian
who completely loses himself in his role 
particularly as shakespeare 's othello .
critically-lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree ,
having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin .
unfortunately 
the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here ,
and the backstage business is overripe .
mikl\u00f3s r\u00f3zsa also won an oscar for his score ,
and shelley winter has a few fine moment a tough waitress
( when theatrical colman eathlessly addresses her ,
she asks him ,
`` what are ya ?
some kind of nut ? `` ) .
otherwise 
this scenario is awfully obvious 
surprisingly draggy 
and not very funny .
