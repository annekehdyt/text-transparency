jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick
which offers little else of value .
completely lacking in eroticism 
excitement 
or leading lady with appeal .
one decent fight 
a few moment of mild suspense .
and a one-note plot.the movie waxe philisophic in a series of conversation between law 's character and a dogged homicide detective ,
well played by timothy spall .
but despite their best effort ,
both actor are staked to the cross of the film 's banality.with a lesser actor in the lead role
-- and without the benefit of oliver curtis 's cinematography --
crocodile would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickie .
