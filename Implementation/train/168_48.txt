spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon 
with a flawless idea ,
and almost every single short is a gem .
while i must say
that this is definitely an inferior short
compared such other classic tom and jerry short ,
there is not way
you can hate this cartoon .
sure 
it is understandable to say
that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episode ,
and i can say
that i agree ,
but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episode are great ,
but some are just better than other .
well 
this would fit into `` other . ''
here is the plot of fraidy cat .
tom is listening to an old scary radio oadcast ,
and become easily frightened .
jerry observes how scared he is ,
and try to scare him even more than he already is .
he creates scary dilemmas for tom ,
and tom become scared out of his wit 
and his life .
jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and control it ,
thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost .
tom finds out
that jerry did all of this 
and chases him .
tom then accidentally bites the house maid .
however 
at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared
after he sees his reflection in a flour cup.overall ,
this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there ,
but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time .
it makes me wish
that there was more cartoon like this .
the slapstick and gags in this
that make tom and jerry famous
are as good as ever in this short ,
but it felt
like something was missing in this .
it felt slower than most tom and jerry short .
anyway 
this is a good short
that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoon ,
but it is still nice.7/10
