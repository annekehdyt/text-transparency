a sad 
sad sight indeed is the munster 's revenge .
the munster are ought back one last time
( fred gywnne received a huge paycheck
to come back to the role of herman munster )
in this made-for-tv movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and herman
that are robot `` terrorizing '' the city
as preparation for a robbery of a mummy 's stash at an exhibit .
with the police on their heel 
the two elderly television icon try to find out
who is actually behind the crime in order to clear their name .
we get to see them dress in drag as waitress
( a minor highpoint in the film ) ,
grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple time
( one time even flying to transylvania with herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer mile i guess ) ,
and a most annoying relative `` the phantom '' constantly sing and eak glass ad nausium !
what is most sad is hard to pinpoint :
is it that gywnne
( especially )
and al lewis look so haggard in every scene
and so indifferent to the material .
is it the hokey costume of the robot
that have that school production value look about them .
maybe it is the ridiculous script .
sid caesar 's crazy 
mostly unfunny antic .
or perhaps it is seeing something
which ought me joy and fond memory as a child
being treated to a super k-mart fashion makeover .
at any even 
the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standard .
as for the rest of the cast 
yvonne de carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role
( though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her year and experience ) .
k. c. martell makes an ever-so-not affable eddie munster .
jo mcdonell is an attractive marilyn .
bob hasting as the aforementioned phantom look and act and speak in the most absurd manner .
the film has a real cheap feel
about it even for a made-for-tv movie .
