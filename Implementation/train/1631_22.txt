i saw this film
when i was a young child on television
( thank-you canadian broadcasting corporation )
and had nightmare about it for year afterwards.trnka was one of the mentor for bratislav pojar 
one of canada 's national film board 's best animator .
pojar was ,
in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin .
if you like trnka you should see `` night angel '' .the symbolism
is obvious 
but deftly used .
the opposition of beauty and life
( the plant )
are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand .
the poor puppet hero is condemned
despite a lack of political agenda.what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor .
the small room
where the action takes place
is the character 's entire world .
the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.beautiful and haunting film .
i found a copy of this and other wonderful short by trnka at the public liary
and showed it to my own kid .
a must see .
