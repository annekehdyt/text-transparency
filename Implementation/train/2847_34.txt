i know i know
it was a good ending
but sincerely it was awesome .
i love
when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature
but this time i was impressed with darth vader
turning against the emperor i
really stayed astonished .
the anguishing sequence in that film was
when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious .
he is about to be destroyed
when darth vader 
dark lord of the sith 
eliminates his dark master .
a nice sacrifice .
the cinematography of this film is impressive .
i was surprised with all the vessel of the rebel battle ship and all imperial war ship and super star destroyer .
i loved the new race
they ought on screen the mon calomari 
the ewok 
the sullesteian
( lando 's co pilot )
and many more ... most of my favorite scene are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor
and is fatally wounded .
2-
when luke sees the spirit of obi-wan and yoda
and then it shows up anakin skywalker
( sebastian shaw )
( the greatest scene in star war )
3-
when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord.i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star war between darth vader v.s luke skywalker on the death star .
post-script :
the scene with leia in the slave bikini are memorable .
9/10 .
