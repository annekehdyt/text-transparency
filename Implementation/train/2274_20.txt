if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of person
being run over by car
( you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel ,
being twisted as the car passes over her
before she goes under the back wheel
-- and they show
it twice in case
you missed it the first time )
then this is the documentary for you .
admitedly i did not watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism ,
but that was enough for me .
maybe the rest is even better.i wonder
how long it is going to take for television network
to start showing slush movie .
perhaps game show
based on self-mutilation
might be nice.i already know
that there are disturbed person in the world
and that horrible thing happen .
i do not need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment .
