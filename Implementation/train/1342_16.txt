this movie is funny and painful at the same time .
the `` cinemagic '' almost gave me a seizure .
despite what they imply ,
`` cinemagic '' is not some innovative technical procedure .
it was `` developed '' as the result of an accident ,
and they used it
because it disguised the fact
that their `` monster '' were so stupid-looking .
i also do not think
it is a coincidence
that the writer is sid `` pink '' .this movie is good for a laugh ,
if you are really looking for a movie
made in 9 day on 200,000 dollar .
it is entertaining ;
at least i can say that about it .
the bat/rat/spider is the highlight .
