the woman in black was a british
made for tv movie
which was first oadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of '89 
and again in '92 .
i believe
it made a round on american tv on aande .
it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90 's
but went out of print .
a u.s. company released it on dvd later ,
but that version also sold out .
according to the website of the author of the book ,
the right to the movie are now owned by someone else
and that it will not be released again ,
and that there are unofficial bootleg being sold on ebay.i first
heard about this movie just recently on a message board
and had to check it out .
i found a copy on ebay for about 28 buck .
it is certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east ,
even though the dvd says ,
`` made in canada 
'' ha ha .
but it is a good copy ,
and you can not really fault the bootleg label for releasing stuff
that is rare 
out of print ,
and lost in legal disputes.i love the movie .
it is a period piece set in the 1920 's 
with all the very authentic and quaint british setting of that time .
the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark .
for the most part 
the movie is very low-key 
but effective and scary .
there is no self indulgent gore 
violence or much at all in special effect ,
but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moment .
it is a chilling classic styled ghost movie .
the movie itself looks like
it could have been made in the 1930 's except for the color .
without all the flash of all the modern horror movie ,
i am afraid this film will always just be a lost gem .
for me 
it places itself as one of my all time favorite .
