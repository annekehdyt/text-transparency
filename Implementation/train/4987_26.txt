this film was terrible .
i have given it the high score of 2
as i have seen worse ,
but very few.from the clich\u00e9d start
of having the end of the film at the start
and going back to the start at the end this film
used everything in the box of trick
used in film
making just for the sake of it 
like a kid with too many toy .
there was the endless 
boring repetitive narration 
slow motion 
freeze frame 
flashback and merged image etc - none of which made a dull film
any better.it is called `` 16 year of alcohol '' ,
but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film
jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense .
the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor
and it is a shame
that person have put up further money for more film by mr jobson ,
previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense
as this film does.i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope
of it getting better i carried on to the bitter
but it really was a waste of time
and i would have been better off not bothering .
