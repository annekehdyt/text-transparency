i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie !
the line 
pacing 
and timing of event in that film are outstanding !
however 
this european vacation sequel is a major let down.in this sequel ,
the griswald win a european vacation on a game show .
the problem is that many of the joke in the film are little more than mild 
`` ha-ha '' laugh .
for example 
a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark ,
`` do you want your coke in the can ? ''
clark answer back 
`` no 
i will have it right here . ''
that is really about the only line
that is funny in this film.european vacation 's humor
is strained .
as if the writer borrowed all the joke from the first movie ,
tried to re-hash a script
that had been done before ,
and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.worse 
the natural comic standout like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kid
who played rusty and audrey from the first movie
so well
are nowhere to be found .
their replacement are not funny ,
can not act ,
and just look like they are going through the motion most of the time .
there are also a few crude sex joke and comment
that are not only not funny ,
they are in bad taste.the griswald 's should have stayed in wally world .
the place that made them legends !
do not join them on this european dreadful adventure .
viewer should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this !
you will be glad you did .
