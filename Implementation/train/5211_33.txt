this film has a rotting core of flexible morality 
and yet a quirky sense of justice .
so many of the regular jo among us would love to `` stick it to the man '' .
the `` man '' in this case is represented by several different character .
mr. keller ,
who carla report to at her office .
later 
paul owes 70 large to mr. marchand the club owner .
and then there is paul 's parole officer .
there seems to be so much question about this last character 's side story .
reviewer point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonist ,
escalating tit-for-tat
until their life change dramatically .
they are beholden to each agent of the `` man '' .
one or both could be fired 
killed 
or imprisoned if
they do not do
as they are told.the film has a sense of relief at the end .
carla finally gets laid .
her boss is forced out for being a jerk .
mr. club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom .
they get the $ money $ .
and ... they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer ,
because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement
( or whatever the police found to arrest him ) .
it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler
that wound us up so tight .
never mind
that someone else may get paul 's file later to supervise his release ;
for the moment they are free !
they might even get away with it !
woohoo ... they stuck it to the man !
