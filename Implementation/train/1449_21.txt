gus van sant has made some excellent film .
i truly am a fan.however ,
i can not help but feel
that the cereal edge of tom robbin book
`` even cowgirls get the blue ''
is lost in translation to the big screen .
alone 
tom robbin and gus van sant are incredible visionary and tower of talent .
ultimately though this one just did not work .
it was not that the character were not well developed or the plot
and content did not come alive .
it is just that our imagination are much more powerful
when reading a book like this .
we are taken away to a different time and place
and we sometimes think
the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book
as it neatly unfolds
according to the author 's precision .
movie however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience .
this is what i believe
happened here.i suggest reading the book !
