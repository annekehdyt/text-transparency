i saw this movie literally directly
after finishing the book ,
and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one .
i think
it was the latter .
first of all 
it was inaccurate in many small ,
yet important detail .
one of the first thing i noticed was 
during winston 's day to day life in his work 
his conversation 
eating in the cafeteria 
etc .
he feels free to look unhappy
and make suggestive glance at person
without immense fear .
one of the most important part of the book 
was that even in small activity it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotion on his face at any moment .
this is also shown in the scene on the street of the proletarion .
in the book winston knew
that this was a huge risk
to wander around there
and was skeptical and frightened at every trip .
while in the movie ,
he does it so often and without fear ,
that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.other minor inaccuracy
included winston hiding his diary in the wall 
yes a very small change ,
but it begs the question ,
what is the point ?
there was also the most annoying thing
a director can do with a book ,
and that is morphing character .
the large inaccuracy were far more disturbing 
however .
first of all 
one of the important piece of the book is
that big brother is a government
based on an intelligent 
yet crude philosophy .
in the movie 
they skip that
and go straight
to making you think
that the government is run by hitler with technology .
which is true 
in a sense ,
when directed with its facism ,
but
if that is all you get out of big brother ,
you really missed the point of the book .
the terrifying thing about big brother is that 
in a way 
it has some point behind its philosophy .
when o'brien is picking at winston mind in the ministry of love ,
he is listening to everything winston says against big brother .
the fact
that he listens ,
and advance forward in his philosophy ,
is in effect
what is most creepy and intriguing .
in the end ,
( careful spoiler ahead )
when winston says
he loves big brother ,
the terrifying thing is that you are not sure
whether it was souly the beating and torture
that caused this 
or the actual power behind the philosophy .
i am in no way
saying
that the big brother 's philosophy has point
that appeal to me ,
but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing .
also 
how could anyone feel any connection between julium and winston in the film ?
it was awful 
no connection whatsoever .
and where was o'brien
before he gave winston his address ?
one of the thing
that carried the book
was winston thought about o'brien
before he made contact with him .
in the movie 
they just jump the gun .
but that about sum up why this movie was a terrible adaption :
because its impossible not to jump the gun and morph character in less than two hour .
how could anyone think
this movie was watchable
if it was under two hour ?
at the very least 
the movie demands 3 hour to be able to capture some of the important mood and connection .
anything less is just pointless.if you loved the book ,
and i mean truly adored it ,
you will not approve of this movie ,
and chance are ,
you already knew
you would not .
because the book is unfilmable ,
and this movie just proves
how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.two star out of ten
