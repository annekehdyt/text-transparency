robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film .
at the beginning i was thinking
that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searcher or jame stewart in the naked spur .
but as the film goes along gilson keep doing more atrocity
until you realize
there is no hope for him .
stewart granger is sandy mckenzie ,
who wants to stop hunting
because he realizes
that the buffalo will soon be gone
and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing .
gilson is a natural killer
who makes no distinction between animal or human being .
dea paget as the indian girl is a surprising character
considering the self imposed censorship of that time .
she lies with gilson in total resignation
even though she hates him .
the last scene of a frozen gilson 
is unforgettable .
