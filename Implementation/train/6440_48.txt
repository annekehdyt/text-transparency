i have lost count
of how many reviews i have written on slaughter high .
i have read a lot of bad
one and i will say
right now this is a fantastic movie .
simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide ,
and even though this was his only film ,
he is what made the movie so great .
at first i did not know anything about simon
until i read a review about his suicide .
then i found out due to the current webpage at www.imdb.com
he was born in 1957 
in dayton 
ohio .
simon may have played the most pathetic character
known to man ,
but his real life self certainly had their strenghth and weakness .
he did a good acting job ,
who can disagree ?
i always wondered
how he felt showing himself naked in a movie .
must have been pretty embarrassing
to say the least .
i first saw this movie
when i was 12 in the sixth grade .
i agree with some pointer like the girl would not take a bath
after somebody was murdered ,
and that high school do not have bath tubs !
i think
caroline munro
who was 36 at the time
was the only other star
that had any dignified acting talent ,
and unfortunately for simon 's death he made no future film .
the reason
( s )
for his suicide are a mystery ,
and hopefully will be discovered in the near future .
doing the math on his webpage
it tells
you
he was 29 year old
when he made slaughter high .
he looked like a teenager .
i give this film two thumbs up ,
the best horror film made .
probably because of their horrible acting the other did not make fame in the movie business .
