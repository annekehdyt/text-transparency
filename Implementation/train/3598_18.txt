i have been known to fall asleep during film ,
but this is usually due to a combination of thing
including 
really tired ,
being warm and comfortable on the sette
and having just eaten a lot .
however on this occasion i fell asleep
because the film was rubbish .
the plot development was constant .
constantly slow and boring .
thing seemed to happen ,
but with no explanation of what was causing them or why .
i admit 
i may have missed part of the film ,
but i watched the majority of it
and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord
without any real concern for anything else .
i can not recommend this film at all .
