ironic
that dr. seuss ' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped 
marketed 
and successful blockbuster of the holiday season .
the general gist of ron howard 's adaptation is that the grinch 's bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident
and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou
who ( played very well by taylor momsen ) .
this movie makes an ardent 
ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss ' story ,
but the end result is a movie
that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jone ' animated version .
jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch ,
but whether it is the dialogue ,
the pacing 
or extraneous storyline heaped upon the initial plot ,
the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly .
there are some wonderful visual
and the make-up work is amazing ,
yet beyond the technical triumphs there is an element or two here
that is missing.succinctness ? soul ?
or maybe jone did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon
that howard falls short of in a movie
that feels three hour long .
howard 
carey 
and crew are all very capable and talented ,
but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product .
if you must see the feature-length version ,
rent it on video with jone ' animated version
and you can see
how bigger and glitzier is not always better .
i give this film three can of who-hash out of five .
