this movie is completely ridiculous .
not only is the plot atrocious ,
but the acting is horrendous .
the special effect are asinine
and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert .
yet 
it is by far the most amusing movie ever
given permission to be produced .
it is 101 minute of laugh due to the fact
that
we all know
there will be no fuel in the year 3000 
or any el camino 's .
there are also other aspect
which i will not spoil ,
just because they are what makes the movie so wonderfully moronic .
i highly recommend this movie ,
just because of its utter idiocy .
i have no idea
who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature ,
but if a good laugh is what you need 
watch exterminator of the year 3000 !
