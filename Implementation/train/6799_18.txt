well you take o.j .
simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver
who decides to rescue his passenger on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide
who does not know what to do but does not want to admit
they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boy
who intend to kidnap an heiress
and leave a busload of person to die on the dessert
and you have got to have action 
plot twist and a lot of drama .
everyone was good
but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boy really blew my mind .
he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy
who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the woman and humiliate the guy
who tried to stop him .
this was evidently long
before he cultivated his good guy image .
and believe
me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jean you really do not want to miss !
