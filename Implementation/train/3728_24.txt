well 
this was one of those film i
caught on the off-chance ,
and it was good enough for me to record
when it showed up next time ...
if 
like myself 
you enjoy many 80 's horror flicks
that anched out a little from the norm
( i.e .
not just another glut of generic sequel )
then i think
you may enjoy this .
when the bad guy eventually turns up in person ,
he was definitely not what i expected to see !
all in all 
i would not go out of your way for this one ,
but if you like the genre ,
then watch it
if it comes up
and you have an hour and a half
to kill ,
i guess .
i would give it 6.5/10 .
