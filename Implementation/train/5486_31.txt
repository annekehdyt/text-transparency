i saw this movie in 1979 ,
i was 17 or 18 ,
when it was released .
the theater was perhaps 1/4 full
when the movie started .
ten minute into the movie me and the friend
who went with me
to see the film
were the only two person in the theater .
the movie was really weird
and had no plot or reason to its script
and person demanded their money back .
we decided to stay for the entire movie ... .
why endure such torture ? ? ...
here is why .
we wanted to be true movie critic ...
to have a standard to base all other movie
on it is hard to justify saying
you have seen the best movie
( a 10 )
they always come up with something better .
but 
it is easy to be able to base all other movie off of the worst movie ever made
( and this is it ... a 1 at best ) .
there may be other movie out there
that truly qualify as a 1 ,
but i have yet to see them .
i now base all movie i see on a scale
based on this worst ... .i
am a true movie critic ...
he he .
