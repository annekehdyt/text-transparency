this movie is just horrible .
it is boring ,
it is low quality ,
the actor are just the worst actor i have ever seen
and the scenario is so bad
that it is hilarious.the `` main '' actor is supposed to be the hot guy
who gets all the girl ,
but he is ugly ,
overweight and looks like he is from the early 90's.all
the character are away for the week-end for a get together amongst friend ,
but nobody are actually friend !
the married couple has not seen the `` main '' guy in over 5 year
and even back then they were not really friend .
the `` date '' of the main guy only knows him from work
and than there is a girl
they pick-up at a bar .
now tell me
that you would risk losing your job
to spend a week-end at your cabin with person
that are not even your real friend .
because that is what he does at the beginning of the movie ! do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon .
i have made home movie scarier than this !
