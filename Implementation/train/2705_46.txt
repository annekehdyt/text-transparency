love it or loathe it ,
it is hard to not find warren beatty 's take on `` dick tracy 
'' the 1990 film adaptation of chester gould 's famous comic strip 
anything short of a genre classic .
superhero film have been coming out of the woodwork in recent year ,
and may soon become a genre all on its own.beatty 's film liberally uses gould 's source material to full effect ,
shooting in all six of the strip 's primary color ,
and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangter and loose 
seductive woman a lush visual style and tone.it can be stated
that the film 's strong visual aesthetic drastically short-change the character and their acting ability ,
which i do not think
can be any further from the truth .
`` dick tracy '' relish in its look and ghastly character 
and beatty himself ,
who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title ,
is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guy at any and all costs.other than the visual treat and oscar-winning makeup ,
there is a plot 
and big boy caprice
( al pacino 
deliciously over-the-top in an oscar-nominated performance ) ,
seeks to eliminate tracy in one well-planned move 
but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gang under him.tracy 
meanwhile 
is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart
( glenne headly ) ,
who as her name would have it ,
remains faithfully by his side and care for the kid
( charlie korsmo ) ,
who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero .
tracy 's fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advance of breathless mahoney
( madonna ) ,
who is also big boy 's main squeeze .
at the same time
that all of this is going down ,
thing become heated
when a new criminal figure arrives in town ,
and decide to play both side against the middle.the performance are good ,
as beatty 's focus on the strained and romantic relationship between each of the lead becomes the center of the material ,
as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effect .
pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role
that is truly standout from the rest .
`` dick tracy '' is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre .
i think
that
if chester gould was still alive ,
he would be proud of warren beatty 's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.8/10
