last november 
i had a chance
to see this film at the reno film festival .
i have to say
that it was a lot of fun .
a few tech error aside 
it was a great experience .
i loved the writing and acting 
especially from the guy
that played the lead role .
there is a lot of heart in this movie 
a lot of wit to .
i got a chance
to speak with a few of the filmmaker
after it was done ,
and they seemed real nice .
all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience ,
and one i would definitely recommend .
the story was entertaining and cool ,
as a woman i have been through a lot of the same problem as the lead guy ,
and i could really understand his problem
because of it .
the movie does a great job
of giving us person
we can sympathize with .
the friend in the movie are really well written to ,
they are realistic .
i know person like these ,
i only wish imy friend and i could sound as cool as these person
when we talk .
the whole movie is just real cool ,
i wish
there were more film out there like it.- jayden
