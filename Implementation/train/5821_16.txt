i watched this movie
when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt .
even he could not make this movie enjoyable .
the only reason
i watched it
until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure
my student never made anything this bad ...
but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though .
it is like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ...
excruciatingly painful.if you took the actual film ,
dipped it in paint thinner ,
then watched it ,
it would be more entertaining .
seriously.if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart ,
back away from it
as if it were a rattlesnake .
