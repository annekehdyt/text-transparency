`` stairway to heaven '' is a outstanding invention of movie
making 
probably never duplicated .
i rank it with `` the wizard of oz '' and `` african queen 
''
although it is a totally different type of movie than `` african queen . ''
`` stairway to heaven '' is a psycho-drama
that uses performance concept and technical effect
that 
to my knowledge 
are totally unique .
for example 
there is the combination of bandw and color footage - as in `` oz 
''
but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple -
but beautiful - effect achieved in `` oz . ''
in `` stairway '' the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.another illiant aspect of `` stairway '' is the concept of `` time ''
and how it is used here .
how could anybody have conceived of a better way
to make time stand still \u0096 literally ?
and then there is the stairway itself !
if you have any imagination at all ,
you will agree with me .
`` stairway to heaven '' is a true gem .
