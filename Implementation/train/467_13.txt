i first saw this movie on mst3k .
and although i laughed my posterior off at the joke 
i do not particularly think
this movie was all that bad .
sure it was a little hard
to understand
it is quite obviously low budget ,
but it had a very hitchcock-like plot
and i can honestly say
that
when i viewed the non-mst3k version 
i was genuinely entertained .
this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake .
