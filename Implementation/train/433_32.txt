i know
many person have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dicken ' story ,
but for me 
this 1984 version is the one to beat .
my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs ,
and we watch it together every christmas eve .
i often remark
that we could watch it on halloween too ,
because it is a very creepy ghost story.scott
-- typecast as scrooge --
is shudderingly mean and nasty ,
making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving .
i think
it is up there with his performance in patton .
the spirit are all effective ,
each one creepier than the last .
watching the dark 
floating 
skeletal form of the spirit of christmas
yet to come send shiver down my spine every year .
and what a supporting cast !
david warner 
in particular 
is in top form as bob cratchit ,
as is susannah york as his wife .
i seem to recall
that this version sticks closer to the original story than most other
-- but i may be mistaken ,
as it is been several year
since i read it .
regardless 
this is a terrific christmas classic .
