maya is a woman
without any interest .
she just dreams her life away and wonder ,
why
she does not feel fulfilled .
this could be an interesting topic .
that would need a good story 
a nice setting and good dialogue .
it does not have any of these .
this movie is totally boring .
there are only lengths
and no climaxes.the only climax is shahrukh khan .
but although i am a huge fan of his ,
i could not stand this movie .
even he can not make this movie exiting .
the movie is not as bad as `` king uncle ''
and if you are an art-house fan or like it slow ,
you might maybe like it .
it is not funny ,
it is not interesting ,
it is not catching .
my recommendation : do not watch it .
