i have seen a couple movie on eating disorder
but this one was definitely my favorite one .
the problem with the other one was that the person with the eating disorder towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact
that they need help and thats it .
this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character
lexi does not automatically just get better .
she gets better
and then has a drawback .
i think
this movie shows more than the other
that i have seen
that getting better does not just happen ,
it is hard work and takes time ,
it is a long path to recovery .
i think
this movie shows all of that very well .
there should be more movie like this .
