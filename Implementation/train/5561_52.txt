in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe .
his girlfriend beth
( dorie barton )
discovers him
and try to commit suicide .
she is institutionalized .
a year later
she is out ,
has a new boyfriend named hank
( joseph lawrence )
and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friend in a big 
beautiful condo in florida .
naturally the killer pops up
( for no reason )
and starts killing again.lousy slasher thriller
-- a textbook example of how not to do a low-budget horror movie .
for starter 
large portion of this film are endless filler of these six idiot videotaping themselves ,
having `` fun ''
( more fun than the audience ) ,
getting drunk ,
acting stupid etc etc .
also there is no nudity in here at all .
i am not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped .
none of the death are really shown
( you hear them ) ,
are only a little bloody
and there is no gore .
there is one real gruesome one
-- but that is not till the end.with a few exception the acting suck .
dorie barton is dreadful
as the main woman and tom jay jone is lousy as oz .
chad allen pops up as brad
and he is terrible .
lawrence is actually very good
-- handsome and hunky
and giving this crap his all .
and jeff conaway pops up in a small role
doing a pretty good job.logic lapse abound
-- after they realize
a friend has been killed two of the girl casually talk about sex ;
baston 's non reaction
to seeing a friend getting killed
is kind of funny
and what happens to lawrence ?
his character disappears
without a trace at the end !
dull 
stupid 
no gore 
no nudity
-- skip this one.rated r for graphic violence and some profanity .
