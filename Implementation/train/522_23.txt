more than just a `` kid ' movie '' 
`` hole '' looks at how past incident still affect us today ,
whether we know about them or not .
when teenager stanley yelnat iii
( shia leboeuf )
gets sent to a prison camp
where he is forced to dig all day long ,
he discovers a number of thing about the camp ,
and his personal connection to it .
through flashback 
we learn
that a number of thing are closer than we realize
( you will understand this better
when you see the movie ) .
leboeuf does a pretty good job ,
as do the other cast member :
sigourney weaver 
jon voight 
tim blake nelson 
henry winkler 
patricia arquette 
and eartha kitt .
a very interesting movie .
