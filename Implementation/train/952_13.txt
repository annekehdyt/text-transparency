un-bleeping-believable !
meg ryan does not even look her usual pert lovable self in this ,
which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick .
hard to believe
she was the producer on this dog .
plus kevin kline :
what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ?
whoosh ...
banzai ! ! !
finally this was directed by the guy
who did big chill ?
must be a replay of jonestown - hollywood style .
wooofff !
