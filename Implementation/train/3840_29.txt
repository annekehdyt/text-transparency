do not see this movie
if you value your mind .
at the end of our collective viewing 
me and my friend estimated
that we each lost 5 % of our ain during its course .
the only person
involved with its making
that was not clinically insane
was the set designer.most movie leave a bad taste in your mouth .
i realize now
that instead of a feeling of revulsion ,
this movie has ed a deep hatred within me .
i hate this movie so very ,
very much.some might say
this movie is not meant to be taken seriously .
if only it did not take itself seriously .
but it does .
the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suit
so prevalent in bad dinosaur movie .
the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless
but often literally painful .
whoopee goldberg is not even trying ,
but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernail on the soul .
and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree
( aka shaft )
as the blustering commissioner ,
you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.i recommend this movie only to anyone
who wishes to see the depth of stupidity
to which mankind may fall .
