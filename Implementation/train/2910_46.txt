'say yes ' is one of those flick
that you keep hoping
is going to get better ,
but it never does .
it is the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decide
to menace an innocent couple ' crapfest 
so beloved of straight to video film-maker .
the dialogue is clunky and 
in several place 
poorly translated .
the acting is uniformly poor 
especially from the villain of the piece ,
played by joong-hoon park .
he seems to think
that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice
he is making his character seem threatening ,
when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.the plot deserves special mention ,
as it is idiotic beyond all belief .
the 'hero ' do not think
it overly strange
that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them .
the 'heroine ' twice manage to miss seeing the villain
when he is no more than a foot away from her .
the villain gets past a police checkpoint
(
while wearing a shirt
covered in blood ,
and a bloody head bandage )
by showing the cop a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car
he is driving .
the villain is punched 
clubbed with a shovel
and stuck through with a pitchfork ,
but never seems to be impeded by these 
rather serious 
injury .
and do not even get me started on that terrible 'twist ' ending .
sheesh.the only plus point in this film ,
for me 
is sang mi chu .
who is very pretty ,
but really no more than a mediocre actress.overall ,
this film comes off like a poorly written 
flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher ' and 'spoorloos ' ,
but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent
in everyone involved .
