i rented this film on netflix
after it won all the oscar ,
to see
if it was really
that good.the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal
( for the most part )
of a group of soldier 's rotation in iraq .
the film center around will james 
a reckless soldier
who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risk ,
and defusing bombs.where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie .
this film has no clear plot unlike other film such as black hawk down .
what this film tries to do is focus more on the character 
and their different attitude about the war .
bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the character ,
but there are many point in the film
where the dialogue seems to drag .
hurt locker is 131 minute long ,
yet it feels like a 3 hour movie.one scene in the movie
that was particularly awful ,
and ruined the film perfect credibility 
was the sniping scene halfway through the movie .
it was both unrealistic 
and very long.overall 
i thought
this film was okay ,
but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7 ,
was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscar .
i felt
like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture ,
but was much better than this film .
another notable mention is black hawk down
which only won 2 oscar .
i honestly do not know
how this won best picture.if you are looking for an action packed war flick 
rent black hawk down .
this film will be forgotten in a year or two .
