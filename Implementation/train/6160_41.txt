fay grim is a true example
of what i call a completed puzzle film .
it has all the piece of acting 
direction 
storyline 
and entertainment value .
they all fit together
and
when done so create a masterpiece ,
fay grim.this film follows a single mother fay grim
trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father
who ran away from the law and went missing .
soon the cia contact fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journal of her husband henry 's .
these journal were filled with confession of his long past in the cia and his involvement with country and their government doing .
fay is sent to find these journal ,
in return to release her other from prison ,
and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe
to recover these journal
and learn of the hidden secret of her husband past
she never knew
about.parker posey had already been an actress i liked
after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show .
she ought liveliness to these two comedic role of her ,
but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movie .
posey made me believe
what was happening on screen ,
i felt for her 
i rooted for her ,
and i wanted to know more .
she grabs you
while she is on screen
and when she is off you can not stop thinking about what is happening to her.i have not seen any other previous work by writer/director hal hartley
but i believe
i will look into viewing some of his earlier film
if they are half as good
as fay grim was.if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time
you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i
would highly urge you to choose fay grim .
if you have any common sense
on how a film should be you
will enjoy this movie immensely .
