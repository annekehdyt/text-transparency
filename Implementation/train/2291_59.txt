bill paxton 
of alien 
near dark 
and terminator fame 
surprises me with his debut as director for frailty .
he hits on all cylinder ,
but there is one implausibility near the end
that involves the fbi agent
( power booth )
which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling
and thought provoking thriller .
other than that 
this movie was just fine.bill paxton plays dad .
he is never given a first name ,
but that is not a weakness of the film .
it in fact strengthens the film ,
allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind .
he has a vision one day
which
he says
was sent from god telling him
that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two son fenton meik
( matt oleary )
and adam meik
( jeremy sumpter )
must fine the demon
and kill them .
the demon look like normal person
which they kill ,
and this makes the viewer wonder
if dad has just lost his mind ,
or is he really doing god 's work .
there are scene
that reflect both point
which adds to the confusion
and gives the film more suspense.the story is told in flashback by one of the son
who is now grown up
( matthew mcconaughey )
and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle
( power booth )
who is very skeptical and rightfully so .
after all it is not everyday
that someone comes in to your office
to tell you
that he knows
who the killer is.the film has many twist ,
and bill paxton direct splendidly
by keeping us guessing
without losing interest .
the acting is incredible .
the two young lead and paxton work great together ,
looking like a normal family
even though they are all involved in murder .
like i said
there is the one implausibility
involving power booth 's character ,
but it really is not a big thing .
this was an extremely well made film
involving faith and family .
