seeing a photo of a man
being attacked by zombie
gave me hope
that lucio `` zombi '' fulci might be up to his old trick .
unfortunately 
other than the close up of a rotting corpse 
there is little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter 's quest to figure out
who killed him .
none of the character are appealing
and by the time
you find out
how they did it
( that twist 
at least 
was cool ) ,
you stop caring .
the only good thing i can say
is that it made more sense than nightmare concert !
