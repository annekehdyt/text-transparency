although well past the target audience 
i have always had a soft spot for ya fiction 
so ,
i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy
drew to the screen.this is not a bad film .
the central mystery
involving a long dead actress
is presented in straightforward simplistic term with dash of jeopardy for the young sleuth .
nancy and her friend never take the threat seriously ,
so young audience member will not be upset.what i really appreciated from the story
was the final result
were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.emma roberts is great as nancy drew
and hopefully we will see her again in another mystery .
