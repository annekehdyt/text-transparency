i think
i have seen all of the grisham movie now
and generally they are all very poor 
except for the rainmaker ,
but this one is so bad
it is unbelievablewarning spoilerishit is one of those movie
where the character does the stupid irrational thing
that no one would ever do .
he is a lawyer for christ 's sake .
why when his child go missing does he not call the polouse .
oh yes it is because all the polouse hate lawyer
so they are just ignore him
and let him be attacked.when he is arrested for murder
they just let him go free ,
he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing .
why would you drag your kid halfway across the country
when you could easily protect them at home.the polouse do
not bother to try and find an escaped mental patient ,
they do not bother to interview his daughter.as for the ridiculous ending .in summary 
silly 
very unrealistic and a complete waste of time.0/10 \u0096 one of the worst film ever made .
