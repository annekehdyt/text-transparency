although i have not seen this mini-series in over twenty year i
can still remember
how the balance between character 
plot and tale of marvelous adventure succeeded .
the use of special effect was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story .
the two version i have seen were dubbed
( english and french )
but the actor appear to speak their own language
not just italian so there is a synchronization problem .
it does not spoil the story telling .
among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north american .
recommended to all follower of odysseus ' ever returning .
