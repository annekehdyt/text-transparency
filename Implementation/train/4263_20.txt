this movie is actually worse
than most movie i have ever suffered through ,
and i have suffered through a lot .
absolute nonsense .
it is got terrible 
forced dialogue ; pointless plot development ; really drawn out 'spooky imagery ' scene ,
which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie ;
5/10 at best attractive woman ; long 
boring sex scene
involving said woman
( forget what you know about virgin !
especially one with lop- sided fake east ) ;
muttered 
difficult to understand speech from some of the character ;
and they actually used the mask from killer klown from outer space during a masturbation scene ,
which should be a saving grace
because that movie was pretty funny ,
but it is not .
veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film .
absolutely give this one a miss .
