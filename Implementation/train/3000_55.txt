it is a refreshing eath of air
when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning 
a middle 
and a end 
a nice 
clever mystery 
with an appealing heroine for all age ,
who wins us over with her wit and charm .
andrew fleming 's film is indeed a modern marvel 
a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling
that was the norm in hollywood .
he puts away the over-reliance on special effect
that now passes for entertainment
and gives us a terrific film ,
with a very capable young actress 
and a talented supporting cast.the film is based on the old book ,
but it has been given updated enough to put in this century ; however ,
the prop might be different ,
the heart still is a good mystery ,
and there is clever one here 
one
that ties the tradition of the old and the nuance of contemporary youth .
emma robert is an old fashioned girl ,
who believes in good behavior and respect for other ;
detail
that are sorely missing from today 's film .
she is still good enough
to get boy ' attention
but she also knows how present poise and self respect .
she earns her medal by working hard
and is not afraid to show a little guile
when it is needed to achieve her goals.while taking a vacation to california ,
our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress
who was the victim of foul play ;
suddenly she is `` visited '' by her ghost and this sets off a series of event
that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself .
what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little detail ,
as she discovers
that her customary world is nothing
compared to the california scene ,
and this is well presented ,
without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language
or anything graphic or overtly sexual .
eventually 
the director has enough control
to make it all very palatable to all type of audience 
from the young one to the adult in the audience .
it is a movie
that deserves to be seen 
appreciated 
and enjoyed 
a film
that is rare and delicate ,
and it is not afraid to be classified as fun !
five star
