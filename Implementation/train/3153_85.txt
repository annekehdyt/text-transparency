believe it or not ,
inspector gadget 's last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing.my name is miriam and i am twelve year old ,
so obviously i was not around
when inspector gadget was at the top of his career .
sure 
i would heard of him ,
but i did not really know him.while reading ,
note
that i never saw the original series
( i would
if it came on ! ) .
this is just about the only gadget thing i have ever watched
( even though i am now obsessed )
and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative .
for all you pessimist 
i have got some con down there 
too .
=p first off 
for a childish sense of humor ,
you could deem this movie pretty funny .
i thought
it was ,
so sue me .
i also thought
the animation and character design were good ,
and i am also happy
there was more gadget in it ,
since he is my favorite character .
( i do not like penny . )
then there was claw
( his voice was awful 
though )
and the madcat ; i thought
they were done fairly good too .
gadget 's idiocy seemed pretty well in place ,
if not a bit exaggerated
( i.e .
sucking his hat-hand thing 's thumb .
would make a good screen shot 
though .
=p ) oh 
and i liked the song
that ran in the credit .
yes 
i am strange.and 
like all movie 
there are some negative 
too.talking car ?
what is up with that ?
you can tell this was aimed at younger boy .
that would not bother me quite so much if
there was not the fact
that the car basically saved the day .
i would have much preferred
if penny and brain had taken their place .
and 
apparently 
gadget loved his car more than would be called natural .
a bit weird ,
to say the least.oh ,
and the chief was downright mean to gadget .
i mean 
sheesh 
yeah 
he was not always the most cheerful of person ,
but he did not hate gadget ,
from what i have read .
like the inspector 
his personality was exaggerated.well ,
that is pretty much all i have to say about this movie .
i thought
the animation made up for the car-centered plot
and that it was overall pretty decent ;
more so than the live-action gadget film
( butchered 
butchered 
butchered ! )
at least .
maybe i am just biased
because this is what got me into gadget in the first place ,
or maybe my mind is twisted ,
or maybe i am just odd ,
but i really liked this movie ,
even if i am the oldest
it is recommended for .
