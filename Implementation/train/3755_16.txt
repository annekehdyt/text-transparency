true 
it does not follow the book very closely ,
but it is still a very entertaining take on the story .
swayze was far better in the role
than i expected .
and doody avoided the `` silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness '' portrayal most of us probably expected
( cf .
kate capshaw in `` indiana jone and the temple of doom '' )
.at any rate ,
it is amazingly better than richard chamberlain 's awful pair of quatermain flicks.it is very reminiscent of a western in many way .
about the only thing i did not care for was all the mysticism ,
but i guess
that is part and parcel of the genre .
like `` how can you have an african adventure story
without witch doctress and preternaturally wise wandering tribesman ? ''
heh .
