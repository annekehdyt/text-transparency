this movie purports to be a character study of perversion .
some reviewer have been gulled into assuming
that
because perversion is depicted ,
the film is psychologically deep ;
actually ,
considering the salacious material ,
it is surprisingly tedious and shallow 
with no motivational substance .
why is the main character
the way
she is ?
you will not find out from the script .
for a better treatment of the same theme
( and a more entertaining movie ) ,
try bunuel 's belle de jour .
