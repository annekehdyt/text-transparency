this film is one of the finest american b-movie of the 90s .
if you are looking for a serious film ,
look elsewhere .
however ,
if you are looking for some action ,
a lot of laugh 
and a tongue in cheek variation on cop fighting gangster 
this is well worth watching .
everyone chews the scenery a bit ,
but that is really what the film is all about ,
and everyone is quite funny .
donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry
and need to do another film together .
