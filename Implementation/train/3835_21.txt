marie dressler carries this depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner ,
which recently aired on tcm during their april fool comedy month .
if you come with the expectation of big laugh courtesy the dressler-polly moran team ,
you will be disappointed ,
as this is really a very downbeat film .
it is also very poorly made ,
surprisingly so considering it came from mgm .
leonard smith 's bare bone cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera
and do not move it ' school 
frequently to the detriment of the cast ,
who find themselves delivering line off screen
( it is like a pan and scan print before such existed ! )
or having their head cut off .
the film does not even have a credited director ,
underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production .
overall 
it is an unsatisfying mess 
with dressler frequently over-emoting
and only that bizarre 
final reel dash to the bathroom
to set it apart .
