kay pollack
( the man behind this movie )
is a real great man
who tries to share his life philosophy in different way .
he has written a bunch of good and well written book
about how to control your sense
and keep your soul happy .
the message in most of his book and this movie 
is about that your thought
in fact is what causes your problem
and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of .
the main message is that you can choose to be happy ,
but hardly ever do that.to watch this movie
and learn something very important on life ,
you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the `` hidden message ''
( or guideline
to get through life )
which most of the part in this movie contains
if you listen and watch .
watch it with your ears.you will not learn the meaning of life ,
but you will learn how to live
and get the most out of it ... so ,
while watching 
please keep in mind : ''
the mind is like a parachute ,
it does not work
unless it is open ! ''
