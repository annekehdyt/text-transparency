this is easily one of the worst 5 movie i
have ever seen .
it is not scary or any of the other thing
suggested in the plot outline .
this movie is agonizingly slow
and i was bored for almost all 98 minute .
while the acting is mediocre at best ,
the biggest problem is the script ,
which is poorly written 
slow and plodding with no real direction .
occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be oken by some useless line or event .
i am not surprised
that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shot ,
they did
after all have to try and digest a terrible script .
as a huge fan of good horror movie 
i am always irritated
that something this bad gets made .
save yourself 98 minute you will never get back .
