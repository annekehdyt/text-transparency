im a huge m lillard fan
that is why i
ended up watching this movie .
honestly i doubt
that
if he was not in the movie i
would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it
but once i did watch
it realize
the story was pretty decent .
a bad ending i must say
but i did see it coming .
it is a low budget movie
and some of the actor were not really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10.the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.its a good rental ! 7/10
