you think
you have had it tough ?
you should check out this film .
carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination .
what this man had to go through
to become a navy diver ,
should be an inspiration to us all .
and significan notly ,
after seeing this film ,
i learned
that what is shown is not even the half of it !
cuba gooding 
jr. does some of his best work to date as brashear .
de niro 
as usual is good as the southern redneck
who trains him .
george tillman in only his second major feature
( after `` soul food '' ) ,
has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker .
if you want to be moved and inspired ,
you definitely need to check out this one .
