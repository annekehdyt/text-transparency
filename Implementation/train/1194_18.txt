the only word
that sums up this movie
is quirky .
it is a light-hearted romp through an existential concept .
bouncy
( in more way than one )
and a bit nutty .
i would not exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema
and it does not seem quite as memorable as the director 's first movie `` cube ''
but it is a good pit of fluff
to watch on a sunday morning .
the acting veer from respectable to annoying at time but i believe
that is how it was to be written .
done as a serious movie
it could perhaps
have been great or may very well
have stepped into a state of pretension .
a little like `` the matrix '' meet `` head '' meet `` human nature '' .6.8 out of ten
