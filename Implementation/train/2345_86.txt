i do not know why person except a lot from low budget indie film
but i enjoyed this one
as i am a fan of urban horror .
there is not too many urban horror movie out there
so
when i saw this one on the shelf ,
just the title alone peaked my curiosity .
so i decided to check
it out and i was surprised ...
it is not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story .
is it low budget ?
yes .
can you tell
that it is low budget ?
yes ... but once you start
watching the movie
you become so wrapped up in the story
that it does not matter .
i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice !
i do not know
what is up with all these bad review for this film .
all i hear is `` worst movie ever '' .
have these idiot seen every movie out there ?
there is thousand of movie out there ,
how can you categorize one as the `` worst '' ever ?
a video not `` movie '' like `` zombiez '' may be the worst film i ever
seen but i can not say
that it is the worst movie
ever since i have not seen every movie out there .
bottom line these person
who gave this movie bad review
are probably from the suburbs .
listen ,
if you do not like minority based 
urban film 
the ghetto film 
hip hop 
etc
then why watch these type of movie ? ? ?
! ! !
knowing
that you do not like this type of stuff ?
sure 
this is a horror film
but it is not just a horror film
but it is an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast .
i do not like tv show like dawson 's creek or the o.c. ,
they suck to me .
film like `` garden state '' 
`` wedding crasher '' and `` i heart huckabee '' suck to me .
i am a guy from new jersey and these show and movie suck to me .
why ?
because i can not relate to them .
they do not peak my interest .
just common sense .
believe me ,
i will never watch garden state 2 :
garden salad 
wedding crasher 2 :
here is a sequel to torture
you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring .
now back to this movie ,
in regard to saint405 's comment above 
i do not know
if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked `` stupid '' by his drunken dad
before he watched the movie but to me ,
everyone did a great job .
the actor
who played ricky
( i forgot his name )
did a very good job .
i am an aspiring actor myself
taking theater at my school and i
had to do a play
where i had to cry
and it is not easy to be emotional in a scene
so i give prop to actor
who have to do an emotional scene
and can pull it off .
anywho 
i liked this movie and never heard of these actor and director
before but you bet i will be looking out for their stuff for now on
and if they are reading this ,
bring on the sequel ! ! !
i am out .
jerzee representin ' !
