enjoyable in spite of leslie howard 's performance .
mr. howard plays philip as a flat 
uninteresting character .
one is supposed to feel sorry for this man ; however ,
i find myself cheering bette davis ' mildred .
ms. davis gives one her finest performance
( she received an academy award nomination ) .
thank to her performance she ings this rather dull movie to life .
**be sure not to miss
when mildred tell philip exactly
how she feels about him .
