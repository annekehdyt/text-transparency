take one look at the cover of this movie ,
and you know right away
that you are not about to watch a landmark film .
this is cheese filmmaking in every respect ,
but it does have its moment .
despite the look of utter trash
that the movie gives ,
the story is actually interesting at some point ,
although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squad ' shower scene and sex scene with numerous personality-free boyfriend .
the acting is awful
and the director did little more than point and shoot ,
which is why
the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience 's attention.in the nutty professor 
a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion
that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer 
wherea in the invisible maniac 
a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion
that can make him invisible ,
allowing him to spy on ( and kill 
for some reason )
his student .
boring fodder .
do not expect any kind of mental stimulation from this ,
and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter
which gets real annoying real quick ...
