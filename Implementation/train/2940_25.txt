seriously 
can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film
without a huge budget :
daniel day-lewis 
ray mcanally 
brenda fricker 
hugh o'conor and fiona shaw ?
there is no doubting that fricker and day-lewis deserved their award :
but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen o'conor
( as young christie )
and mcanally awarded :
the clich\u00e9 is true here :
they do not perform the role ,
they inhabit them .
day-lewis ' performance is a tour de force
- such a transformation
that it is awe-inducing ,
but it was truly a mark of the academy 's intelligence
that alongside this performance 
they also honoured brenda fricker 's beautifully restrained 
still and heart-wrenching work as christie 's mother .
by the way ,
if you have not seen this magnificent actress in `` swann '' ,
that is another film well worth checking out for her contribution
( and the sublime miranda richardson ) .
