this series just gets worse and worse .
poorly written
and just plain not funny !
the premise is excellent 
but the writer 's inexperience shine through .
by trying so hard to offend no one
they end up insulting everyone .
now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arm about 
and resorted to that patronizing 
smug 
`` oh 
silly you '' style acting
that comes with a no laugh script .
they roll their eye
and shake their head at each other
as if to say ,
are not we zany ?
is not this funny ?
well 
no 
it is not actually .
gum disease is less painful .
no wonder 
with the exception of corner gas 
canadians generally avoid canadian tv .
come on cbc you are suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent .
pull the plug on this amateurish mess .
