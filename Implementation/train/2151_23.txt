the premise of an african-american female scrooge in the modern 
struggling city was inspired ,
but nothing else in this film is .
here 
ms. scrooge is a miserly banker
who takes advantage of the employee and customer in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits .
there is no doubt about the good intention of the person involved .
part of the problem is that story 's root do not translate well into the urban setting of this film ,
and the script fails
to make the update work .
also 
the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly ,
the audience becomes tired of it well
before the movie reaches its familiar end .
this is a message film
that does not know when to quit .
in the title role 
the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance ,
and at time line are difficult to understand .
the charle dickens novel has been adapted so many time ,
it is a struggle to adapt it in a way
that makes it fresh and relevant ,
in spite of its very relevant message .
