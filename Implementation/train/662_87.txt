i think
it was ebert
who gave stella four out of four star but 
other than his 
i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class division 
love 
and sacrifice
( three theme most great romantic story or film have in common )
.here the major theme is class division .
stella is a story from depression era america .
that said ,
it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion
that this remake
( if you ask a stanwyck fan or two )
was not exactly appreciated .
fan of the original never gave it a chance .
furthermore 
this version of stella was made in the 1990s ,
not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america
( as the depression was )
.now is the time
to remove the rosy-coloured glass 
in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america ,
and see
that this powerful story still rings true ,
is as timely and relevant as ever 
in its updated format.ye 
class divide is the major theme here .
stella is among the working poor 
single 
with big dream but little hope of realizing those dream .
she works in a bar ,
does not have much money ,
lives in a crummy apartment .
you get the drift .
in the morning 
she does not really want to get out of bed .
on her wall 
picture of movie star
she idolizes.a man
sees her dance at the bar .
he is wealthy 
educated 
from one of those upper class family
that has nothing in common with stella 's .
his major concern is what ivy league college to attend ,
her 's is how to pay the rent ,
how to be 'happy . '
they have an affair .
they like each other .
stella ends up pregnant .
stella tells the guy the news .
his response ?
`` how about an abortion ? ''
she replies 
`` i just wanted a room full of balloon . ''
he supplies the balloon 
and the proposal ,
but she sees his heart is not in it ,
and has too much pride to accept .
she sends him packing.her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyle
-- the love
she has for her mom and the advantage and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father .
stella 
alone and unloved ,
and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday 
makes the ultimate sacrifice .
she gives up the only love and happiness
she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter 
and perhaps live vicariously 
and with hope ,
knowing
that at least her daughter found something to live for.now 
for the movie .
everything is right about it .
beautiful score 
artful cinematography 
great set design
( contrast between the two lifestyle ;
the messy apt .
and the decorated mansion ) 
wonderful and heartfelt performance by the whole cast 
with bette midler 
in particular 
oscar-worthy.this is a film
which is much more significan not and well-made
than you have been led to believe .
