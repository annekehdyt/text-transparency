a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas !
this film is hilarious !
admittedly 
you have to have a taste for film with screaming 
hysterical dialogue 
over-the-top acting 
and melodramatic plot twist .
but if you do ,
you are in for one hell of a treat.sally field
play celeste talbert 
daytime tv 's `` queen of misery . ''
celeste 's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven
( elisabeth shue ) ,
her long-lost niece 
and 
simultaneously 
jeffrey anderson
( kevin kline
- splendid as always ) ,
celeste 's long-ago lover .
but celeste has been hiding a deep 
dark secret ,
and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just ing it to the surface .
add in the diabolical montana moorehead
( a wonderful cathy moriarty ,
in full `` gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode '' ) ,
who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste 's career ; david
( robert downey 
jr. ) ,
the weenie-boy producer of the soap
who 's secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste ;
and 
rose schwarz
( whoopi goldberg ) ,
scriptwriter and celeste 's one true confidant ,
and you are in for a heaping helping of subplot and general chaos.chaotic comedy like this are tricky to execute
( does anyone remember 'mixed nut ' ?
) ,
but when done well ,
can be pretty damn funny !
a major ingredient
that is necessary to any good comedy
is the casting of seasoned pro
who know
that lot of time the funniest thing are not said
but seen in an expression or a look .
field 
kline 
goldberg 
and the rest all work together so well
and are clearly having a great time
that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm .
shue is clearly the weakest link here ,
but she only draws attention to herself
because she is surrounded by field 
kline 
et al .
moriarty is a stand-out in the showy villainess role ,
making you think
of the hottest damn dominatrix
you ever did see ! !
there are also lot of familiar faces
that you will recognize in small
( but 
nevertheless ,
all very funny )
role ,
including carrie fisher 
garry marshall 
kathy najimy 
and teri hatcher .
director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish .
mention must also be made of robert harling 's screenplay ,
carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera .
the dialogue is boiling over with great line ,
delivered illiantly by the actor
( i would be willing to bet
that a lot of this stuff was improvised ) .look ,
if you want to see a bunch of pro
doing what they do best
and having a great time
doing it ,
get your hand on this one .
if not for anything else ,
it will put you in a good mood
and make you laugh !
