john pressman
( micheal 'i shoulda
called ditech ' lerner )
works at a doctor 's office as an orderly .
his mother
( zelda 'poltergeist ' rubenstein )
hypnotizes him to off the person
who see think wronged him .
but this turns out to be a movie within a movie ,
but the line soon blur as john goes a movie theater to kill .
prompting a guy
who 's watching the movie
to do the same .
lerner is suitably over the top in this ,
but zelda repeats line of dialog over and over again .
that gets annoying fast .
but not as annoying as the two girl
who are watching the movie within a movie.as a horror film this one fails ,
it is too busy trying to be clever ,
trying to impart a message
and seems to forget a slasher film
must evoke a sense of tension 
or at least a jump or two .
no ,
what we have here
is the worst kind of slasher :
an art-house one.my grade :
d+
