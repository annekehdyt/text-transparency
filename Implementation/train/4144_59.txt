for all the hoopla 
respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historian ,
it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical area :
action and fight scene .
but i must say
that the plot is probably the best
and most original i have ever seen in a martial art film .
five deadly venom
without a doubt
is a must see 
not only that 
a movie you can watch again and again ;
but i also must say
that
after watching it you feel
it could have been even better .
it somehow leaves you wanting something ,
you want more .
the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice
but does not follow through with giving us more of the action
we want .
the fighting style in the movie really captures the viewer
( centipede 
snake 
scorpion 
lizard 
toad )
and they are shown ,
but battle are noticeably short .
the toad and snake style are particularly intriguing
and should have been showcased much 
much more ,
in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie .
interestingly enough with this movie ,
the absence of constant action or fighting lead to development of a great plot ,
this is one of the few kung fu film
where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome .
this movie has a dark and vicious tone
to it
and you are drawn into the vibe .
sinister weapon and torture tactic are used throughout the movie
and adds to the movie feel .
to start off the movie
and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon .
the ending fight scene are certainly good
but seem muffled
and somehow you expected more .
still
though this movie is one of shaw brother best
and is quite enjoyable .
my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this :
the style the fighter used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail 
sad thing is ,
the director had the good for something extraordinary right at his fingertip
and did not expand on it .
i am left wondering
what could have been with this movie 
still one of the best though .
8/10 on the scale .
