do not bother trying to watch this terrible mini series .
it is a six hour bore 
an unbelievable love triangle between three person
who have absolutely no chemistry for each other .
there is no heat in this story 
no real passion 
no real romance .
it is a dry 
boring 
drawn out 
and uninspired
as they come .
and it does not even meet the expected level of technical proficiency .
take those six hour of your life
and use them for something more worthwhile .
