this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series .
a short lived japanese tv-show ,
that got cancelled
after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show .
this short in the series is 
like all the other film in the series ,
practically without any story .
a group of guy have captured a young woman .
they tie her down and proceed to torturing her to death
while videofilming her .
they beat her 
pour boiling oil over her 
use pliers on her and finally 
in `` loving '' closeup 
push a needle through her eye .
this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movie 
and one of the first .
it was probably this film 
more than any of the other ,
that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff .
they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage 's movie `` 8 mm . `` .
these movie have gotten quite popular in horror circle .
they have progressed to more polished ,
but equally graphic movie like `` naked blood '' .
they probably fill the void left by the mondo movie ,
that got slightly cleaned up
and became reality tv .
not recommended ,
but will probably allure those
who will see anything once ,
and wonder why afterward 
i know i did .
