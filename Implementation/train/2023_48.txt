nyc 
2022 :
the greenhouse effect ,
vanished ocean 
grinding unemployment and scarcity of water 
power and food.. and new york 's population has topped 40 million .
this is a little gem of a picture ,
not least
because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st century citizen .
the low-budget opening title of this movie are great :
set to music 
a low-tech 'tape-slide ' sequence composed entirely of archive still from the dawn of photography right up to 1973 
depicts an unspoiled american pastoral
developing into a polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minute .
succinct and unambiguous 
it is truly memorable .
budget limitation are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraint 
at odd with the story 's illiant premise .
the police station sequence are like an episode of some 70 's tv detective show ,
and the other interior set look basic at best .
the budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise ' the soylent executive 's 'chelsea west ' apartment with state-of-the art goody ,
meaning the other costume are perfunctory ,
some establishing shot are bizarrely underpopulated
and the daytime exterior seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.the memorable scene
where sol and thorn
( charlton heston ) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society : they enjoy real bourbon 
lettuce 
celery 
tomato 
apple 
and beef 
and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else 's wealthy privileges.robinson 's pivotal death scene ,
in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place
called 'home ' ,
depicts him immersed in image of the world 's once-beautiful flora and fauna
as he remembered them ,
beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced thorn 's dawning realization
that the future has been bankrupted ,
among other horrors.this is one smart film ,
and its core message is as pertinent today
as it was in the early 70s .
yes 
i know
we are not eating the dead yet 
but with our resource-sapping longevity 
spiraling poverty gap 
corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change ,
the lasting prediction of 'soylent green ' may come to pass .
