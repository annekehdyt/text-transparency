i do not see
how this show is like the oc at all .
first of all 
the oc center around teenager and their parent trying to get through life .
north shore is about a hotel staff
who is trying to run the hotel
and have a social life at the same time .
second 
the oc takes place in california .
north shore takes place in hawaii.and
why would fox make a show just like one of its other show on the same network ?
i think
this is a great show with good actor for the most part .
it has a good storyline and plot .
i like the event that happen
and how the person take care of them
and work them out .
the most recent episode was surprising
how the story worked out .
it was not predictable like most story on most show .
i hope fox keep it on the air .
