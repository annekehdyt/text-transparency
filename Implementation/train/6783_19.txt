i just saw this recently 
after an interval of nearly forty year .
it holds up well 
especially lionel bart 's outstanding song .
( `` who will buy '' with it
is magical counterpoint 
just one of many standout .
) i disagree with the other post
that decried its g rating .
the rating system 
and new at the time 
never intended the g
( general )
rating to mean `` completely devoid of conflict ''
.characterizing it as unsuitable for kid remind me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz :
a girl arrives in a strange land
and kill the first person she encounters .
she then goes on a road trip with three male companion
and kill again .
