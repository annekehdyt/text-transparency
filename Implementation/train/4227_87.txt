my introduction into yoji yamada 's cinematic world is through his famed and recent samurai trilogy with the twilight samurai 
the hidden blade and love and honor .
i had enjoyed all three film ,
and looking at the prolific 
veteran director 's filmography 
i think
it will take me a very long
while to watch all his film 
especially the tora-san series .
needless to say
when kabei our mother has finally reached our shore ,
i jumped at the chance
to watch what would be an ode to mother everywhere 
celeating their innate love for their child.based on the autobiography of teruyo nogami 
kabei - our mother tell of a close knit family of four \u0096 mother kayo `` kabei ''
( sayuri yoshinaga ) ,
father shigeru `` tobei ''
( mitsugoro bando ) ,
eldest daughter hatsu
( mirai shida )
and youngest child teru
( miku sato ) .
from the get go their life would be changed forever ,
when shigeru gets arrested under the peace preservation law for his morally controversial writing against the nation ,
set in the late 30s where japan had begun their `` crusade '' in china ,
and thereafter their participation in wwii.so begins kabei 's struggle to hold down job
to feed her family 
and the frequent 
difficult meeting with her husband behind bar .
help comes from relative 
especially on shigeru 's side ,
since kabei 's own dad had adopted an `` i told you so '' attitude with her choice of spouse .
shigeru 's one time student yama
( arthouse buff should recognize tadanobu asano here )
provides laughter as a bumbling man
who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the child ,
and kabei 's sister in law hisako
( rei dan )
from hiroshima ,
which
i believe
would have sounded some hindsight alarm bell as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.while the film center
primarily on how the kid are growing up under the presence of their mom 
and in a distant relationship with their dad 
what i enjoyed is how the microscopic family event unfold under the macroscopic worldwide event
that have impacted on the common folk in japan .
it is against the historical backdrop of japan 's push to regional dominance ,
and there are character here
that do not mask those ambition ,
even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered land .
this is something
i rarely see in japanese film ,
being that frank in their discussion of that era ,
and also to get a glimpse
of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issue
made all the more difficult with resource channeled toward the war effort.the actress casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and role ,
be they the veteran or the child actor .
actress sayuri yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure
who has to dig deep and find
that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstance ,
while mirai shida and miku sato are lovable as the understanding child
who have to learn to make do and compromise .
each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching
when the going gets tough ,
or fill your heart with joy should they be celeating .
before long you will soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family 
thank to the primary cast 's powerful performance 
with yoji yamada coaxing some really natural performance from the kid.kabei - our mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction ,
and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moment
without going over the top ,
or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotion
it seeks from the audience .
there are plenty of little thing here done right
which makes it pitch perfect ,
with every scene not being wasted ,
and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across 
be it compassion or love.aside from the very aupt ending
( i had hoped
that it could have continued for a lot more ,
despite its more than 2 hour runtime ) ,
kabei our mother comes highly recommended ,
and you will find it difficult to be holding back either your tear ,
or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifice
she makes for you on an everyday basis .
just what those sacrifice are should you need another reminder ,
then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff
that you would probably have taken for granted .
