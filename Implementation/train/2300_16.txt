this is not masterpiece theater .
you should not go into it expecting that .
this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female lead .
like someone else here said ,
this is the film baby mama was meant to be .
and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it- besides
that it stars the smartest and ightest girl on the planet .
the film is pure silliness on the surface ,
but
if you really watch you will know
it has a lot of message and deep meaning to any of us
who wish
they could go back
and do it all over again in life
knowing then what we know now .
pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minute of great escape .
