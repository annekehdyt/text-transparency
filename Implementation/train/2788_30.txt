judging from this film and the strong man ,
made the same year ,
i would not place harry langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedian .
there simply is not enough there .
perhaps he was on his way
to developing his style but sabotaged himself
by taking his first big success too seriously .
in any event 
all of his trick are reminiscent of the greater funny man ,
but he lacks the acrobatic skill of keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of lloyd .
he also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like chaplin 's tramp character .
his trademark are childlike innocence 
timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity
by looking perplexed 
batting his eye or touching his pursed lip with the tip of his forefinger .
the comedy in langdon 's film result from fate throwing various obstacle in his path
which he tries to overcome in wimpy or na\u00efve way or with a minimum of physicality 
such as throwing rock at an approaching tornado
to drive it away ,
propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulder
by lifting a leg
so
that they roll under him .
in this story 
about the son of a shoemaker
who joins a cross-country walking race
to publicize a rival company 's footwear ,
he manages to win by sheer luck .
there is nothing here
that has not been done far better by the big three .
