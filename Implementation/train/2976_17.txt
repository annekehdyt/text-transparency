i saw this at the theater in the early 1970 's .
the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attack with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time .
the german and their horse are covered from head to toe
( or hoof )
with eerie protective suit .
the experienced british soldier don gas mask
( only )
and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attacker .
the gas clouds move ever closer ,
finally enveloping the british defender .
the german move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb .
suddenly a scream from the defender ... this gas is like no other
that they have experienced before ... .
now you will know
why i have remembered this scene for the last 30+ year and still shiver 
i think
that you will too !
