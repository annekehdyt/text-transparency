the only possible way
to enjoy this flick
is to bang your head against the wall ,
allow some internal hemorrhaging of the ain 
let a bunch of your ain cell die
and once you are officially mentally retarded ,
perhaps then you *might* enjoy this film.the
only saving grace was the story between raju and stephanie .
govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver
and so was the brit girl .
perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapade in india
and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.the
only reason
i gave
it a 3 rating is
because of govida and his ability as an actor
when it comes to comedy.juhi chawla and anil kapoor
were wasted needlessly .
plus the scene at heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest .
being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world ,
anil kapoor would have got himself shot much
before he even reached the sky idge to profess his true love : )
but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic 
gravity 
physic and throw an egg on the face of the *general* audience.watch
it at your own peril .
at least i know i have been scarred for life :
