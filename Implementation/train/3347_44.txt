`` piece is cake '' is defeatist 
revisionist history of the worst kind ,
whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the
( admittedly fictional )
pilot it portrays .
it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.in the march 1989 `` aeroplane monthly '' ,
roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way
that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini-series .
a few of his comment are worth repeating : ''
there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadron
that i saw in action ,
and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'piece of cake ' .
it would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ...
the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club 
though with more discipline .
nor was there any sense of 'death or glory ' .
raf training had insisted
that we were there to defend this country ,
and now we were required
to do it - no more and no less .
`` there was no discussion of 'avery ' or 'cowardice ' .
person
either had gut
or they did not -
but mostly they did .
but we knew fear ,
recognised it in ourselves and in each other ,
did our damnedness to control it ,
and then got on with the job ... '' ... i could feel no 'glory ' ,
but there was a sense of greatness ,
and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake ' .
`` beamont was 
in his own word 
`` a fighter pilot
who 
unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series ,
was there at the time '' .beamont
served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob ,
before going on to become one of the premier exponent of both the typhoon and tempest 
and a post-war test pilot .
`` piece of cake '' is an absolute ,
total misrepresentation of the way
pilot in fighter command acted at the time .
it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace ...
