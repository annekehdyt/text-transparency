a difficult film to categorize .
i was never giving it 110 % concentration and consequently as simple
as the plot appeared i could not say for certain exactly
who was doing what amongst the american fbi character
and what their role were .
nor could i take the irwin seriously as film character
when their line and scene were all in the style of one of his show ,
not acted out.this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show ,
with a largely insignifican not sub plot going on ,
which just seemed to get in the way .
however as any irwin show is always worth a watch ,
this film is well worth a look too 
but not on christma day .
talking of which ,
i have better thing to do too
than be on here.a high 4/10
