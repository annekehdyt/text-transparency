i must say
this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming .
reese witherspoon is so charming and jason london 's not so bad either !
it is so sweet watching dani fall in love
and it eaks my heart and yet warm my heart at the same time watching court fall in love with maureen .
however it is even sweeter
watching how much he cares for dani .
i must admit
though i did kind of want him to fall for dani in the end .
it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart oken so badly .
but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie .
watching him die made me cry for a whole day .
i just could not believe it .
however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then maureen and dani .
they really can make it through anything .
i am giving this movie a 9
because i did not want court to die
but it was still one of the most amazing movie i
have ever seen .
