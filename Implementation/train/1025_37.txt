this was director von stroheim 's third effort -
it is quite crude
and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery
he would display a few year later with his masterwork 
greed and the wedding march .
essentially we have a trio of grifter 
masquerading as a russian count and two russian princess
who have rented a villa in monte carlo .
their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling table
and win a fortune .
part of that plan is for the count
( von stroheim )
to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his `` foolish '' wife ,
wooing her and hoping to gain some money
by playing on her weakness .
he makes the mistake of also taking the life saving of the maid ,
whom he has promised to marry .
when she sees them together ,
she sets fire to the room ,
( von stroheim and his prey are on the room 's balcony ) .
here von stroheim first establishes his persona as `` the man you love to hate . ''
he is thoroughly bad
and his character flaw eventually ing him to a very bad and deserved end .
the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing
unless you are fascinated by the director .
there is a cute bit-
when he first attempts
to meet the ambassador 's wife ,
she is reading a book -
we see the title - foolish
wife by erich von stroheim .
this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film ,
cut down to 140 minute by the studio
and finally released at 70 minute .
the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage
( damaged in some way in most scene )
from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print .
