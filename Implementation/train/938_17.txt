what can possibly said about this movie other than 
`` viewer beware '' .
christma evil should come with a warning label like cigarette do ,
because this was harmful to my eye and ears .
i am rarely this unsatisfied with a `` b '' horror flick ,
but this movie could not even ing a little scare to a five year old .
the point of a relentless lunatic
that has a thirst for blood in a film
is that he/she should seem almost god-like ,
like nothing can stop their maniacal rage ,
but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt
to surprise his next victim
and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus ,
it is a reminder to the viewer
that this man is in no way dangerous
because he is far too stupid to be dangerous .
all in all a total waste of film .
