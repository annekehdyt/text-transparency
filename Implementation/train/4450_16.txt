george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress .
she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune .
he interviews her on her yacht .
they fall for each other in bathing costumes.it turns out
( quite early )
that she is not an heiress .
she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.the movie follows the up and down of their romance.the
supporting cast does little to buoy it up .
davis and brent carry the picture .
though it is fairly predictable ,
it is also fairly entertaining .
it is far from her best .
but ,
especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre ,
it is not one of her worst 
either .
