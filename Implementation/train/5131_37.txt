a murder investigation goes on back stage
while the vanity 
on its opening night 
play on to an unknowing audience .
odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast 
its production number ,
and the sheer novelty of the film.gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show 's star 
kitty carlisle and carl brisson 
as well as starring in the infamous `` sweet marijuana '' number
( which was also on a 70s bette midler album ) .
so while the chorus girl shuffle around backstage ,
bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girl
while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.we quickly learn
that the maid
( dorothy stickney )
loves brisson from afar ,
that the wardrobe lady
( jessie ralph )
is brisson 's mother ,
and that the stage manager
( jack oakie )
butts into everything .
lot of plot twist among the musical number .
the show 's best-known song is `` cocktail for two . ''
kitty carlisle also sings the haunting
`` where do they come from ? ''
and there is a weird rhapsody
that erupts into a harlem specialty number
featuring duke ellington !
quite the cast.some terrific acting here 
especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney .
kitty carlisle is quite good as well .
brisson is a total zero though.charle middleton play homer 
toby wing play nancy ,
donald meek play the doctor ,
and also see
if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girl .
