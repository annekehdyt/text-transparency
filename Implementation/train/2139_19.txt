this is probably the worst movie
ever made
it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it .
i could have understand it in his early year
when he had lower budget
but nowaday there is no excuse
for giving birth to this !
i am a `` b '' movie pervert and from certain person point of view all the flick i love are put aside by `` regular viewer ''
but take my word on this one ,
vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.it is hard to imagine 
vampire with no fang ,
the music score is totally out of place ,
the sound effect are just not effective
and finally mr.savage does not seem to know
he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause
he had a `` not to bad '' career over all .
let me know i'f i am to hard on this one cause
when i do not like a movie i tend
to forget about it is good side .
