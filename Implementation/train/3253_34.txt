this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i have ever seen
and quite possibly the overall worst movie i have ever seen in my life .
the actor and actress were horrible
and it seemed like
they were trying way too hard to play their role as dork 
tough guy 
jerk ,
know it alls 
etc .
and the bigfoot itself was terrible .
it appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the day of atari and intellivision .
at one point near the end of the movie
as an army of sasquatch were chasing after the remaining survivor ,
one gets shot
and as it is running
it looked like a poor man 's version of donkey kong himself !
and one gets hit by a bullet and the blood
that comes out of it
was just awful animation .
another thing
that was annoying
was the music .
way way way too much music
( classical score or whatever
you call it )
throughout the entire film .
it was never ending .
oh yeah 
the movie is boring too .
absolutely one of the worst film i have ever seen .
i highly recommend taking your $ 3
or whatever they charge to rent this movie
and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere .
truly awful !
