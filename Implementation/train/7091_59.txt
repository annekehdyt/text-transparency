first off ; i am a dedicated fan of modesty 's ,
and have been reading the comic
since i was a child ,
and i have found the earlier movie about our heroine unsatisfying ,
but where they fail ,
this one rocks !
well then 
here we go :
ms blaise is working for a casino ,
a gang of robber comes along
and she starts gambling for her friend lives .
if the robber wins one round 
she will have to tell him about herself .
if she wins two time in a row ,
one of the staff member goes free .
( sounds stupid 
yeah 
well 
i am not that good at explaining either.. ) ; )
she tells him about growing up in a war zone ,
without parent or friend 
about her helping an old man in the refugee camp
and how they escape ,
living by nature 's own rule .
they hunt for food ,
and he teaches her to read and fight .
as they approach civilization
they get caught up in a war ,
and
as they are taken for rebellion ,
they are being shot at and the old man dies ,
which leaves her
to meet the city by herself.then
she meets the man
who 's casino
she is now working for ,
and there the story ends .
what is to follow is
that there is an awesome fight
and the line 's are totally cool .
alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise !
just as modest and strong 
graceful and intellectual as the comic-one.feels awkward though 
too hear modesty speak with a slightly oken accent ,
but that is not relevant
since the comic book- blaise can not speak out loud ,
but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent .
( not to mention
that it is weird everybody 's speaking english in the balkan.. )
the acting is really good 
even the child
who personifies the young blaise
must have a applaud !
my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress
to kick the stupid robber 's ass !
totally awesome !
:
d i can not wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/s ! watch it ,
you will not be disappointed !
