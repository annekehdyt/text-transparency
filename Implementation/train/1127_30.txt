as a westerner
watching another culture 's view and tradition of marriag ,
i found just married mesmerizing and delightful .
the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parent is difficult 
especially in this modern age .
yet this is the case in this hindi film .
told with humor ,
and fresh perspective ,
we learn of abhay and ritika
who have only met once
and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon .
as said ,
it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age
that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place .
we see the awkwardness that this young couple feel
as they come together on their first night ,
and how they try to forge a bond ,
even though they do not know one another .
we see different view of marriage and commitment
as presented by the other couple also on holiday ,
from a couple of forty year married to other still unsure
of making marital commitment .
there is song 
witty dialog 
poignant moment 
blending and comparison of new way and tradition .
watching the movie with subtitle definitely loses some of the trueness of the story ,
yet it is still a delight to watch .
granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived ;
however the overall movie was worth watching .
