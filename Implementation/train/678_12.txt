demi moore 's character in the movie was selected for the seal
because of her look .
that was a bad start
and the movie went down from there .
the plot was totally unbelievable .
the will
to make it in a tough military unit
is not enough .
this movie did not convince me of a woman 's physical ability
to perform the type of task required.trying to pretend
that woman and man are basically the same is an insult to everyone 's intelligence .
the difference between the sex are what makes life interesting .
