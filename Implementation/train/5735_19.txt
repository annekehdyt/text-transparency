i loved this film
when i was little .
today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated film .
beautiful animation and appealing character are just two of the thing to like about this film .
although many person might not enjoy some of the song ,
most of them are well-done and go along with the story .
it focuses on charlie 
a roguish handsome german shepard
who may seem unlikable to some at first ...
but eventually will win you over.not a kiddie film by any mean .
often very dark and frightening at time .
a treat for don bluth fan and animation buff .
but do keep a tissue in handy .
adgth never fails to make me cry
and will do the same for those
who are movie sensitive .
arguably one of the greatest non-disney animated film of all time .
along with watership down and my neighbor totoro.bottom line :
a heavenly masterpiece .
