i went into watching this movie
knowing
it was not going to be great .
but what i witnessed was to awful for word .
i do not mean to be harsh ,
its just the movie was terrible .
overall it had bad ,
i mean awful special effect ,
the acting was not too bad ,
but was not good either ,
and sasquatch himself was like ... . well 
not sasquatch .
in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the henderson .
its not violent or horror ,
but it has the best depiction of sasquatch .
at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off .
only see this movie
if you are desperate ,
or really appreciate anyone in the film .
or go watch boondock saint ,
it is much better .
