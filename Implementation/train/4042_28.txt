original claymation rudolph :
pretty good .
original frosty cartoon :
needs a little work ,
but could be worse .
but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july ?
c'mon !
give me a break ! ! !
this was one movie
that should not have been made .
it was bad .
it did not really go for any holiday in particular 
except july 4.
that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph
are usually associated with the christmas season .
and any movie can be ruined by too much singing .
the frequent song made this movie seem a lot longer
than it really was .
the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime character with an american traditional holiday
( which almost seems to `` limit '' it to america ) ,
too many pointless song 
and a lousy plotline .
the result ?
a bad movie
that can not really
be watched at any time of year .
i would suggest you forgo this movie
even if you like frosty and rudolph .
