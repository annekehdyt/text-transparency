this is just the best movie of all time !
sorry 
hollywood !
i have seen it in early 70 's ,
as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv ,
and i loved it immediately
( i was 14 then ) .
25 year later i bought it on a video tape ,
and a few month ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria .
i live with this movie 35 year already ,
and so do all my friend and my family .
my son was a teenager
when he saw it for the first time ,
and he loved it immediately ,
too
( and this is the generation
that grew up
watching practically only hollywood movie
and not speaking or understanding russian at all ! ) .
what makes this masterpiece of danelium so special ?
it is difficult to say ,
as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is ...
but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of time with the same pleasure
as it was the first time .
i can not remember any other such movie ,
no matter how many million it cost
or how great the cast was ... chapeau 
maestro danelium !
bulgaria loves you !
