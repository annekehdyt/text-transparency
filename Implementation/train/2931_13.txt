i knew
this film was supposed to be so bad
it was funny ,
so i went into it with that expectation .
i just found it to be so bad
it was murderously boring .
the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 second ,
until you realize
there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality .
seeing thing get splattered with tomato gets old in about 30 second .
there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise .
it could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe ,
but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination .
