this is a delightful movie
that is so over-the-top
that my wife 
daughter 
and i found it irresistible .
the plot is just crazy but `` ring true '' to the world of soap opera in all its outrageous improbability and impossibility .
i particularly enjoyed kevin kline 's and sally field 's performance .
i do not anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded .
field 's character 's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation
-- and her almost bipolar swing in mood --
played nicely against the background of field 's famous
( infamous ? )
`` you like me ! ''
oscar exclamation .
person
who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt
are all too rare in this world .
i think
this is the only movie
where i did not find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization ;
i thought
she was `` spot on '' in every note
she struck .
robert downey jr. 
teri hatcher 
cathy moriarty 
and elizabeth shue were also first-rate as well .
just a great movie
if you are in the mood
to go along for the ride and laugh !
