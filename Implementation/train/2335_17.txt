this is a comedy
based on national stereotype ,
no doubt .
if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russian or brit are ,
if you accept
and are not hurt by the convention ,
you can have fun with this film .
nicole kidman is at her best 
sexy 
moving and funny .
ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole ,
and the rest of the cast does good work as well .
the final is moving ,
and logical - movie logic 
of course .
worth watching ,
if you accept the rule of the game .
