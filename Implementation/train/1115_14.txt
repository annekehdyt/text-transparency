the thing
about calling `` house of the dead ''
the worst movie of all time is that it is really not .
there are worse movie out there .
i watch alot of hong kong ninja movie
that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese polouse drama
having footage of ninjas
inserted at the end
to create something
that could technically be called `` a movie .
`` house of the dead is however one of the worst film i have ever seen at the theatre .
walking out half way through ,
i actually felt
i was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minute of this piece of garbage .
