i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival
and it seriously makes me wonder
if the folk at the festival actually screen the film
before selecting them .
the film was simply awful -
i say
that
without hyperbole or ulterior motive -
it was awful .
matthew modine 's day as a leading man are way over .
gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent -
she should be ashamed of her participation in this film .
gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it -
she should also be ashamed .
the script was terrible
and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the character .
i highly doubt this will be picked up ,
but then again ,
person in hollywood are known to make mistake sometimes .
i really think
`` kettle of fish '' is a serious contender for the worst movie i
have ever seen .
