this is another north east florida production 
filmed mainly in and near by to fernandina beach and the kingsley plantation .
i was rather surprised
the company was able to take over the main street of fernandina beach
as long as was necessary
to achieve the street scene .
the film is pretty 
and pretty bad .
tami erin is cute 
but overact .
eileen brennan overact even more .
good for small kid 
or for those
who like fluff in large dose .
a 4 from the miller-movie formula .
