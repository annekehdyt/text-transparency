after some of the negative review i heard on this movie ,
i was doubtful of giving it a go ,
but i had \u00a33.99 in my wallet
and thought id gamble
on buying a budget like movie
and saw this
and gave it ago and i am glad i did ,
i enjoyed it .
directed by the star of film such as chain reaction 
the ring 
bourne identity ,
( brian cox )
i had to gamble with this
even if it was rubbish
but it were not at all ,
i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider-man 2 the character doc ock .
he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film .
of course like many other person
which bought this movie i
saw matthew 's name ,
and that made me get it !
and no his part is not big at all ,
it is very short at the very end of the film ,
it is not a big part
which makes me believe
that why person
hate the film .
i suggest
you give it a go .
some part are a pit poor
that needed polishing 
the acting 
and a bit more action .
but it is watchable .
