will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time .
just plain torture.i would rather choose to watch 90 minute of my computer going through 5400 blue screen of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever .

well
that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport.my ain hurt from trying to work out

of sitting through the rush .
made for tv should not be a synonym for :
`` sure 
let the horse bowel run loose across the living room !
our audience are idiots !

folk .
hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.i should be ashamed for watching it.i am ashamed .
i am off for a long shower .
