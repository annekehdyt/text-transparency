girlfight is like your grandmother 's cooking :
same old recipe
you have tried a million time before ,
yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new .
try and explain the story to person
who have not seen it before :
a young woman from the wrong side of the track attempts
to improve her situation
by taking up boxing whilst
dealing with a bitter 
obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival .
watch them roll their eye at the string of clich\u00e9s ,
and they are right :
it *is* clich\u00e9d .
yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works ,
due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue 
and sensitive direction
that makes it 'new ' .
i avoided this at the cinema
because it looked like complete crap
but do not make the same mistake i did .
definiately worth a look .
