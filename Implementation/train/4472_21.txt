i could not wait to see this movie .
about half way through the movie 
i could not wait for it to end .
all of the ( white ) actor were delivering their line like woody allen
had just said ,
`` say it like this ... ''
then they said
their line on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen .
it was so annoying .
we all know
how will ferrell really talk ,
and he does not stumble over his word like mr. allen .
the comedy portion of this film was just as boring
as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining .
i must admit
that i have never been a major woody allen fan ,
and this movie definitely has not converted me .
i think
that his writing was just as bad as his direction .
this movie will go down
as one of the worst 10 movie i have ever seen .
