let me start out
by saying
this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george :
narrator :
huh ?
wait a minute !
who the heck are you ?
george :
me new george .
studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser .
narrator :
how did you get the part ?
george :
new george just lucky ,
i guess .
sadly ,
that is the only funny part in the entire movie.it was still entertaining ... but then again ,
i am easily entertained ... i would not say
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
( that title goes to the terribly un-funny disaster movie ... ) ,
this movie falls # 7 on my bottom 15 list ...
if your a small child
who is easily entertained ,
you will enjoy this movie .
if you are a movie-watcher
who wants a good 
funny movie ,
you will end up shooting yourself halfway through this one..
