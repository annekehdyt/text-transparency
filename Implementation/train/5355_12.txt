very possibly one of the funniest movie in the world .
oscar material .
trey parker and matt stone are hilarious
and before you see this i suggest
you see `` south park '' one of the funniest cartoon created .
buy it ,
you will laugh every time
you see it .
pure stroke of genius .
if you do not think
its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor .
10/10 .
