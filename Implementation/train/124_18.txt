best stephen king film alongside it ,
though this one is more fun than scary .
this one 's got it all :
-a great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king himself ;
-well dosed horror in an amusing storyline ;
-great use of music 
santo and johnny 's `` sleepwalk '' in particular ;
-likeable character in a typical king
setting :
middle of nowhere village ; -lot of humor .
you can not really get good scare here
because it is too much fun and over the top ;
-old but really nice makeup effect
like they do
not make anymore ! a 4,5 rating :
i do not get it really .
when was the last time
a horror film was as much fun as this one ?
