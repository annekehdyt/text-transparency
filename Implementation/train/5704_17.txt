fever pitch is a fun enough movie .
it has a lot of funny moment
( including a hilariously disturbing shower scene ) .
like most romantic comedy 
it has a `` dead zone '' in the middle
where all the heavy 
`` she is eaking up with me '' stuff happens ,
but other
than that it continues to be funny until the end.even
though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox ,
it is not overloaded with sport .
you do not have to be a fan
to enjoy this film.of course
that is easy for me to say :
i have been a red sox fan since i
was a boy 
too.7/10.barky
