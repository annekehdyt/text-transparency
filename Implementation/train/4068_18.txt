i had suspicion
the movie was going to be bad .
i am a duke 's fan from way back .
have three year of the tv series on dvd .
well i was right .
took the family
to see it .
i really wanted to see the general jump again
and some of the chase jump scene were good .
but to sum it up ,
the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show.jessica simpson was pathetic .
while i can honestly say
that the original daisy 's outfit were just as revealing ,
jessica simpson 's interpretation of daisy was simply awful .
sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their grave
as well.do not waste your money .
if you are an old tried
and true duke fan like me and my three kid are you will be very disappointed .
