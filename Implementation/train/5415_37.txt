trawling through the sci fi weekly section of the local video rental store i was losing hope
of finding any good movie i had not yet seen .
renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse .
my son is so jaded with current `` b '' science fiction
that he has not bothered
seeing this yet.it must be noted
i did not see anything about cypher
when it was released in australia .
it must have been very quiet or i
just missed it.well this was a really pleasant surprise !
this is also no b movie .
it is not a `` blockbuster '' of the epic variety
and does not try to be - more a quiet movie
that needs to be seen several time
for it is plot to be fully savoured.the special effect
are powerfully presented
when they are used -
my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view ,
but they get it right at it is 2nd appearance ,
and that aside everything else is top notch .
in any case
the affect are secondary.i
will not give anything away about the plot .
the plot structure has a russian doll
aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct
( though with very different content )
.just i will say
that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke .
the actor was born in camidge england ,
and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect ,
it is a tad off key .
see the final twist of the plot and you will see why
that is such a illiant choice !
and lucy liu is also just right with her `` will
she kiss me -
will she shoot me '' edge.i rarely watch movie several time
within day - this is one of them .
