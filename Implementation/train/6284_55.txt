i am marking this as a `` spoiler ''
only because of some of my comment of the show 's content 
not to the content itself.as i read the comment
it is apparent that those republican somehow tolerate the show ,
but disdain it ,
while the democrats seems to relish in its so
called truthfulness .
one reader even
( so it seems )
actually indicates
that he believes
these event did or could have happened
when bush was in grade school.but as to the content as i see it ,
trying to be neutral ,
is that the group
that made this series
must actually be really bush hater .
in the episode
that i saw last 
s02e03 ,
it showed
that the program must have been put together long
before mccain became the front runner for the nomination ;
because 
the other former front runner are all featured.another thing
that caught my attention ,
was the use of add in closet .
i thought
that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the u.s.a. ,
because i know of no home the u.s.a.
that does not have built in closet ,
and most likely in the home of the artists.as i watch the show 
yes i do get caught up in it ,
i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writer
to do what they can to embarrass our president .
sure there are problem
as most american will agree ,
but that is no reason to be so hateful in public display
seen around the world .
perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network ,
so that
if obama or hillary got in ,
would they continue to produce and air the same sort of `` humor '' about them ? just one more comment on a commentator 's remark .
if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 ,
according to that writer ,
he was so sure
that there would be a completely different acceptable president .
wow 
wishful thinking on his part .
as far as 911 event ,
i do believe
that it was set in motion back
when clinton was president ,
and i can not see
how if gore was president anything would be much different .
