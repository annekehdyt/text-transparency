this a fascinatingly awful movie .
it make so little sense
that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own .
well 
it would
if it did not keep darting off up side-alley until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness .
the movie can not make up its mind
whether it is a straight forward 'man
turns into monster ' flick
( like all those 1950s 'the incredible insert verb ing man ' movie ) 
or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie 
or a mystical afterlife contact story 
or ... or what ?
take your pick .
it is just a mess .
grotesquely over the top
and firing off in all direction ,
leaving loose end flapping all over the place .
it was as if tobe hooper had been taking david lynch pill .
unfortunately he did not take enough .
