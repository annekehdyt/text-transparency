sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it \u0096
and still it is not easy to explain
why i liked it that much .
this is mostly true for the uncommon movie
\u0096 the one one can hardly compare with the rest out there .
goodnight mister tom is one of these special movie .
there is a lot of emotion
in that movie \u0096 and the acting was so good
that
while watching the movie ,
i was crying and laughing
as the story went on .
the young nick robinson \u0096 is a young boy
( william )
evacuated from london
because of the air strikes there during the second world war .
mr. tom
played by john thaw
is an old man
leaving in the village the evacuated child
were send to.at first tom refuses to take any responsibility -
such as taking care for a troubled young lad \u0096
but accept
since he is left without a choice .
during the stay mr. tom discover
how horrible the life has been for the william \u0096 alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instruction to the host of her son \u0096
not to hesitate to use it .
this belt is berried in the field \u0096 never to be used in such a utal manner .
mr. tom provides a real home for william ,
and the boy is happy with his new life ,
he goes to school ,
makes new friend and discover hidden talent .
all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter
mentioning
that she is not feeling well
and it starts all over again \u0096 only this time
it gets much worse
there are many feeling
you can sense in this movie \u0096 love 
fear 
sadness 
happiness 
pain 
hope \u0096 and much more .
goodnight mr. tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with other such as dear frankie and billy elliot \u0096
if one is to compare .
i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it .
before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of zac \u0096 reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood
