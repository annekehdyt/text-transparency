this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast 
and many memorable scene .
the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accent .
the spanish character in the film are played by a frenchman
( boyer ) ,
a belgian
( francen ) ,
a greek
( paxinou )
and a hungarian
( lorre ) !
and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat !
despite these absurdity ,
the performance are all very good - especially those of paxinou and lorre .
but the scene
in which boyer 
paxinou and lorre meet ,
and talk in wildly different accent 
is a real hoot !
and i guess ,
seeing as how they were alone ,
that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway !
it seems pretty weird
that the brother warner could not find any spanish speaking
actor in los angele !
of course hollywood has often had an `` any old accent
will do '' policy - my other favorite is greta garbo
( swedish )
as mata hari
( dutch ) ,
who falls in love with a russian soldier
played by a mexican
( ramon novarro ) .
maybe they should have got novarro for `` confidential agent '' -
he would have been great in boyer 's role or at least in francen 's
( which would have saved greatly on the dark make-up budget ) .
