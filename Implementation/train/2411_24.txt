nothing happens.then character with no personality do not develop.then the end
never comes
because there is no beginning
and no middle.there are beautiful shot
that are made not beautiful
because they are not even allowed to be ,
because this movie is not even there .
there is no `` is '' in this movie
because there is no plot or character or theme or idea or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point .
there is nothing !
there is a good point :
it has a good soundtrack .
but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such
that
watching it is not even worth your time ,
so
if you are really interested ,
i would suggest going
and buying the soundtrack or something .
you will get everything you can from this movie
without all the fatigue 
headache 
and impatience. --
