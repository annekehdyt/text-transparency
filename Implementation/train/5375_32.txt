i consider this movie a masterpiece ,
but it took me at least 4 o 5 time
to see it ,
so as to realize what a great movie it was .
first 
it describes a face of ww2
that we do not usually see in hollywood movie .
in particular 
german soldier 
army and the nazi government are shown more `` humanized '' .
one of the fact
that impressed me most
was the mention 
by the end of the movie 
of a murder
that took place in a forest in the last 20 's ...
that forest is the place
where the final chapter of berlin alexanderplatz take place :
those are the wood where reinhold kills mieze .
another clue for those
who like the detail ,
is the representation of door .
fassbinder is obsessed with the change in person
each time they walk across a door ,
or a door is opened .
many door are shown in the screen ,
opened and closed .
and the character change in their personality 
their act 
etc any time
that happens .
have you noticed that ?
