a young woman
( jean simmon )
is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt
( sonia dresdel )
and uncle
( barry jone )
that she is losing her mind and in very delicate condition
that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation ,
as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible .
the only other person
she sees
is the estate caretaker 
a lascivious character
played by maxwell reed ,
whose caught the wayward eye of the middle-aged aunt .
all of this 
the aunt and the caretaker 
the butterfly expert uncle
who has a serious underside to him ,
and the susceptible niece in the middle ,
would have made for a darker and more sinister film .
as it is 
a frame-up for a murder sends trevor howard
( a fired government secret service agent
who took a job at the estate cataloging butterfly )
and simmon across the countryside escaping polouse 
catching headline of `` polouse net closing in '' over her front page photo 
hopping on bus ,
and winding up in liverpool ,
where they meet some wonderfully cast character ,
and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle .
