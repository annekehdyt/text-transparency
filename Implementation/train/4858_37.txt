this is a film
that on the surface would seem to be all about j.edgar hoover
giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansman ,
going after indian killer 
hunting the famous gangster of the 1930 's 
fighting nazi 's in the us and south america during world war 2 and commy in new york during the early 1950 's .
of course in 1959 we did not know about mr. hoover 's obsession for keeping secret file on honest american 
bugging person like the rev .
martin luther king 
jr 
but worst of all 
his secret love affair with his deputy director 
clyde tolson
( if you want to know more about that subject ,
i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn ) .
hoover aside 
this story of a life in the fbi
as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent ,
but dated film .
vera mile as his devoted wife is also good .
but jimmy is the movie .
as much as hoover controlled production
and always made sure
the fbi was seen
without fault ,
jimmy stewart gave the film a human side 
quite an achievement
considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder .
the background score is also pleasant .
i have read recent online article
suggesting
that this is a forgotten film .
jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film star of all time
and none of his film should be forgotten .
tcm was the last network
to show it a long time ago and i hope
they show it again .
