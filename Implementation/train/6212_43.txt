the fourth `` tremor '' feature goes back in time 
to the year 1889 .
`` the legend begins '' in the small city of `` perfection '' ,
which was then `` rejection 
nevada '' .
as the story begins ,
seventeen miner are killed by the ghastly `` graboid '' .
some of the character in the present-day `` tremor '' film have ancestor 
both figurative and literal 
in the past .
most obvious is the ever-returning michael gross
( as hiram gummer ) .
unlike his descendant 
mr. gross is inept with firearm ; so 
he hires gunslinger billy drago
( as `` black hand '' kelly )
to shoot 'em up some `` dirt dragon ''
.this one takes some getting used
to -
as it takes place in the distant past .
it is like a western with miniature version of the original film 's monster `` graboid '' .
these tamer `` dirt dragon '' are nowhere near as terrorizing as their `` tremor ''
( 1990 )
counterpart .
consequently 
in this film 
the character spend an awful lot of time on the ground ,
which would not have happened in the original movie .
and 
it was weird to have the citizen give up the fight so quickly ,
when gross temporarily decides to leave town .
why so helpless ?
why did not brent roam
( as juan pedilla )
immediately rally the person
to fight without gross ?
disappointing .
