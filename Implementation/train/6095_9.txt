the movie was sub-par ,
but this television pilot delivers a great springboard
into what has become a sci-fi fan ideal program .
the actor deliver and the special effect
( for a television series )
are spectacular .
having an intelligent interesting script
does not hurt
either.stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite program .
