... except for jon heder .
this guy tanked the entire movie.the plot sounded entertaining .
a 29 year old slacker son
( heder )
still lives with widowed mom
( keaton )
who happens to meet a new love
( daniel ) .
slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life
and try to sabotage the relationship .
he also meets a girl
( faris )
.i really liked the performance of daniel and especially faris
but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dog at the beach .
heder performance is annoying ,
which would be a good thing
since he plays an annoying guy ,
problem is he is to bad an actor
to loose this act
making this guy likable in the finale .
at the end you still wish
you can personally punch the guy in the face
and you are upset about the end .
in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me !
