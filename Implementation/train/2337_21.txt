what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyre ,
i thought
i have to get the other movie this guy
( larroz )
has made ,
i was sorry i tracked this down ,
it is a weak attempt at an occult/satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex
( with ugly actor and actress ,
this is an excuse for sleaze .
the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere ,
avoid this one 
too much hype surrounds it ,
not worth the effort
of finding it ,
this refer to the welcome to the grind house edition .
i hope
he has some other movie
which lives up to vampyre ,
oh and the goat scene was very boring ,
i understand
that this is what carries the hype .
