first of all the movie 
is an ingenious work of art
( movie ) .
the plot was filled with surprise 
a little kid pretends
to be a grown up inherit one million dollar
and how he spends it .
i mean how whacked out is this .
walt disney really outdid themselves this time .
the comedy is most of the time expected but the other time unexpected .
i mean was this movie ok
or was this movie ok.
it also teaches a lot about wise youth and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pant .
but also it sucks .
how the heck could a guy
like that kid get a hot police babe
and his dad let him go free .
that is like let a killer get bailed free for ten year .
if i were to do
that i would get beaten with a 'suble jack '
( a huge stick
that stings
when used to bench your butt really hard ) .
that kid is really lucky .
back to the story .
the movie maker really knew
what they were doing
when they made this movie
but still it is not perfect .
the acting was good and bad .
the kid and woman had no chemistry
neither did the father
but the os were excellent ' .
the special effect on the other hand was lame .
plus this movie is not based on reality .
i hated and loved it at the same time .
