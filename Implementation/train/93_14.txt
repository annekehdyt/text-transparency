`` a total waste of time '' just throw in a few explosion ,
non stop fighting 
exotic car a deranged millionaire 
slow motion computer generated car crash and last but not least a hugh hefner like character with wall to wall hot babe ,
and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie .
