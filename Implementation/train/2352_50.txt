having developed a critical eye for film ,
and a love for good cinema 
i went to see antwone fisher with my eath symbolically held .
while i am an unabashed fan of denzel washington - both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona ;
i am an honest enough fan
to admit the ( very few ) time
when he has not quite hit the mark in a film or two .
and i could be wrong about those - after all ,
i am not an actor .
but this was different - denzel would pour his career 's experience into 
and guide 
a film
handling one of the most sensitive topic
known to man
- the abuse of a child .
as his directorial debut 
no less .
and develop the film to point
that it would successfully present the triumph of a man .
i did not want to be disappointed.and i
was not.what i did see is a film full of promise
that
connected diverse audience ,
and gave the inexperienced viewer a ief ,
but truthful eye into the life of a young man
whose childhood was a living hell ,
but who triumphed despite it all .
this film did it -
and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it .
it takes someone to know the topic in this film
to know
when truth is presented .
it takes a talented filmmaker
to tell you the story convincingly
when you have not experienced it .
and if he can further draw an audience in ,
and cause an audience to emotionally respond ,
without pity 
the filmmaker has done his job .
in any film .
black 
white 
purple or polka dotted .
that is what makes good cinema .
bravo 
denzel washington 
derek luke 
joy bryant and most of all 
antwone fisher -
you have indeed won .
