i am ,
as many are 
a fan of tony scott film .
when this movie came out i had high hope
that it would be like 'man on fire ' .
to find out
that the movie it is the furthest thing from it !
the story was treading water from the get go ,
and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea .
and the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous !
the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly 
and this movie reveals
that she will never become a movie star !
the movie ought some of the worst acting ever.i like tony scott 's direction 'n all ,
but this takes the whole friggin cake !
sorry ton 
1/10 !
