at the end of the movie i still do not know
whether i liked it or not .
so was the case with most of the reviewer .
but none the less i still feel
that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of effort
put in .
long ago i read a quote :
there are 2 kind of writer 
1. those
who think and write .
and 2. those write
and make the reader think .
while here i feel
that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience.i felt
that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devil advocate and fight club ... .it
is definitely a classic :
something which no one understands but appreciates ... .what i do not understand :
why stathom
( jake green )
had a blackout
( thats how it all began ) 
all the riddle and mystery in the movie have been taken care of except this one.well
if you are reading this review
to find the solution
as what this movie was all about :
i will post the very midnight
it strikes me
and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not :
then answer this first ... .
when you come across a puzzle labeled
as 'no one has ever solved '
would you like to try ?
i would
