i thought
that mr. dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator .
his co-star 
mr. julia 
played his role equally as perfect .
it was interesting to see how reluctant richard dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will .
but he became more confident and comfortable with the role
as time passed .
since everything happen for a reason in life ,
i believe
he was forced to replace the dictator
because he was meant to stay there for over the year
that he did .
i am guessing
that he stayed
because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in parador .
i think
he took too many thing for granted in life
and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did.but ... ... ... .. anyway ... ... ... .. this is why
i gave this film a 7/10 .
