what is that there in the sky ?
is it a plane ?
is it superman ? ?
errr 
no it is a turtle ! ? !
see 
that is what becomes of the cold war !
nothing but bad news and other issue !
the american shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrost
and literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle-creature
named gammera .
he/she is not a very friendly critter
as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path .
the arguing government finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a and new and super-sophisticated ice-bomb ,
but gammera has another surprise in store
the damn turtle can fly !
the first time this happens result in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence !
gammera lies on his back looking defeated
when suddenly fire blow from his armpit
and he skyrockets himself up in the air .
how can you not love that ?
then there is also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid
who 's able to telepathically communicate with the monster ,
but that is just not interesting enough .
flying turtle 
person ! !
there is very little else to write about this japanese
( and american re-edited )
sci-fi effort 
apart from that it is an obvious and totally shameless rip-off of such classic like the original godzilla and the beast from 20.000 fathom .
the effect and monster design are extremely hokey
and 
unlike the aforementioned film 
it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance .
respectable actor like brian donlevy
( `` the quatermass experiment '' )
and dick o'neill
( `` wolfen '' )
seem unaware of what film set
they are on
and even the original japanese mayhem-scene are not very convincing .
gammera 's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool 
though ,
so it gets one extra point for that .
