saw this movie the first time
while drunk at a motel in canada .
while flipping through channel came across the easy lube part .
my friend kept flipping but i told him to go back .
something about the name easy lube just did not sound right .
watched the rest of the movie
it was pretty damn funny .
jotted down a couple of name from the credit
and got home
to look it up .
turned out to be chevy chase 's first movie .
i did not remember him in it .
did not remember much about it ,
so i rented it
and gave it a second veiw .
it is pretty funny and quite graphic .
it is just like kentucky fried movie except not as funny .
love the finger 
easy lube 
and i am da f**kin ' president part .
dealer skit is pretty cool too .
i give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
