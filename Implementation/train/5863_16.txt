this movie was poorly written ,
poorly acted and very predictable .
it was very low-budget and i can understand
why it was never released
and went straight to video .
it was not even campy fun ,
it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the 1-1/2 hour back !
the color were horrible along with the plot
which has hole so big
in it you could drive a mac truck through them .
the plot itself had the young ide doing thing
that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing
-- what a stretch !
skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre .
just about any movie comes to mind
that is better than this.ejames6342
