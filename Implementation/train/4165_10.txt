serious home alone/karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotype to have the writer sued and then shot .
you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene .
oh 
and the acting sucks too .
although i must say
that the line :
`` sorry 
dude 
i have to take a major dump big time ''
made me laugh my ass off .
