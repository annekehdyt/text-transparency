yes 
this gets the full ten star .
it is plain as day
that this fill is genius .
the universe sent trent harris a young 
wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape ,
in all that true misfit glory
that you just can not fake .
too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man ,
if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow 's story .
the other two step in the trilogy do retell the story 
with sean penn and crispin glover in the role of the young man 
respectively .
the world is expanded upon
and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling ,
giving us a oader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america .
recommanded for anyone and everyone !
