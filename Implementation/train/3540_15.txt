rex reed once said of a movie
( `` julium and julium '' to be specific )
that it looked like
it was shot through pomegranate juice .
i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly .
this one appeared to be shot through gauze.the story was boring
and it was not helped that for large portion of scene actor ' faces were literally out of focus
or would only come into focus after extended period of time .
also 
everyone looked the same
so
it was hard to distinguish among the character .
i call this the `` dead poet society '' syndrome.there was nobody to care about ,
nobody to become interested in dramatically ,
and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.a total disappointment .
