i watch movie for a living ,
picking out
which one are good enough to distribute ... tossing aside those
that do not make the cut .
i am not saying
that i know more than anyone else
based on this ,
i am just leading you to how i came to watch `` the gospel of lou '' ... anyway ...
so many bad movie land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them .
i do not actually `` watch '' everything ,
usually i just look over at the tv occasionally
while i am working the scan for production value 
performance ,
and how well the story is being presented .
if something catch my eye i will take the time to watch it .
`` lou '' drew me in during the first few minute
where i closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the tv
so i could completely tune in .
needless to say
i was enthralled throughout the whole movie .
the story is told well ,
the character are either endearing or repulsive
( depending of course on the actor and director intention for the character )
and all very well played .
at time i caught occasional amateur mistake in the camera work and editing ,
but the emotional nature of the story make these fault easy to dismiss .
i have heard other person 's comment say
that at time the film ought tears to their eye 
other time extreme elation ... i was laughing one minute and crying the next
and was incredibly touched by this movie .
sadly i was unable to acquire it
because i was -
as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short .
that is the way
it goes sometime ...
but at least i had the pleasure
of seeing this one and i can not wait to see what kind of response it gets .
good luck and great fortune
to you bret carr
( if you read this ) ,
you are without a doubt a talent
to watch for .
