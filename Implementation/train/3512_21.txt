'how to lose friend and alienate person '
is an entertaining 
if loose 
adaptation of toby young 's memoir of the same name .
it is also a great title
for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb review !
the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incident dramatised ,
but a romantic plot is added
and the ending is certainly hollywoodised .
simon pegg ,
despite playing an essentially irritating person ,
is his usual likable and funny self
and pretty much carries the film .
strange to think
only a few year ago he was just a tv sitcom guy
and now he is rubbing shoulder with hollywood name .
there is a good
supporting cast
and it is an amusing 
easy watch - kind of a male 'ugly betty ' 
but funnier .
