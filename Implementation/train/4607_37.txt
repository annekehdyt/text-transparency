2002 's undeservedly popular `` i love the 80 's '' is an inane 
idiotic 
offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show
that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming
that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 ,
which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on tv !
i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter ,
i forget which one now 
of 2002
when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever .
out of sheer morbid curiosity
( i would guess
that is what you would call it )
i had decided
that i would go ahead
and give it a look-see anyhow the first night
it came on even though the advertisement looked like complete crap .
at least i can honestly say
that i was not a bit disappointed
by it
because my expectation were obviously bottom basement-level
to begin with .
the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minute was less on each year of the 1980 's and what was and was not culturally significan not or popular
( which is what i was expecting to see ) ,
but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedian to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skill *rolls eyes* ... more like lack-thereof
if you ask me !
it is pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiot
before they appeared on this show
because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempt at so-called `` humor ''
that i swear i could feel my intestine knot up with each and every rancid one-liner
they shot off one after another !
altogether 
i have no problem
in saying
that `` i love the 80 's '' was/is trash of the lowest denominator 
and one of the main reason
why i almost never watch vh1 anymore .
