full mark for pacino 's rendering of the speech over the dead kid 's coffin ;
shakespeare 's mark antony would be put to shame !
! was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper
who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogue ?
they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time
if you like movie with good script .
i found the story narrative
developing quite well right
up to the voice-over postscript.there is little else to talk about in this film ;
even john cusack has done better role than this one .
interestingly 
the film is very male oriented
-- the woman are mere appendage .
