this film is a great example of fine storytelling .
the acting is superb .
the story is inspiring
without being overly manipulative or fake .
there were a couple point
where they probably made person a tad more good or bad
than they really were ,
but considering it is a hollywood movie ,
they showed amazing restraint .
there was not a single explosion shown in the movie ,
even though they had one opportunity to .
the film ,
while having suspenseful part ,
was not made into an action movie .
the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary time .
well done !
