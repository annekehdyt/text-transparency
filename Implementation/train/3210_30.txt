i went to see this film with fairly low expectation ,
figuring
it would be a nice piece of fluff .
sadly 
it was not even that .
i could barely sit through the film
without wanting
to walk out .
i went with my two kid
( age 10 and 13 )
and even they kept asking ,
`` how much longer ? ''
after lasting until the end 
i just kept wondering
who would approve this script .
even the reliable fred willard could not save the trite dialogue 
the state joke 
and the banal plot .
i would suggest
that whoever wrote and directed this movie
( i use the term loosely )
should take an online screen writing class
or drop by their local community college for a film class .
at the least 
there are many book on directing 
screen writing ,
and producing movie
that would teach them something about structure 
plot 
dialogue and pacing .
