i actually like the original ,
and this film has its up and down .
here is just a few :
up :
most of the original voice cast returned.down :
i did not like the voice of timon 's ma .
i know
she did a voice in the simpson ,
but that show is just plain stupid .
up :
we get to see simba as a `` teenager .
`` down :
they wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between timon and simba .
up :
it was rafiki
who told timon about `` hakuna matata .
`` down :
how did pumbaa find out about it ? up :
song again .
( some of the original song were there ,
but they were just background music .
) down :
but stupid song .
( a.k.a .
timon 's solo .
) overall 
this is a pretty good movie .
i would recommend it for fan of the original .
but if you do not like the original ,
chance are you will not like this one.my score :
7/10
