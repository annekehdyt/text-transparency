i have read a lot of comment about the film
and how it is so hard for person
to believe
that it is a sequel to henry fool ,
and
even though it technically is ,
i think
that fay grim need to be looked at as an entirely different film .
just
because it is the sequel does
not mean
that it has to be a direct continuation of the first ,
and i enjoyed
that so much about it .
the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first ,
which makes sense
because the movie is not called henry fool 2 ,
it is fay grim .
all
that aside ,
the film 
i thought 
was so well made
and thought out
that it actually surprised me .
i was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film
and have to endure 2 hour of bad editing and an almost hard
to follow story-line
( aka parker 's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio )
but this was so surprisingly well focused
that it almost does not seem so ,
which i absolutely loved .
there are so many nuance in the film making
and writing
that i crave to see in film ,
but never do .
the cinematography was illiant due
to it is simplicity
and truly making the film seem 'grim ' throughout - in term of setting .
the writing was so well put together as well ,
whoever said
this movie is not as witty as henry fool need to watch again
and actually listen ;
i almost can not even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was 
and pertinent .
and well 
parker posey ,
who could complain ?
the scene
in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark
was so captivating and emotional .
and i thought
the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on ( in hindsight
because i do agree
that at time during you kind of felt lost ) .
the main thing
that struck me so powerfully about the film ,
and i believe the point of the film ,
was parker 's love and naivety about fool ,
which was so endearing and turned ,
yes very quickly 
from denial to outright passion .
the last five minute of the film were perfect .
obviously there were thing
that were not excellent ,
but nothing is perfect ;
some of the acting was poor 
and at time i did think
that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard
to follow and out of hand ,
but in the end you got it
and did not even mind
that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension .
( this may also have to do with goldblum 's tendency to talk extremely fast )
on the whole i would say
that it was probably one of the best film i
have seen this year ; stylistically pleasing 
clever and witty writing 
performance
that were so impressive i
now
have gained new respect for some of the actor 
and a truly touching film ,
and do not forget 
a complete departure from fool .
which was the point .
