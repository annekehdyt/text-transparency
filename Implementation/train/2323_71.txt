in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time ,
four city guy confront nature 's wrath 
in a story of survival .
the setting is backwood georgia 
with its forest 
mountain 
and wild rivers.the director 
john boorman 
chose to use local person 
not actor 
to portray secondary character .
these local imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history .
no central casting `` actor '' could ever come close to these person 's remarkable faces 
voice 
or action .
i do not recall a film wherein
the secondary character are so realistic and colorful .
as much as anything else ,
it is this gritty realism
that makes this film so amazing.another strength
is the film 's theme .
nature 
in the wild 
can be violent .
how appropriate
that the setting should be the american south .
very few place in the u.s. are 
or have been 
as violent as redneck country .
in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest 
the film conveys the idea
that human are part of nature ,
not separate from it .
`` deliverance '' is very much a product of its time
when 
unlike today 
american expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness .
the film 's magnificent scenery 
the sound of bird 
frog 
cricket 
and the roar of the river rapid ,
combined with the absence of civilization ,
all convey an environmental message .
and that is another strength of the film.at an entertainment level ,
the tension gradually escalates 
as the plot proceed .
not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme ,
and then never lets up 
not until the final credit roll .
very few film can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.finally 
the film 's technical quality is topnotch .
direction and editing are flawless .
cinematography is excellent .
dialogue is interesting .
and the acting is terrific .
burt reynold has never been better .
ned beatty is perfectly cast
and does a fine job .
and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar .
if there is a weak link in the film ,
it is the music ,
which strikes me as timid.overall ,
`` deliverance '' almost certainly will appeal to viewer
who like outdoor adventure .
even for those
who do not ,
the gritty characterization 
the acting ,
and the plot tension are reason enough to watch this film 
one of the finest in cinema history .
