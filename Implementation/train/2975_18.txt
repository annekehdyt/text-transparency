i watched this knowing almost nothing about it 
other than the ief description i read here .
after watching it i was originally going to say
that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish ,
then i looked at the other stuff
he is done
to see
if this was his first or second movie 
but no 
he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com .
he sort of missed the mark on both those movie
and it was the same with this one.the story was pretty awful too ,
could someone just fall in love with a girl
because she is pretty but has the mind of a child ?
i gave it a 3
because there were some visual
that i rather enjoyed near the end
but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible .
