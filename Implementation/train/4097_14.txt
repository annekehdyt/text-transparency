i was about thirteen
when this movie came out on television .
it is far superior in action than most movie since .
martin sheen is excellent ,
and though nick nolte has a small part ,
he too provides excellent support .
vic morrow as the villain is superb.when sheen `` tests the water '' in his '34 ford
( cool )
along the mountainous highway it is spectacular !
the ending is grand.i am disappointed in the low vote this received .
i figure
the younger generation have more interest in much of the junk
that is coming out these days.good taste
eludes the mass !
