i must have seen this a dozen time over the year .
i was about fifteen
when i first saw it in b
and w on the local pbs station.i bought a dvd set for the child to see ,
and am making them watch it .
they do not teach history in school ,
and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century .
it expands their critical thinking.impartially 
with the participant on all side
explaining in their own word
what they did and why ,
it detail what lead up to the war and the actual war.buy it for your child 
along with alistair cooke 's america .
watch it with them ,
and make them understand .
you will be so glad you did .
