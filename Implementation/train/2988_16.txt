if you lived through the 60s ,
this film can be at time painful and other time quite joyous .
it is all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloid prevalent at the time .
these are the root of a social revolution
that is still playing out :
`` do not speak too soon for the wheel 's still in spin ,
for the time they are a-changin ' '' .
while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd
and it is dissemination at the time ,
that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia 
influencing engineer 
scientist and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activity .
a salute to the filmmaker from one
who was there -
you have captured the era better
than i have seen before .
