the 1998 michael keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it is 
um 
shoddy special effect ,
but compared to what screaming mad george cooked up for this horror comedy
they are positively mind-boggling .
the killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arm look like oversized oven mitt .
which they probably were .
the cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozen of other
( much worse )
movie and paul keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role .
