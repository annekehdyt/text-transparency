this movie is just truly awful 
the eye-candy
that plays ben just can make up for everything else
that is wrong with this movie.the writer/director/producer/lead actor etc probably had a good idea
to create a movie dealing with the important issue of gay marriage 
family acceptance 
religion 
homophobia 
hate crime and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these time ,
but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly
conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.the script is poor 
the casting very ordinary ,
but the dialogue and acting is just woeful .
the homo-hating other is played by the most camp actor
and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actor
( i think
i have seen more passion in an corn flake ad ) .
the acting is stiff ,
and the dialogue forced
( a scene
where the other is feeding the detective his line
was the highlight )
.i am just pleased to see
that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution ,
and
if he is thinking of doing so ,
i have some advise -
just do not do it .
