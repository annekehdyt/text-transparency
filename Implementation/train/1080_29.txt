i realise
that the us army was demoralised by 1971 ,
but this film was unbelievable .
it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishmant battalion in a sven hassell novel .
the writer must be a real army hater .
the psycho sergeant
who kept beating the crap of person belonged in a prison cell ,
and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well .
these man were going overseas ,
the receiving unit would surely have wondered
where all the unusable damaged recruit were coming from ,
and an investigation would have ensued .
the scene
that blew
it completely
was the electrocution one .
farrell 
the alleged barrack room lawyer 
would have had the instructor over a barrel
for issuing an illegal order
( to torture pow in contravention to the geneva convention ) ,
actual assault on an enlisted man 
sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer .
intead he just walks away .
after this 
discipline ake down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable .
i do not know
how it ended ,
i went to bed .
