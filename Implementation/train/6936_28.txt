i was intrigued to see
how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009
and thus went to see the hurt locker .
sadly 
all i got for the two hour invested was the grim confirmation
that this film had won award purely for off-the-screen reasons.the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest
you will ever see .
when it is not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire ,
annoying `` shaky cam '' visual ,
it shows off all the hallmark of a second rate daytime soap opera in term of lensing.the `` plot ''
is threadbare ,
the characterization are about as well developed
as rejected beetle bailey comic strip idea and the dialogue - on the instance
where the film gives up on being `` minimalist ''
and for no apparent
reason turns one or two soldier into right chatterbox -
is some of the worst ever recorded .
in fairness 
the actor do the best they can in the circumstance ,
just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.the whole film has the feel
of it being intended as some kind of `` mockumentary ''
that they clocked was bereft of humour
and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.if
you spend two hour on this film
they are two hour
you will never get back ,
and two hour wasted
that you will regret for the rest of your life .
