earth
( 2009 )
***1/2 big screen adaptation of the bbc/discovery channel series `` planet earth '' offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moment
of `` how the hell did they get this footage ? ! ''
while taking in the awesome scenic of animal in their natural habitat and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel
( witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal ! )
and adorable
( the various baby and their 'rent ) .
the basso profundo tone of narrator jame earl jone solidify its 'god 's eye view ' and profundity .
culled from literally hundred of hour of footage ,
the only gripe comes from the fact
this should have been in the imax format
and could have even gone longer !
oh 
well 
there is always the next time
( since disney studio has produced this count on a series of more to come ) .
