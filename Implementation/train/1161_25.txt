if i watch a movie and do not once look at my watch or clock
to see how much longer it will be running
or when i hope
that the last scene was not the end of the movie ,
it is got to be pretty good .
i am not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist .
i watch movie
and if they keep me interested till the end ,
then they are pretty good
because some of the most critically acclaimed film bore me to death
( the english patient 
shakespeare in love 
atonement 
crash .
this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end .
acting is great ,
story is absolutely original 
flash-back technique very affective .
there was a bit of citizen kane
thrown in tho
when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him ,
but i forgive
that cause i see it as a homage to 
rather than a rip-off of 
orson .
