this film was bad .
bad acting 
bad directing 
bad writing .
but it was not bad in a funny way .
it was bad in a boring way .
i watched `` surface to air ''
because i thought
it might be a laugh .
it was not .
do not make the mistake i did .
there are plenty of more enjoyable way
to spend an hour and a half such
as watching paint dry
or reading the dictionary .
seriously .
