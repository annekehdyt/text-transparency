eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing
i have ever seen in my life .
when i saw it for the first time about 2 year ago i was in stitch for week after it .
to date i have seen
it a further 17 time and i still laugh my ass off each time .
for those
who do not know eddie murphy
was a illiant stand up comedian
before he was a hollywood superstar .
there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw
which was released in 1987
which goes flat during the middle .
if you are not the sort of person
who can not stand swearing then i
would not advise you to see it
as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 second .
i gave this a 10/10
because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best .
