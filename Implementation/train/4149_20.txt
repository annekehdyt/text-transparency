the fact
that this movie made it all the way
to the rentalrack in norway
is bizarre .
this movie is just awful .
this image quality is just one teeny bit better
than you get of a mobile phone
and the plot is soooo bad .
the main character is just plain annoying
and the rest just suck .
every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed .
the fact
that the person
that made this movie put their name on this
is extraordinary .
and the distributor ; did they even see it ! ?
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen .
to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind .
i urge you not to support this movie
by buying or renting it .
