i enjoyed this film very much .
many korean person will feel familiar with this film
because many of them have tutor
when they go to school .
cinematography was average .
the movie would have been better
if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular .
editing 
however 
was very neat
and unusual.the acting was also very good .
kim ha neul usually played an innocent 
weak girl in the korean soap-opaera .
but this time 
she plays a cute tomboy very well .
kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable.what i like the most about this film is ,
the emotion of the character are not too exaggerated .
there are many korean romance film
that the character cry river before the audience and i always thought
it was very stale .
there was no such crap in this movie.very funny and well-done .
