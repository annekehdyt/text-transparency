taken in the context of the time
it was made ,
i found this a worthwhile movie .
while the detail may be 'dramatized ' ,
the overall history was a nice primer .
in addition 
i found
spotting actor i knew a real pleasure .
who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad ?
i will leave the rest of the star spotting
to you .
as to the secondary casting 
this movie
( as one would expect from a movie
made in the late thirty )
has many an enjoyable character actor 
but top kudos ' to andrew jackson 's right hand man peavey .
the perfect touch of comedy .
well shot 
with beautiful ship 
and competent acting throughout out ,
i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp 
or an eye for a double-period piece ,
set at the dawn of america ,
and made in a period
when great name ,
and top notch character actor 
were a real pleasure
to enjoy .
