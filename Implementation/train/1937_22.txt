this film 
though 
critically acclaimed 
has of course not yet been released in the u.s. on dvd 
like another great - christine lahti 's `` housekeeping '' 
out the same year .
but if you can support region 4
( australian )
dvd 's 
this little masterpiece should be in your collection .
there are still some vhs copy available on the internet
as well.davis is complemented by a great story 
as well as memorable performance from her supporting cast 
especially claudia carvan and the late 
great jan adele .
amazingly 
or maybe not 
this film and its star went unacknowledged at academy award time ,
as did `` housekeeping '' ,
but treat yourself to both of them -
you will be glad
you did !
