caveman was by far the biggest load of crap i
have ever wasted my time watching .
this show
based on the geico commercial
is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico .
the makeup was half ass-ed
to say the least 
hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white tooth
even after going to the dentist .
this show could of had potential for a funny series
if they could of gotten the cast from the commercial ,
that in it self makes for a lousy show .
perhaps if the writer were the same from the geico ad this may of had a chance ,
instead the pilot lacked a good story line .
i give this show a 1/10 ,
i would of liked
to put a zero out of 10
but that was not an option .
i pray for a quick death to this show 
i would give it less then 5 episode
before it dies a deserving death .
