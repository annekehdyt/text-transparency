seriously .
i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and word
have failed me.i remember a time
when i would see charle band 's name on a film
and my heart would race .
he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter .
he was a bastion of hope for the little man .
the guy
whose movie arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex ,
but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk
we otherwise had to endure.and now ... this.a painfully-obvious californian walking trail double for `` the alps '' and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be `` an ancient cave '' .
i mean 
they did not even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way
that might suggest
it was anything other than an old train tunnel !
ugh !
instead of a creepy demon gladiator ,
as the cover imply ,
we are treated to a dude wearing the latest in wal-mart halloween apparel .
there is a pretty cool looking corpse ,
who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his finger ,
but he does not even learn to stand until the final five minute .
why could not he be the villain ?
instead 
we have got frat boy joe with a plastic sword .
ouch.charle band ... you should be ashamed
that your name is attached to such tripe .
i love movie
that are so bad ,
they are good .
hell 
i occasionally enjoy a flick
that so bad 
its just bad .
this one 
however 
is just unwatchable .
a perfect example
of making a buck ,
rather than making a quality film .
