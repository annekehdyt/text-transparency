ok ,
if you are looking for another bastketball diary ,
this is completely the wrong film.i revolf around two other .
max 
the younger 
has a major cocaine addiction .
adam 
the eldest 
is a doctor .
this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows
that drug make possible .
it however ,
does not .
it shows
that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present .
most of the movie focus is on max and his parting way .
eventually adam 
can no longer take the stress from his job
and begins to use as well
( perscription drug )
.this movie has almost no climax .
does not descend into what cocaine really does to you ,
has boring and low-budget scene ,
and the acting of the eldest other 
adam 
is horrific.i have no idea
how this movie has managed to pass and receive award ,
it is not a heart-wencher .
if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drug- rent ,
if not buy 'the basketball diary ' .
and notice the difference.try to avoid this movie but ,
if you think
you will enjoy .
try and see for yourself ...
