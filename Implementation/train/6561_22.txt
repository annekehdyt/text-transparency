warning :
contains a spoiler .
corny plot and in many case terrible acting .
fontaine is great ,
but some other 
particularly richard ney 
ivy 's husband 
are exceedingly wooden .
ney lies in bed ,
dying of arsenical poisoning 
with every hair in place .
yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful .
more faithful to the book than most movie of its era .
casting joan fontaine as a poisoner
( and an adulteress ,
which was just as shocking then -
i am not kidding 
kid )
was a masterful stroke .
she is just her usual joan fontainey self .
as murderer were supposed to ,
she dies by falling `` foot foremost through the floor into an empty space . ''
