my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film .
does it work ?
yes .
gee runs for mayor
and gets shot .
the homicide `` hall of fame '' turns up .
pembleton and nearly all of the cop
who ever played in this series .
a lot of flashback helps you
who hasn\u00b4t seen the tv-series
but it amuses the fan too .
the last five minute solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cop turn up .
and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox .
this is a good film .
