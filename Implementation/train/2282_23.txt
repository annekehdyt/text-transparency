thank god i watched this at a friend 's place
and did not pay for it .
the plot is horribly transparent
and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show .
if you have any knowledge of computer or electronic ,
watch out .
you will feel
feel
like the movie is an insult to your intelligence .
also 
actress turned much music vj amanda walsh
displays the worst acting i
have ever seen ,
excluding porn .
she is lucky that matt lanter is actually decent .
he is the one
that carries the movie .
i hate
that i wasted nearly two hour of my life watching this movie !
it is a shame
that they got to call it a sequel ,
because i was a fan of the original ,
which was actually pretty good .
