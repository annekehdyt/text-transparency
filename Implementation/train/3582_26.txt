this movie is awesome .
if you take it too seriously ,
of course you will hate it ;
however 
it is quantity of `` dude '' and `` right on '' ings laugh and faint memory of about 15 year ago .
i like its ability
to make me
simply chuckle at obvious joke and silliness 
and its ability
to make me want to watch its precursor 
`` bill and ted 's excellent adventure ''
( 1989 ) .
if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted joke ,
and totally mature humor ,
do not watch it ;
however ,
if you want a film
that is humorous and silly 
yet intelligent and engaging ,
you will enjoy it .
i actually wish more of this sort of picture
showed up in today 's theatre .
and hey 
it is keanu reeve acting the way
everyone parodies him
as acting ... right ... does not get much better than that : )
