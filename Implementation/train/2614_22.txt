with adam sandler.this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic film ever made .
it is about cruise ship waiter shecky
( sandler )
wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship .
first off 
there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly .
it is so unfunny
it is pathetic .
there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor ,
but the f-word is plentiful .
the budget is really low ,
and that also ruins the film .
it takes place on a cruise ship ,
but it seems
they only had money to rent out a small boat
and only had money for 10 ship extra ,
one of which is billy bob thornton .
the opening credit are animated reeeeeaally cheaply ,
and it is just pathetic .
i hate this movie and everyone else
that sees this will hate it too.86 min .
rated r for language .
