pialat film person in extreme emotional situation 
usually with several violent scene .
in la gueule ouverte 
he is dealing with the devastating effect on a woman 's husband and son as she dies of cancer .
in a nos amours 
the teenage girl 's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontation with her family .
here we have a rather spoiled young woman
who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con .
her motivation is a little cloudy ,
since loulou is incapable of reading
or discussing anything more challenging than tv show ;
on the other hand 
he is got a fabulous body
( i wonder
why depardieu never made a sport movie
to show off that physique
-- he would have been great as a rugby player )
.the casting is impressive .
isabelle huppert is not allowed to give a bland 
inexpressive performance
( she has given many ) ;
depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism
and charm you could want
-- see the scene in the bar ,
where he is stabbed in the gut ,
runs away and seeks treatment 
then soon restart with nelly .
guy marchand 
with those coal-black eye and distressed look ,
plays nelly 's husband beautifully ;
it is a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre .
