gundam wing is a fun show .
i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general .
however ,
after watching its predecessor 
such as mobile suit gundam 
zeta gundam 
and even g gundam 
i find wing to be gundam lite.character :
an aspect long held by gundam
is to have their character
thrust into difficulty
and grow into maturity .
this does not happen in wing .
heero is top dog at the beginning ,
and he is top dog at the end .
personality do not change ,
growth is never achieved .
the best character is zechs ,
who is for all intent and purposes a hero throughout most of the series .
but suddenly the series betrays him
and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.mecha :
wing has great suit design .
the gundam are super cool ,
with the epyon being my favorite .
i even consider a few of the oz suit design
to be on par with some of the classic zeon suit .
but sweet suit design does not quite save the series from boring character.conclusion :
in the end 
wing has cool fight scene ,
though riddled with recycled animation 
but shallow plot and character development .
enjoyable 
but not moving like previous gundam outing .
