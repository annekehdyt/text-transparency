an old vaudeville team of willy clark
( walter matthau )
and al lewis
( george burn )
were one of the best
known but they oke up hating each other .
over 20 year later they agree to get together for a tv special ...
but find out they still hate each other .
willy 's nephew/agent
( richard benjamin )
tries to get them to work together.a big
hit in its day
and it won george burn an oscar for best supporting actor .
i
( somewhat )
liked it .
it was written by neil simon so its non-stop one-liner .
some of it was funny
but making joke of willy and al 's senility was not .
also i never liked matthau .
i never thought
he was a good actor
and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way .
also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly .
all
that aside this was fun .
burn is just great tossing off one-liner with ease
and even matthau was good matching him .
their verbal battle are the best sequence in the movie .
also benjamin is very good
as willy 's nephew trying to get the two of them
to work with each other .
for me it is worth seeing for burn alone .
this jump started his career in a big way and two year later
he had another hit with `` oh god '' .
so 
this is good .
just good
-- not great .
matthau 's character really makes this hard to love .
i give it a 7 .
