the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving character to it.in every other way ,
this film is a very lame rip-off of jaws 
lake placid 
and alligator 
with a little bit of godzilla
( 1998 )
thrown in.as is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie ,
the two non-starring female each take their clothe off at least once .
the female lead does not ,
since she obviously has a better agent .
the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing ,
in which surfer cut themselves and surf in shark-infested water .
in this film 
a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area .
person get eaten .
the movie ends.i do not mind a bad horror movie ,
but i really hate a dull bad horror movie ,
which this definitely is .
