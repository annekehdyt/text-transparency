the original animated dark knight return in this ace adventure movie
that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness .
there is a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman ,
so much more than batman forever or batman
and robin.there is a new crime-fighter on the street of gotham .
she dresses like a bat
but she is not a grown-up batgirl .
and batman is denying any affiliation with her .
meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romance and detective work .
but the penguin 
bain and the local mob makes thing little more complicated.i did not have high hope for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman :
sub zero
( robin is not featured so much here !
)
but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set piece 
the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor .
this is definitely a movie no fan of batman
should be
without .
keep your ears open for a really catchy song
called 'betcha neva '
which is featured prominently through-out.it is a shame
the dvd is not so great .
do not get me wrong
there are some great feature
( the short 'chase me ' is awesome )
and a very cool dolby 5.1 soundtrack
but ... the movie is presented in pan and scan .
batman :
mystery of the batwoman was drawn
and shot in 1.85:1
but this dvd is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clip
shown on the feature there is picture cut off on both side .
i find this extremely annoying
considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen .
warner have had to re-release literally dozen of movie on dvd
because person have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some title .
why they chose to make
that same mistake here again is beyond me.i would give this dvd 5/5 but the lack of oar ings the overall score down to 4/5 .
it is a shame
because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package .
