though not a fan of sam rockwell ,
i was surprised
when i saw his name in the credit in the opening of 'joshua . '
heck 
i was not even aware
he was in 'joshua '
until i started the movie .
so it goes
without saying ,
i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie 
not the lead .
a sort of 'rosemary 's baby 
' 'the oman ' or any other demonic kid movie 'joshua ' was billed .
unfortunately 
it fell flat .
slow 
incredibly slow 
and flat .
yet 
i continued on to see how this would all resolve ,
hoping beyond belief ,
the ending climax would shed some light on the subject .
okay 
i admit ,
it did ( a wee bit )
but what a stale closing .
and what a low-low budget movie 
or at least that is how they designed it .
a person falls \u0096 you do not see the drop ,
you see someone
lying down in what appears to be blood .
a person gets
hit by a cab \u0096 you do not see it ,
you see someone complaining ,
holding a bike up .
i am not sure
if this is called `` style '' or laziness or simply 
lack of fund for special effect .
we have a `` rich '' family with a crazy mom 
a workaholic father
attempting to balance everything 
a kid \u0096 joshua ,
who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl
who cries a lot .
she cries as much
as we see how many day she is alive \u0096
and what was that about ?
are there rat above
or is it joshua ?
is his mother nut ?
is joshua crazy ?
is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family ?
is he going to grow up to be michael myer ?
or does he drive his family to the ink ?
i do not think so .
they were nut prior ,
and no `` so-called '' acting could make me believe otherwise .
unfortunately ,
barely any question were answered ,
barely any open door shut .
i am sure
that might have been the idea ,
but for pete 's sake 
give me something .
anything .
there are plenty better kid-gone-wild movie to explore .
joshua 's more like the mini-me of the antichrist .
