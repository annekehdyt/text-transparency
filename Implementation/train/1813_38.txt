like many here i grew up with scooby-doo .
unlike many here
who did ,
i love this show !
i think
that it has been very well done
and thought through .
everything about it marks it as a spin-off which is not meant to be taken seriously .
the formula is simple -
it is a parody of other cartoon with a single bad guy
trying to get the better of the good guy .
by using the well known shaggy and scooby-doo character
it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode.there
have always been scooby-doo spin-off
which have annoyed fan .
the classic being the scooby-shaggy-scrappy short from the 80 's .
these spin-off had their place :
they allowed new content to be sold ,
created new fan ,
and kept scooby-doo merchandise on the shelve .
i would agree
that `` shaggy and scooby-doo :
get a clue ! ''
does not fit in with this traditional role
but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby-shaggy-scrappy short to be :
an action packed show
which focuses on the best/funniest scooby-doo character !
good feature of the show :
the animation 
the voice 
the attention to detail 
the bad-guys 
the `` best friend '' relationship between shaggy and scooby-doo 
the constant humour !
bad feature :
none ,
although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times.well done warner bros. animation !
one of the cleverest cartoon in a long time !
