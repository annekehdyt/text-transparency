in a little town in montana two other grow up .
one of them is norman
( craig sheffer ) ,
the other is paul
( brad pitt ) .
their father is reverend maclean
and they grow up with his lesson
that has to do with religion 
and the lesson of fly-fishing .
in this movie fly-fishing represents life 
a little.the story is good
and keeps your attention
although there are some moment
you need a little action .
probably the movie has this moment
because it is not really about the event
that happen ,
but about the message .
some thing do happen though .
norman goes to dartmouth to study .
after six year he returns
and gets involved with a nice girl
named jessie
( emily lloyd )
and he is invited to teach in chicago .
paul has become a reporter
and is known as the `` fishing reporter '' .
he is famous
and it seems
he has a nice life ,
but he drinks a little too much
and gamble too much.the movie is very well directed ,
it has a nice score
and all of the actor are good .
the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography .
the mountain 
the wood and the river all look very beautiful .
if the movie was only made for these thing
it was good enough to watch .
fortunately there is more .
