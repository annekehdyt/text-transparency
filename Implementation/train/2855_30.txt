this was a great movie with a good story .
my child
( 10 
7 
5 
and 4 )
all loved this movie ,
including myself .
the music was also fantastic .
no 
the horse do not talk 
but instead ,
the story is told by spirit .
and to hear a story
told by a horse 's point
if view was fun.i think
the title says
it all 
`` spirit '' .
this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friend .
i would have to say
my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie ,
and even got so into it ,
they laughed so hard ,
and they cheered for spirit in the end .
enjoy `` spirit '' with your family
and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story .
your kid will love it .
i think
you will too .
