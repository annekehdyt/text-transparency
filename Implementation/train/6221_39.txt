until today i had never seen this film .
its was filmed on the set of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village
where supposedly giant bat are sucking the blood of the villagers.frankly its a damn good movie
that has atmosphere to spare and a cast
that will not quit 
lionel atwill 
dwight frye 
faye wray and melvin dougla
playing a character
named brettschnieder
which is of interest to me
since that was my great grandmother 's maiden name.this is a carefully modulated film
that has suspense and witty one liner
that slowly build for its ief running time ,
only going astray
when about ten minute before the end
they realized
they had limited time
to wrap everything up .
from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun
that preceded it.leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minute and warn of shorter print .
the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong ,
and in this case i think
they are since a source i trust more says
the full running time is 67 minute
( the overlook film encyclopedia )
quibbling about this i know is insane
but since most print
that are available tend
to run around 60-63 minute the amount of missing material
is considerably less if its only 67 minute long .
personally i think
it will not matter
that much since its at most five minute and i doubt very much it will make or eak the film.what ever the running time ,
if you like creaky old film ,
do ,
by all mean do 
watch this movie 
its a great dark and stormy night film .
