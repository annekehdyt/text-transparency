ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie.this
is only a superposition of scene
without a clear link.acting is also very bad ,
despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli .
but something is really astonishing in this movie ,
talking about sexuality 
emancipation of woman ,
nude scene are very rare in arab cinema 
even in this day .
i really congratulate the director and the actor for their courage .
we want to see more of this style in egyptian movie ,
but with better quality .
the reason
that led me to vote this film as an awful one
are not only scenario and acting ,
but also the lack of prfessionalism .
this movie look like an amateur one.we can see a lot of error in the screen .
if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended.but
if you wish to encourage the uncensored movie in all the arab world watch it
and make your friend
and your family do the same .
