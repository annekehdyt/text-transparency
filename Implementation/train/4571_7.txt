my wife and i have watched this movie twice .
both of us used to be in the military .
besides being funny as hell ,
it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy enlisted man ,
and tells
it `` like it really is '' .
we are adding this movie to our permanent collection !
