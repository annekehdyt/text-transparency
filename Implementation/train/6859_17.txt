this film reminds me of how college student used to protest against the vietnam war .
as if 
upon hearing some kid were doing without cheeseburger in cow dung collehe ,
the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy.the worst thing is that ,
while dangerous 
the concept of a policy
based on if the ussr and us went to war
it could mean the end of the world 
worked .
the us and ussr never went to war.had we only conventional weapon ,
the notion of yet another war 
a `` win-able '' war 
in europe and asia was not unthinkable.not
that i think
they should get rid of this movie .
it should be seen by film student as a splendid example of `` how not to make a film .
`` it should be 0 star or maybe black hole ...
