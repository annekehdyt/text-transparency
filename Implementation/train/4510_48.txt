1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4/10
( dir-mick garris ) :
campy vampire-like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy element
that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie
and you wonder
if this movie might have a cult following for king fan .
it is the story of a mother and son
who are sleepwalker
( a shape-shifting feline-like 
flesh eating 
life needing 
near extinct eed of humanoid )
who move from town to town
searching for virgin
to feed on to keep themselves alive .
they come across as pretty normal upper-class folk
except they are secret lover
and cat hang around the outside of their home 
day and night .
cat are deadly to them ,
so they set trap in their yard
to try
and keep the population down .
we get to see them eak a couple of their neck
when they attack
( which is also a first in my movie-going experience )
-- -
hopefully no real cat were harmed in the making of the film .
the boy is after a sweet girl
that he has a crush on until
he turns into a `` sleepwalker ''
and then he just wants her body .
there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie
that it might have been better
if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life ,
but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minute
until you wish
he had just get over it and ing out the gore .
eventually
that happens and the movie winds down to it is typical stephen king downbeat ending .
the movie is interesting
because king 's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present
and what you have is a movie
that his fan will probably like
and should have in their collection ,
but as a worthwhile movie experience
it really
does not cut it .
