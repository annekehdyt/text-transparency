every now and then a film maker ings to life a unique group of person
and let you inside
to see the thing
that make us human .
lawrence kasden done this again .
i always felt
thebg cill was the anthem of it is age
and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon .
every so often we find ourselves at a point
where we have the opportunity
to choose life
and so often we blow it .
this is a film about person
who find the courage
to choose and experience life
because of that choice .
the juxtaposing of little and big event
that let us see
how basically trivial most thing
we worry about are
is truly genius .
i have watched this film a number of time
and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotion run through this film .
danny glover and kevin kline do their role with great tenderness
and stever martin portrayal of a movie exec is priceless .
thank you again mr. kasden
