this movie is plain fun.i has nothing to do with the original america pie ,
but it is fun to watch.another try 
but better than band camp and the naked mile 
at least funnier.just after first five minute i was laughing my ass out ,
so i decided to call my friend
and we would watch
it together.we had a few beer
and we had fun.you will not find any deep message in this movie ,
but it is worth watching.so 
lay back
and just enjoy .
