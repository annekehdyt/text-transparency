the first five minute of this movie showed potential .
after that 
it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy .
the best part is that i could not stop thinking of supertrooper thank to joey kern .
i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning
how not to make a movie .
there are so many scene in this movie
that makes one just stop and wonder
if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point .
the thing
that amazes me most about this movie
is that it grossed $ 22 million in the box office
and only cost about $ 1.5 million
to make .
congrat to lion 's gate for being able to pull that one off .
