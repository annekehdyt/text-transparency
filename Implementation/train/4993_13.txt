this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemania ever
and is only saved by 2 match .
the hardcore match between edge and mick foley 
also vince mcmahon against shaun michael .
the main event between cena and triple h was a complete washout
and to be honest i nearly fell asleep
it was so actionless ,
the casket match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke .
if you are really a big fan of the wwe
and have missed the early day of the wwf
and the wrestlemania 17 and 19 you will probably love this .
but i found
that this wrestlemania left a lot to be desired .
