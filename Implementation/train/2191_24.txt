( question )
what do you call 100 film critic buried up to their neck in sand ?
( answer )
a good start .
well 
i do not know peter mattei from adam
but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests ,
`` love in the time of money '' is a `` good start '' .
a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music 
this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationship
as it moves from person a to person b to person c ... etc ...
and back again ending with person a and b in carousel fashion .
the film gently probes the unhappy circumstance of nine person with finely rendered shading beginning
and ending with a street whore and her client .
the downside of this film is the lack of a story
which may have something to do with the many critical slam
it received .
i watched the behemoth `` angel in america '' last night
and was bored at the end
while this little concatenation of character study kept me spell bound .
use caution .
i may be the only person
who really liked this flick .
