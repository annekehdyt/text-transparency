let 's see .
in the `` st. elsewhere '' finale we found out
that there was no hospital
and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child .
`` newhart '' ended by telling us
that it had all been a dream .
and `` roseanne '' ended by telling us
that it all had taken place in her mind .
very `` creative '' .
annoying was more like it .
yes 
it was just a tv show
and was not at all reality .
it is just that
when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show
you end up at least wanting
to believe
that it is all `` real '' .
at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen .
this type of series finale had been done twice
before and was old hat 
frustrating and simply not fun to watch .
now `` newhart '' being all a dream ?
at least done in a creative way
that far exceeded the expectation of anyone
who loved the show .
the idea itself was not too engaging
but it was so illiantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever .
roseanne left me feeling cheated
after being such a loyal fan .
