the first cruel intention 
the original 
is my favorite movie of all time .
it was an absolute masterpiece .
so how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad .
sarah michelle gellar was perfect in the first movie .
in this one 
amy adam suck .
she is terrible .
and could not they have found a chick
who actually looked like sarah michelle gellar ?
at least the same hair color ! ! !
i mean come on .
robin dunn is not as bad as adam ,
but he is absolutely terrible
when compared to ryan phillipe .
the sebastian in the first film is devious 
deceitful ,
and much more evil than the sebastian in the prequel .
and what is up with the story line .
it basically goes like this ... 1- sebastian has a bad rep at his first school ,
so the movie says ,
although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life ,
and how he has been with girls 2- sebastian move to new york ,
and just suddenly decides
he is going to turn himself around .
he `` falls in love '' with danielle
( might i remind you that in the original ,
sarah michelle giller says
quote `` you oke up with the first person
you ever loved
because i said
to- so how can he have been in love in the prequel ? ? ? ) .
and he is all nice and charming ,
and all `` good person '' ,
as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing.3-
he does a complete 180 ,
and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie ,
and then seducing cherry.i mean 
its terrible .
and i loved the first one so much .
i have not even seen the third one yet .
i hope to god its better than this prequel .
