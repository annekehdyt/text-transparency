i love paul mccartney .
he is 
in my oppinion 
the greatest of all time .
i could not 
however 
afford a ticket to his concert at the tacoma dome during the back in the u.s. tour .
i was upset to say the least .
then i found this dvd .
it was almost as good as being there .
paul is still the man
and i will enjoy this for year to come .
i do have one complaint .
i would of like to hear all of hey jude.also paul is not dead.the single greatest concert dvd ever .
***** out of ***** .
