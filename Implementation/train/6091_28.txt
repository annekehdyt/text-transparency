2 word :
academy award .
nuff said .
this film had everything in it .
comedy to make me laugh ,
drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scene to rival breakin 2 :
electric boogaloo .
the acting was tip top of any independant film .
jeremy earl was in top form long
since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show .
his line were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker .
i thought
i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington
when the line `` my bus ! !
it is ... . gone ''
that was the true turning point of the movie .
my grandmother loved it sooo much
that i bought her the dvd
and recommended it to her friend .
it will ing tear to your eye and warmth
to your heart
as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond .
through thick
( being held up at knife point )
and thin
( nathan giving tony tip on woman )
the new dynamic duo has arrived
and are out to conquer hollywood .
