`` elvira 
mistress of the dark '' is a sort of `` harper valley p.t.a . ''
with touch of the supernatural .
elvira
( cassandra peterson )
walks off her job as television horror movie hostess
after the new station 's owner gets fresh with her .
she is now relying on a las vegas show
to carry her through ,
but learn she needs to come up with more money
to get the show started .
thing look hopeless to raise
that money until she receives notice of her aunt 's death ,
which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will .
a house in need of repair 
a dog 
and a cookbook are all
that is left to her by her aunt ,
and again
it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show .
the adult of the small and narrow minded town make thing worse
by making thing more difficult for elvira .
only the local hunk
( daniel greene ) ,
and a group of teenager will befriend her .
elvira 's uncle `` vinnie ''
( w. morgan sheppard ) ,
presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook ,
but elvira soon learn of her powerful heritage
that includes spellcasting 
and a couple very effective casserole .
elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle ,
but he is determined to get his hand on it
knowing of its power .
elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town 's old charge of witchcraft 
and the showdown between her and her uncle .
the plot is pretty simple ,
but the humor and well developed character keep it moving at a nice pace .
`` elvira 
mistress of the dark '' is full of cute 
gross 
bawdy 
and clever humor
carried through by the many sight gag 
pun 
prop 
song 
and parody .
the film 's touch of the occult make this one of the best horror parody ever made .
it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performer ;
including edie mcclurg 
and jeff conaway
( of `` grease . '' )
there are also nice special effect .
many person
( including myself )
wondered
if the elvira character could carry a feature film ,
and the answer is delightfully 
yes !
