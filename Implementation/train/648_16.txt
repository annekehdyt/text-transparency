well here i go with another b industry movie .
it is sad enough to see some badly made film
but i do not care
if a b industry or c industry produces the film .
show some effort in your work .
the character are really bad .
the acting is not in question in this one
( surprise ) ,
but plot is .
how can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldier butchered ,
and then go on
as if nothing happened .
what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining member a scene
where they joke
about how nice the doctor 's ass was .
give me a eak .
