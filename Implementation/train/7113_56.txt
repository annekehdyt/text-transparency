the electric mayhem 
gonzo and camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical
that they are trying to get on broadway .
after miserably failing at getting it produced ,
they all split up and go their separate way .
i love the character and cameos .
the song in the film are `` together again '' 
`` look at me 
here i am '' ,
`` saying goodbye '' ,
`` and i am going to alway love you '' 
`` rat jazz '' and `` he will make me happy '' .
frank oz directs this movie excellently
and all the actor do a great job
acting like the muppet are real .
see it !
91 minute .
