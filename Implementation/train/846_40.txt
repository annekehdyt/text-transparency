it looks like the illiant team of shonda rhime outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore 
maybe to the mediocreland ?
`` pp '' reminds me any one of the many tedious ,
promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flick
( picket fence 
ally mcbeal 
and now boston legal ) .
the crazy case
they get
are so outlandish ,
they barely evoke sympathy or sadness .
and that is what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situation
you are afraid of ,
`` this could be me '' sentimant .
they are not funny either.the actor are quite good ,
but the plot line are dead
and can not be ought back to live .
i am a therapist ,
and let me tell
you
- amy brennan
plays the most unbelievably incompetent 
unethical 
untrained therapist .
whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethic and the transference/counter-transference course in stanford .
somebody should give them a code of ethic to read
( the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist 's involvemant in it ) .
no therapist are that bad.woman yearning for man
who have moved on -
had been done to death ,
we have all graduated `` sex and the city '' .
addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy
she likes - very age-inappropriate ,
looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 ,
and this otherwise talented actress does not believe
it herself
and does not deliver it very well .
the only successful/palatable developmants are addison struggling with her decision
to move to la ,
and the `` voodoo dr '' and his coping with widowhood.this concept might work with a whole new writing team .
