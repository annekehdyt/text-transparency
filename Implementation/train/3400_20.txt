the movie freddy 's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street ,
yes
it has comedy essence about it ,
so has all the other film ,
but how can anyone possibly say
that you would not find freddy krueger scary 
if you were to come across this man in your dream you would not find him even more scary with a comic essence about him
because his comedy show that he does not care at all about killing you
that he finds it extremely funny 
and freddy also plays comic mind game with them ,
which in its own way is very disturbing ,
by using his comic way i think that makes the horror movie nightmare on elm street what they are today ,
the writer are extremely clever
making krueger comic and scary
as oppose to jason vorhee ,
who does not say anything
and has not got the wit
to truly frighten his victim ,
this movie is about as good as freddy 's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way `` do not fall asleep !
`` .
