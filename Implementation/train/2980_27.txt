long before tim lahaye and jerry b. jenkin would shake the world of the christian subculture
( and make million in the process )
with the left behind book 
mark iv picture 
the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association 
gave us this masterwork .
what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail ,
sitting in a living room .
instead of taking us to the dramatic scene of this `` post-rapture '' tribulation ,
we sit in the living room ,
hearing about it on the news
because the filmmaker can not afford to show it .
the film 's premise is grounded in pre-millenial 
pre-tribulation eschatalogy ,
believing
that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church ,
and then comes again at the end of the seven year of hell on earth .
what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh .
the intriguing adventure of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation
( and two of the film 's three sequel )
tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation .
i hate to admit it ,
but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this .
it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail .
i think
i am the only person in history
to make that observation .
