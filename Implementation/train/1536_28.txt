- a mexican priest becomes a wrestler
to save an orphanage or something
-i went to see this movie
because it was about non-wwf wrestling
and so i thought
it might be funny .
it was not .
it is excruciating to watch .
embarrassing .
any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered .
i admit i do not like jack black anyway .
after this i have been racking my ain to think of one good role
that he has performed .
the only thing i can come up with where he was o.k .
was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in 'high fidelity ' .
jack black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guy
( like the little fat one in abbot and costello or jerry lewi )
who should be told
that
being overbearingly idiotic
is not the same thing
as being funny .
it is not even slapstick .
it is just irritating .
it is not even stoopid ,
it is just stupid.i heard good thing about napoleon dynamite too ,
but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out
to find it on dvd .
