this reworking of anthony shaffer 's classic play did not last long in cinemas .
having recently suffered through it on cable ,
i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket .
director kenneth branagh 
writer harold pinter 
and star/producer jude law deluded themselves
that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minute ,
without the fun or class of the longer original.michael caine enhanced his reputation
playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film .
he now seems intent on destroying it
by attempting the lead ,
played in that version by laurence olivier .
( both were nominated for best actor oscar ,
but lost to marlon brando in the godfather . )
looking puffy and washed-out 
caine glide through the part with less depth
than he displays as batman 's butler .
he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter .
what is next
-- alfie ii 
or son of the man
who would be king ?
but then 
no one benefit from this inane adaptation by pinter ,
who thinks
that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffer 's witty character interplay .
branagh 's direction rely on bluish lighting and a soulless set design
that would not hold up in a second-rate nightclub .
neither the shadow nor the tight ,
overacted close-up can help law overcome his dull screen persona .
the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller ,
almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.fan of the original stage production
( with anthony quayle and keith baxter )
and the olivier/caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream .
the late mr shaffer ,
who wrote the 1972 screenplay 
as well as hitchcock 's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptation ,
must be turning in his grave ,
wishing he could plan a real murder or two !
