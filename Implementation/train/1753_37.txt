in 1943 
a group of raf officer ,
including eric wiiliam ,
decide to escape from a pow camp
using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard .
in 1950 
it was decided to film his account ,
and it kick-started a peculiar british film genre- the military prison camp story
that reached its apogee in danger within
( 1959 )
.the wooden horse is one of the quietest film i
have ever watched .
there are no great dramatic moment ,
but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax
that has more tension
because the story does not give way for unlikely drama ,
jump cut or jacked up
( something about to happen ! )
music .
it is utterly of its time
and works beautifully.leo glenn 
anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extra
and ( i suspect )
non-actor .
without exception 
all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet .
they keep emotion out of their role .
as so many were ,
until recently 
ex-service 
i suspect
they recreated their war time
role as 'officer and gentlemen'.this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension .
on the contrary ,
unlike most wartime escape film ,
the story does not end at the barbed wire :
and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end .
