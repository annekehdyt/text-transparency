i watched this with a growing sense of unease .
why would god 
in the shape of ian hunter 
help these particular person in their attempted escape from devil island ?
and what was he doing there in the first place ?
i mean ,
i know god works in mysterious way ,
but helping thieve and murderer and prostitute find redemption 
forgiveness and changes-of-heart in such a godforsaken location ... .
in any event it is hardly a likeable movie .
whatever gable
had by way of charm
is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man ,
crawford is as endearing as ever
she was i.e .
to me 
not at all ,
and the whole look of the film makes it seem
as if it was made 10 year before.compared to contemperaneous film like `` stagecoach ''
and `` mr. deeds goes to town '' ,
this looks prehistoric .
