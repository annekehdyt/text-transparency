batman mystery of the batwoman 
is 
in a word 
stale .
the plot goes
that a mysterious female vigilante
( `` batwoman '' )
is intruding on batman 's turf ,
and
while batman is trying to combat a penguin/bane/rupert thorne threesome ,
he is trying to figure out
who the mysterious batwoman is .
there is nothing strikingly wrong about this ,
but there is nothing really special about it either ,
noting really made it stick out .
mask of the phantasm had bruce 's long lost love re surface
and mess with his head.subzero was a major event in the life of mr freeze .
even the batman beyond movie spin off 
return of the joker 
dug deep with the character involved .
but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplot ,
a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat .
frankly 
this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight ,
lacking the punch and bite
that the animated series had in it is prime .
