alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller
you could think of :
he set the standard so high
that any director
who makes a suspense movie
will be fatally
compared to him.the main subject of this bullock vehicle 
all the idea ,
almost everything was already in hitchcock 's classic `` rope '' :
the two student
who commit a gratuitous crime ,
nietsche is philosophy ,
and the clue
that the boy disseminate 
the master was the first to transfer them to the screen.and with an eighty-minute movie
which was a technical riveting tour de force .
`` murder by number `` does not take place in a single room 
like `` the rope '' 
mind you.and 
what a supreme originality 
it pits two cop against the evil youngster ;
and 
you would never guess it ,
these two cop are very different :
actually 
bullock play the part of woman
living like a man ,
and her partner
( chaplin )
is as shy
as a clueless girlie.the two boy ' performance are not really mind-boggling 
not as good ,
as 
say ,
that of edward norton in `` primal fear '' .well ,
you know 
'' rope '' was so good ... .
