i had to give this film a 1
because it is that bad ,
but do not make this think
that i did not enjoy watching ,
because i laughed and laughed ,
and i even had a few question .
so half of the time i was laughing ,
half of the time i was saying
`` what in the hell is going on ? ''
or `` why would someone do this ? ''
et cetera .
i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effect 
the 80 's style nude scene/battle/dialogue/nude scene 
and the way
that the warrior 's sword flap in the wind
when they ride their horse .
and there is some crappy model effect
( those are not supposed to be real tree ,
are they ? )
and i still do not understand this guy
that they find in the cave ,
what in the hell is he ?
a friend of mine told me about these movie and i thought
i would give em a try ,
and i basically liked the film as person like ed wood film ,
i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be 
i look at it in my own hilarious way .
so do not let this distract you
if you really thought
this was an action movie ,
it is ,
i just liked it for other reason .
it is much ,
much worse than evil dead ,
so it can actually make you think
as though you are wasting your life by watching it
( which came into my mind a few time ) .
i guess
the best thing for most person would be to have a few drink ,
have some friend around 
and laugh at this film .
maybe this is a bit harsh ,
but i do not think so ,
rent it
and you will see .
yo .
