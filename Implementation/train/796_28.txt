*spoilers*i am sure back
when this was released in 1958
it was much appropriate for its time .
back then film were slower paced to allow audience to follow and analyze the story .
here a man moves into a house
owned by his last wife
that died mysteriously with his new wife .
the gardener mickey
( played by alex nicol ,
who also directed he film )
really is an underappreciated character .
he gets a skull to indirectly warn jenni
that she is in trouble ,
since he knew
that there was foul play in the first wife 's death .
he can not tell jenni directly what happened ,
so he tries to scare her off with the skull .
jenni 
we also find out ,
saw her parent die ,
thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish
that lead to institutionalization .
like many audience today 
i found the pacing
to be a little too slow for my taste .
but if you like slow-paced horror
without a lot of gore ,
this film is for you .
