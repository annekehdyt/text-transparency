i have no idea how imdb sort review but i do know
that ,
as happen often on amazon.com ,
there are a striking number of very negative review for this movie
which repeat the same 
somewhat obscure talking point 
almost verbatim .
a campaign ?
only imdb knows.as for this movie :
it is fine .
it is a funny ,
cute and very straightforward movie.it is been over a decade
since i worked in brooklyn ,
lived in queen and visited relative in the south bronx .
but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kid .
is the grandmother a bizarre character ?
yup .
do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this ?
yes 
thankfully 
they do .
are other movie
set in the les and featuring dominican / puerto rican kid possible ?
you betcha .
does that make this movie a crime \u0097 as some of the
( to my eye 
astroturf )
comment would suggest ?
hardly .
let a thousand plastic flower bloom.this is better than any episode of degrassi jr. high or degrassi high .
scoff at the comparison but _we have never had that_
and i am touched 
to the core ,
by this movie 's humility of purpose and tender spirit.that said ,
i would love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting !
