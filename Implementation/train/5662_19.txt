this is the only full length feature film about the world of idge .
i found the first 10 minute a bit slow ,
but after that 
the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional idge player
and how they go about earning a living .
some of the scene are very funny .
i do not think
that a non-idge player would get the charm of this movie .
some of the dress are really beautiful ,
pity the movie is in black and white - i can only imagine
what they would look like in colour .
the way
the medium are portrayed
is absolutely hilarious .
there is no way
on earth idge will ever be like that .
watch it as soon
as you can ,
and tell your friend about it .
