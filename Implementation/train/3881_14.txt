upon seeing this film once again
it appeared infinitely superior to me this time
than the previous time i have viewed it .
the acting is stunningly wonderful .
the character are very clearly drawn .
brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son
who rebels .
the other actor and actress are equally fine in every respect .
robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the day of speakeasy of the 1920s .
the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountain and stream of western montana .
all in all 
this is one of the finest film
made in the 1990s.you
must see this movie !
