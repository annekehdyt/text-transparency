okay 
so robbie 's a little hokey-looking by today 's standard ,
and some of the acting is pretty stilted ,
and most of the special effect could now be duplicated by a ight 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program .
and do not get me started about the poster.this is still a great movie 
40 year
after it was released .
i grew up watching `` science fiction '' on the local tv station 's `` science fiction/adventure theater '' on sunday afternoon ,
so i have seen quite a few sf movie from the '50s .
at a time when most movie were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody
and have him demolish a miniature model of a city ,
forbidden planet forever raised the bar
and showed
that it was possible to make a science fiction movie
which actually had a plot.i doubt
that many sf movie made in the '90 will
still be considered worth watching in 2030 .
