the hill have eye ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more .
of course it is not going to be an oscar nominated film ,
it is just pure entertainment
which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.the plot
is basically about a group of national guard trainee
who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbilly on their last day of training in the desert .
it is just them fighting back throughout the whole film ,
which includes a lot of violence
( which is basically the whole film )
as blood and gut are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing ,
and also yet another graphic rape scene
which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.i would give
the hill have eye ii 4/10 for pure entertainment ,
and that only .
although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on ,
as it began to drag due to the fact
it continued to try
and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stay awake .
the hill have eye ii is just decent entertainment 
something to pass time
if you are bored ,
and nothing else.4/10
