i am a huge steven seagal fan .
hell 
i probably weigh as much
as he does
although i do not have the street cred
to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail .
having stated my own bias and affection for america 's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero ,
it is with a heavy heart
that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever .
i am not sure
he could make a movie any worse than this.in his defense the major problem with this film seem to occur in post-production .
it is painfully obvious
that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline .
that result in woeful voiceover
in which steve 's voice does not nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice .
the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad 
gets even worse ,
and by the end you will wish
you had rewatched the da vinci code instead .
yes 
it is that bad.after this i do not know what to expect from steve .
my friend still laugh at me for listening to his cd .
is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty log ?
if you are tempted to watch this movie ,
rip your eyeball out and flush them down the toilet .
a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minute of this .
