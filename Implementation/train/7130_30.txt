2 star 
and i am being generous .
( minor spoiler )
look 
this is a low budget zombie movie
set in gangland oakland .
as the plot goes ,
a scientist wants to ing his dead other back to life
after being killed in a drive-by.the main problem with this movie :
what zombie ? !
all the `` zombie '' do is growl
( which does not sound even remotely scary )
and drip fake red blood from their mouth !
no scary eye 
no decaying flesh 
just a bunch of person growling pathetically
and running around like idiots.the cover is also misleading .
there are only about 6 zombie in the whole film ,
so it is not like the whole `` hood '' is plagued with zombie or anything ,
it is just a few ,
and is contained in no time.the acting actually is so bad
it is hilarious .
no one can act at all in this movie
( except maybe one of the gang member )
and it really seems like a bunch of friend got together ,
decided to cast their family ,
and made a movie one weekend.final note :
since when do doctor wear tracksuit ? !
skip this one 
please !
