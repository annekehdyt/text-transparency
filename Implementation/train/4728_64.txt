although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching ,
you better skip this one .
i watched this one on television ,
so i did not have to plunk down cash for it .
lucky me.the plot develops slowly 
very slowly .
although the first 30 minute or so are quite believable ,
it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end .
it is highly questionable ,
if a seasoned soldier like lt. water would disobey direct order .
and even if he would ,
if the rest of his platoon would .
they know
he puts them in direct danger ,
and they know
they will certainly die
if they follow him ,
but what the heck 
he is our lt. so let 's do what he says
( despite the direct order 
remember ) .still ,
there are some nice scene in this movie .
they somewhat save a village ,
where the total population is being massacred by the rebel .
well 
they save a dozen villager or so ,
the rest was already killed .
the strange part of it ,
that they did take the truck
which the rebel left behind .
they rather go on foot .
maybe because the road are unsafe ,
but there was no explanation for it .
anyway .
i think
this was what earned the movie
the one point i gave it.what made this movie an insult to the ain
and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldier can kill of so many rebel
without being hurt
or killed themselves .
only near the end they loose a few comrade .
and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more .
can you believe
that ? they fight of an army of so many 
kill hundred of them ,
and only loose a few of themselves .
and they have round and round of ammo .
never run out of it .
grenade and claymore mine 
an m60 machine gun and even an rpg .
where do they get this stuff .
carrying it around or what ?
they even got a laptop
which shows them the activity of enemy rebel .
and this laptop has a battery
which goes on for day .
really ?
who think up this crap.i guess
if you turn off your ain completely and accept
that the rebel are a bunch of idiot ,
you give this movie a high rating .
if not 
skip this one .
it saves you time .
