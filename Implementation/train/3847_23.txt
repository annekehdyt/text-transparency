fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression
when person were having a tough time worldwide finding job
or even finding food to put on the table .
in europe hitler was on the rise 
along with other nationalist/ socialist whackjob .
in the united state seed of the cartel sown with the federal reserve act and the income tax amendment
( 16 )
were beginning to bear fruit
for connected finance capitalist and their dominating secret society .
for the average guy and girl 
time were tough .
enter hollywood with at least some hopeful images\u0097i do not think
we can properly call them propaganda at this point 
even though this particular movie revolves around war-preparatory naval exercise .
the real issue for boy and girl then 
as now 
was how to hook up with the right one 
lead a decent life 
have wonderful child 
with a modicum of grace and elegance .
the odd were long .
