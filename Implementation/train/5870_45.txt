it is not every film 's job
to stimulate you superficially .
i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day .
while this really can not be described as a failure 
the sum of its part remains ambiguous .
that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again .
this is a challenging 
provocative movie
that does not wrap thing up neatly .
the problem with the movie is in its structure .
its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up ,
just as a second ending is tacked on .
though everything is technically dazzling ,
the movie is exactly too long by that unit .
the long-delayed climax of leo 's awakening comes about 20 minute late.great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script ,
but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual idea .
the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging ;
a character is rear-projected
but his own hand in the foreground is not .
the world depicted is deliberate 
treacherous and absurd .
keep your eye peeled for a memorable ,
technically astonishing assassination
that will make your jaw drop.the composition
are stunning .
whomever chose to release the
( out of print )
videotape in the pan and scan format must have never seen it .
where is the dvd ?
it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review .
you should see it at least once .
you get the sense
that von trier bit off more than he could chew ,
but this movie ends up being richer for it .
i suspect
he is familiar with hitchcock 's foreign correspondent
in which devious european also manipulate an american dupe and several welle movie
that take delirious joy in technique as much
as he does .
all von trier movie explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving society .
after zentropa 
von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment toward dreary 
over-rated 
un-nuanced sap
like breaking the wave and dancer in the dark .
