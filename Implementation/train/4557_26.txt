i saw arthur
( the tv series and the book ) year ago and never was fond of the show very much
( if you are a fan of this cartoon 
sorry
if i am spoiling it for you ,
but this is actually what i think )
.lot of person liked it 
but i did not.the school kid character seemed to fought all the time
( especially arther and dw ) ,
they were nice to each other frequently ,
but gradually i got tired of arthur 's complaining attitude toward everyone and his sister dw
( however the name was spelled ) ,
and dw was an adhd
( or add )
-like 4-year-old sister of arthur
who was sometimes demanding
( which could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routine were 
like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc .
) 
arthur 's friend acted like teenager
instead of what they were like in the arthur book ,
and the parent 
well 
they did not care very much.the greatest cartoon was rocko 's modern life 
not arthur
( no offense ) .
