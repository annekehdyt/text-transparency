this god forsaken film is about three dumb millionaire
who gather a bunch of person
to play a deadly game ,
and the winner gets a million dollar .
first of all 
the acting is terrible ,
and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all .
it is not scary in the least bit ,
it is so stupid
that it made me laugh ,
which is why it earned
that 1 star.the movie is not violent at all ,
but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the woman 's east the whole time ,
and some of the character are very annoying and whiny .
plus 
the monster in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary
that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen .
last 
but not least the ending is terrible .
i do not want to give it away ,
in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk .
avoid at all cost ! ! ! !
! not rated
( but should be r )
for nudity 
profanity 
and mild gore .
