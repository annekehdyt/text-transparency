this movie was made for fan of dani
( and cradle of filth ) .
i am not one of them .
i think
he is just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon
( still ,
i am generally not a fan of black metal ) .
but as i was carrying this dvd case
to pay for it ,
i convinced myself ,
that the less authentic something is the more
it try to be convincing .
thus i assumed i am in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background .
now 
that is what i do like.i got home and popped it in .
my patience lasted 15 minute .
awful camera work and disgusting quality .
and that was then
( 2002 ) ,
that it looked like it
was shot using a hi8 camcorder .
i left it on the shelf .
maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovie would create a nice
setting for this ... picture .
after a couple of month i got back to it
( in mentioned surrounding )
and saw half .
then not only the mentioned aspect annoyed me .
my disliking evolved .
i noticed how funny dani
( 1,65m ; 5'5 '' height )
looked in his platform shoe ripping a head of a mugger apart .
( yes 
ripping .
his head apparently had no skull . )
i also found
that this movie may have no sense .
still 
i have not finished it yet ,
so i was not positive.after a couple more try i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of month back ...
( yes 
it took me 5,5 year . )
so - dani in fact was funny as satan/manson/super-evil-man 's helper and the movie did not make sense .
see our bad person employs dani to do bad thing .
he delivers .
why ?
well i guess
he is just very 
very bad .
as a matter of fact
they both are
and that is pretty much it.we have a couple of short story
joined by dani 's character .
my favourite was about a guy ,
who steals someone 's leg ,
because he wants to use it as his own .
yeah 
exactly .
the acting 's rock bottom .
the cgi is the worst ever .
i mean stinger beat it
( and 
boy ,
is stinger 's cgi baaaaad ) .
the story has no sense .
and the quality is ... let 's just say
it is not satisfying .
the only thing
that might keep you
watching is the unmotivated violence and gore .
blood and gut are made pretty well .
why 
you can actually see
that the movie originated there and then moved on .
( example - dani 'the man ' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake
as can be - and gut it ...
and then eats what fell out .
why ?
we never know .
we do know 
however ,
that this cat must have been on illegal substance ,
as his heart is almost half his size .
)
you might think ,
after my comment
that this movie is so bad
it is good ,
but it is just bad .
cradle of filth fan can add 3 point .
i added one for gore .
