i\u00b4m not surprised
that even cowgirls get the blue
if this movie is anything to go by .
i expected something better from uma thurman ,
which was the reason
i suffered my way through this experience in the first place .
an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality .
it\u00b4s just a shame
that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these review .
this movie deserves it .
