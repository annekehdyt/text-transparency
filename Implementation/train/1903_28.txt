butch the peacemaker ?
evidently .
after the violent beginning with spike 
tom and jerry all swinging away at each other 
butch calls a halt
and wants to know why .
it is a good question .
`` cat can get along with dog ,
can not they ? ''
he asks tom ,
who nod his head in agreement .
`` mice can get along with cat 
right ? ''
jerry nod `` no 
''
and then see that is not the right answer.they go inside and butch draws up a `` peace treaty ''
( complete with professional artwork ! ) .
most of the rest 
and the bulk of the cartoon 
is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change-of-pace .
i found it fun to watch .
i can a million of these cartoon
in which every beats each other over the head.anyway ,
you knew
the peace was not going to last .
a big piece of steak spells the death of the `` peace treaty ''
but en route it was nice change
and still had some of usual tom and jerry clever humor .
