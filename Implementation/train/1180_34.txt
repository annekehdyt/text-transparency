`` batman :
the mystery of the batwoman '' is about as entertaining as animated batman movie get.while still true to the feeling of the comic book ,
the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series .
bruce wayne looks much like he has before ,
but now he appears somewhat less imposing .
the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy 
more youthful tim drake robin.kevin conroy 
as usual 
invokes the voice of batman better
than most live action actors.kelly ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job
than i was expecting.as in the live action batman film 
the movie lives or dy
based on the quality of the villain .
my all-time favorite 
the penguin 
is here .
his design is sleeker
than it has appeared before 
hearkening more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the '60 's than the danny devito portrayal of `` batman return . ''
david ogden stier is the perfect choice for the penguin 's voice .
the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate ,
just as he most commonly appears in the comic .
hector elizondo 's voice creates a bane
who 's much more memorable than the forgettable version in `` batman and robin . ''
and finally 
batman has a descent mystery to solve ,
putting the `` detective '' back in `` detective comic ''
( that is what `` dc '' stand for 
after all . )
the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie .
it sounds like a mix between the score from `` poirot '' and the score from `` mission : impossible . ''
all in all ,
it is more entertaining
than your average cartoon .
