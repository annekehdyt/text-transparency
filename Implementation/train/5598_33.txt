this was eddie robinson 's 101st film and his last ,
and he died of cancer nine day
after shooting was complete .
all of which makes his key scene in the movie
all the more poignant.although some of the hair and clothing style are a bit dated
( also note
the video game shown in the film ) ,
but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless .
heston said
he had wanted to make the film for some time
because he really believed in the danger of overpopulation.several thing make this film a classic .
the story is solid.the acting is top-notch 
especially the interplay between heston and robinson 
with nice performance
also by cotten and peters.the music is absolutely perfect .
the medley of beethoven 
grieg 
and tchaikovsky
combined with the pastoral visual element
make for some truly moving scene .
this was the icing on the cake for the film.and the theme
( or the `` point '' )
of the film is a significan not one .
yes 
it is a film about overpopulation ,
but on a more important note it is a cautionary tale about what
can go wrong with man 's stewardship of earth .
it is in the subtext
that you find the real message of the film .
pay attention to what sol says about the `` old day '' of the past
( which is our present ) ,
and note
how thorn is incapable of comprehending what sol is saying.this film is one of my top sci-fi film of all time .
