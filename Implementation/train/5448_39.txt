i have seen romantic comedy
and this is one of the easiest/worst attempt at one .
a lot of the scene work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre .
usually this is okay
because we are dealing with a genre ,
but the challenge generally resides
in making it original 
new and inventive .
this movie fails to do so.there is no sense
of who the character really are 
apart from sylvie moreau 's
( who is the real star of this movie 
not isabelle blais ) .
they fit into this one-dimensional clich\u00e9
and they become nothing more than simple puppet serving the purpose of a very light narrative.the pacing of the movie can become annoying 
rhythm lack ,
and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-up .
i should also mention the overly stylized decor making some scene devoid of any naturally 
or rather ,
making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious .
of course 
along with that 
you have the right-on-cue sappy music
which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.i can not believe
that a movie
who makes obvious woody allen allusion
ends up being this deceptive .
if you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy ,
this is not it .
or rather 
this a poor attempt at it .
you will only leave the theater wondering
why this film has been getting such praise
when cinema is now more than 100 year old
and there are far superior quebecois director
making better flicks.le aimant is a good movie
for what it is .
but it is a bad one
if you regard cinema as an art and director as auteur 's .
