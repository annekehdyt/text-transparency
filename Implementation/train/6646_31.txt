the underground comedy movie 
is possibly the worst train wreck i have ever seen .
luckily i did not pay for this movie ,
and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting
that it was so awful
but he needed to prove to me how awful it was .
i love off color comedy .
i figured at the least it would have
that and i would be entertained .
no ,
instead the acting was so awful ,
the `` joke '' were extremely cheesy ,
and the plot was no where to be found .
maybe there was not supposed to be a plot
so i can not hold that against this movie .
it is pretty sad
where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman
having her head hit off by a bat ... ..by batman ...
a man dressed in a baseball uniform
wielding a bat .
hilarious .
simply genius .
i got the feeling
watching this movie
that its creator made it and laughed hysterically with their friend about it .
perhaps this was full of inside joke
we just did not understand .
or perhaps it is the worst piece of trash ever made
and it should be locked away in a vault
and dumped in the arctic ocean.p.s .
do not buy this movie !
