somehow a woman
working with a scientist puts round metal ball into person 's mouth
that supposedly changes their personality
but in reality turns them into crazed 
zombie-like killer .
the `` guinea pig '' for the experiment are scan notily-clad 
nubile young woman in desperate need of acting lesson .
this movie is awful 
atrocious 
and amazingly bad .
it has little to no logic in the script .
you really will have trouble
following what is going on .
it has no special effect .
the computer screen
that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen .
and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strand of felt hair
( looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it )
named george
that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica
( the leading `` actress '' ) .
throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic 
sophmoric uttering of this puppet .
but wait ... you also get load of softcore 
unerotic 
barely nude scene with the girl with some bar guy .
all the while a most annoying soundtrack play in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery
has taken place .
none of the actor are good .
there are just varying degree of bad .
the gore and `` horror '' aspect are especially ineptly filmed .
the film really looks like an adolescent put it together .
no coincidence henry sala 
the director
by name but not by trade ,
has not made another film .
i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid 
silly 
dreck !
and how bout the ending ?
what happened ?
if you know let me in on the secret
because for the life of me i can not figure it out .
all i know is that i lost the time
spent watching this garbage
that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore !
