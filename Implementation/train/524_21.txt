lynch .
the man has some really great stuff !
he knows how to disturb us ,
then reward us
by getting us
think in different way .
this 
however 
is altogether different .
dumbland 's reward is 1 % absurd comedy ,
earned by enduring 99 % stupidity .
i may have laughed once ,
but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward .
did not miss a thing .
i felt relieved
when it ended ,
and that is part of the point with this series .
it is an annoying series about annoying character in annoying situation ,
rounded out with annoying animation 
voice and sound .
but recognizing this and its other absurdist quality still fails to make dumbland worthwhile .
