an update of the skit and joke you would have seen on a burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th century .
it is a string of several joke
acted out .
some of them you could tell your grandmother 
some of them not ,
but it is a fairly safe bet
she is heard them all before .
for what it tries to be ,
it is not too bad .
before you rent it ,
remember
that
it is an older style of entertainment
and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation .
robin williams has a couple of bit ,
but he is interchangeable with the other player .
