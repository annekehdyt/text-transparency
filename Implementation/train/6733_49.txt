i do not know about you ,
but i have always felt drawn to 'art ' cinema .
the first 'art ' film i managed to get a hold of was peter greenaway 's `` the cook 
the thief 
his wife and her lover '' ,
which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive .
the film was the ultimate paradox 
both beautiful and grotesque ... this is what 'art cinema ' was about ,
exploring intellectual idea and inging the visceral to the screen with purpose .
life 
real life 
can be like living in a madhouse ,
and art expressed shows
it for what it is .
i love movie of all type 
but especially those
that both entertain
and have something to say ,
whether i agree
with it is stance or no ... '' 8 1/2 woman '' ,
is a dry 
clinical 'comedy ' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasy .
there is only a very ief allusion to fellini in the film ,
unlike what the previews have suggested .
the main focus of the film falls on the 'close ' relationship between father and son 
ought together after the mother ' death .
in the early scene of the film the father ' sadness is believable ,
you can feel his pain .
what happens afterward is plain by greenaway standard 
the gathering of the harem 
observation on love and death ,
and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh ... one could argue this ,
but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless .
and the idea
that this could be a comedy
is perplexing to me .
the acting for the most part if fine 
... especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer
( though poor mandy should put her clothe back on )
what the film lacks is a compelling story ,
and the usual greenaway touch of excess
that made his other film
so wonderful to watch .
while filled with moment of insight ,
and the occasional taboo 
`` 8 1/2 woman '' is too cut and paste to be considered art 
too bland to considered 'funny ' ,
and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.save your money ...
i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.4/10
