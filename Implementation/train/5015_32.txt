if you have any kind of heart and compassion for person ,
this is a tough movie to watch 
at least in the second half of it .
it is in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded
( mentally- challenged )
man go off the deep end
after he witnesses this utal act against the child .
it is not pleasant material.however ,
it is a good movie
and the acting is good 
too .
the story will sit with you awhile .
`` dominick '' is the mentally-disabled guy
and is played by tom hulce .
i think
this might be hulce 's best role ever .
he is looked after by a med student 
`` eugene 
''
played by ray liotta ,
who became a star the following year with kevin costner 's `` field of dream .
`` dominick is a goodhearted garbage man
who reads `` hulk '' comic book
and loves wrestling .
he is the type of `` slow '' guy
that you can not help but love and root for to live a happy life .
when he freaks out ,
it is for several good reason and ... well ,
see the film for the whole story .
it is worth your time
but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster
and possibly be very upset at some thing you see .
