i have seen many 
many production of the nutcracker .
now perhaps i viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director ,
but i was disappointed .
i am sure person in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective i
found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a `` motion picture '' .
none of the traditionally `` weird ''
and impressive costume looked like what they were supposed to be
( i.e .
the candy did not look like candy ,
the rat did not look like rat but rather like chocolate kiss 
)
the acting was weak 
perhaps toned down too much for the screen ,
and the choreography just did not do anything for me .
this makes the entire show very satisfactory
( at best ) ,
as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production .
but remember 
again 
this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director 
not a dancer or a choreographer 
but a straight male theatrical director .
