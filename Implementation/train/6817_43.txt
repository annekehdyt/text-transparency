i first saw this movie here in the u.k. in december 1989
when central tv oadcast it .
i still have the video tape 
although worn out
( over the year many friend and family member have borrowed it
and have also been chilled by it ! ) .
anyway 
i remember coming home
that night 
grabbing a christmas tipple 
switching the light out
and watching what was advertised as a 'christmas ghost story ' .
even now i remember certain scene
that still send the hairs on my neck standing on-end ...
i have seen some comment on the movie
which say
it is not this and not that ... i think
those person get scared by friday 13th and the like 
stalk and slash rammel ,
which are laughable .
this is a 'traditional ' ghost story ;
there is no big budget action or special effect ... no swearing 
no blood 
no gratuitous sex scene 
no chainsaws or gun etc ...
so how refreshing ! ! ! !
it is atmospheric .
if you like chilling horror ,
well written ,
well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere ,
this is the movie for you .
i like the original horror ;
only last night i saw the original haunting
and that is a superb movie .
very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black .
the end of the movie differ to the book 
but still very good .
i recommend it .
try it ... you *will* like it if you like traditional ghost story ...
so ... turn off the light ,
turn up the fire 
lock the door 
grab a drink ... and enjoy ... : )
