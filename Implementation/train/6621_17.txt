i enjoyed watching cliffhanger 
at the beginning
when that woman
( sarah )
was full of terror
when she was slipping ,
i thought
that was a terrifying scene
as i would think
that
when you see that see ,
your nerve in your body get to you
because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster .
i did like watching cliffhanger ,
i think
silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think
he will be known as playing rambo and rocky .
