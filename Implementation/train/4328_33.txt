i admit
that i am a vampire addict :
i have seen
so many vampire movie i have lost count
and this one is definitely in the top ten .
i was very impressed by the original john carpenter 's vampire
and when i descovered there was a sequel i
went straight out
and bought it .
this movie does not obey quite the same rule as the first ,
and it is not quite so dark ,
but it is close enough
and i felt
that it built nicely on the original.jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss :
his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe
that he might actually be able to survive in the world
in which he lives .
one of my favourite part was just
after he meets zoey
and wander into the bathroom of the diner
to check
to see
if she is more than she seems .
his comment are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical
which contrast well with the rest of the scene
as it unfolds.the other cast member were also well chosen
and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film .
it is not simply a rehash of the first movie
and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night .
there are different element
which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.if
you like vampire movie i would recommend this one .
if you prefer your film less bloody then choose something else .
