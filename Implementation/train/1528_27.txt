this is a funny film .
it has all the usual disney component
( music 
great range of character 
story 
appeal ) ,
entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talent of less well known actor as those
in say `` antz '' and `` price of egypt '' .the character work really well ,
and have a strong appeal ,
and the humour is aimed at a wide level
which overcomes generational barrier .
the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format ,
which adds to the cinema experience.call me crazy ,
but i have seen the film three time ,
and i intend on taking more friend to see it this weekend .
many skeptic have seen this film on my recommendation
and not been disappointed .
i work in a multiplex ,
and i can honestly say
that no-one has ever walked out of this movie
without a sense of satisfaction.see it ,
and do not be put off
because it is animated .
you are sure to enjoy this movie ,
and make sure you stay for the end credits !
the blooper and out-take at the end are the funniest part of the film ,
which is packed with laugh throughout .
