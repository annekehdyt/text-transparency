wow 
i just saw this on t.v .
as one of the `` scary '' movie
they show around halloween .
was this rated g ?
there was not really anything to make this movie scary 
or worth watching .
also 
other person say
this is a spoof ,
but i do not think so .
for a spoof 
you need something called `` humor '' .
this low-budget crap-fest did not have a shred of humor ,
and it did not make much sense 
either .
you basically have a goofy looking monster
( man in rubber suit )
coming out of closet ,
killing person 
i guess ,
since you never see the monster
doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath .
the spinning newspaper tell you
that person were killed by the monster ,
so i guess
that is good enough.the military try feebly to kill the monster ,
which is not much larger than a man .
they have very bad aim .
then the military flee !
wow 
did this movie make the u.s. military look pathetic or what ?
the monster ,
while hard to kill ,
does not do much besides shuffle around and roar .
oh 
and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks .
it was a slightly interesting ,
yet a total alien ripoff.what was the deal with the scientist
playing the xylophone
to attract the monster ?
it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality .
also 
why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ?
why did not the monster go into the closet
when it had a chance ?
why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ?
