i had never seen
richard thomas play a bad guy .
i was not sure i would like him this way .
and i was not sure
he could pull it off .
but this astounded me .
he sent shiver up my spine
and caused me to take a closer look at street person .
the movie is engrossing and fast paced .
bruce davison is convincing
but all he can really play is a nice guy .
the real talent here is thomas .
the ending was a little clumsy
but perhaps that is the way
real person would fight ...
if you are a thomas fan
you must see him here at his best being bad !
