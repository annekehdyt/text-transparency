this amusing bug bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k-9 the green dog.this time
instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land ,
capture an earth creature
and take it back to mar .
of course the creature
he picks
is bug bunny .
at first bug thinks marvin and k-9 are trick
or treating
but realises this can not be right
when marvin drastically enlarges bug 's rabbit hole with a ray-gun .
bug try to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of way ,
including persuading marvin
that k-9 is planning a mutiny .
eventually he is captured using an acme strait-jacket ejecting bazooka .
amazingly 
for an acme product 
it works
as advertised and bug 's is forced to use his wit
to get k-9 to release him ,
the table are soon turned
and the two disgruntled martian are trussed up
and bug is trying to fly their saucer back to earth.i really enjoyed this
although the ending is a little weak
compared to the rest of the story .
marvin 's voice has changed slightly here
and he gets visible emotional
when he is angry
but this did not make me like him or the cartoon any less .
