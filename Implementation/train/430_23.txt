i have been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrase about `` teenager seduce and kill man in his house '' and such .
i think
i first saw part of this film
when i was about 10 year old
when it was running on cable .
it made quite an impression !
it is the kind of film
that kid know
they should not be watching ,
and switch the channel when their parent come in .
when i saw
who the cast was ,
i could not believe
that some of these good actor were in such a horrible movie .
then again ,
if you like to see man
who cheat on their wife get murdered ,
then this is an interesting film .
also 
if i recall 
there is some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian momants .
probably the dumbest ending of all time ,
but still ... memorable .
