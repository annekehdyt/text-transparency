i thought
that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the life of mary-kate 's and ashley 's character sam and emma stanton !
they are both trying to make both themselves and their parent happy but ; unfortunately ,
it is just not that easy for them to actually do !
i thought
that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie
and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young lady
then i am sure
that you will agree with me here !
if you have not seen this movie
yet then i say you really missed-out ; big time ,
and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now !
this movie is a real winner !
sincerely
