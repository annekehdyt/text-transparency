if you have read the original novel ,
as i did ,
you will probably hate this thing.the film version of _absolute beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronism
attempting to create a `` period piece '' set in the late 1950 and failing to re-create or even pay homage to that period
-- the us monstrosity of _dirty dancing_ does similar to 1963 ,
except that film proved financially successful despite
having equally amateurish screen writing .
in addition to suffering from `` looking too 1980s '' ,
the character have been changed 
re-arranged ,
and downplayed to the point
that the only characteristic they have in common with those of the novel
are the slightest superficial look and 
of course 
their name :
suze is transformed from the narrator 's flighty ex-girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile
who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money
( at her own admittance in the first few page )
into a hapless and naive `` eve '' -archetype seduced by fame and glamour 
exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss ,
who surprisingly was not given a van dyke and pointy hairstyle .
she and the narrator 
re-named `` colin ''
( after the book 's author 
colin macinne )
for the film 
are also in a relationship.big jill 's character 
a lesbian seemingly butch yet `` fop like '' in her mid-20s
who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble-headed lesbian 
and one of the narrator 's closest friend 
dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator 
is reduced to a sort of `` named extra '' with only a few throw-away line 
and tonne of comical outfits.the fabulous hoplite 
a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel 
is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film 
camped-up and all but ignored.the narrator 's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film 
he is played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood 
and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator 's mum seems 
for all practical purpose 
ignored.in its favour 
the music
( for what it is )
is well-composed ,
and you have to give the production
and writing crew credit for actually taking a line from the book
( `` ... some day 
they will write musical about the 1950 ... '' )
as their inspiration to write a musical ,
but in the world of bad camped-up musical 
this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch .
unlike _shock treatment_ or _starstruck_ crucial plot element are treated as afterthought .
unlike _the apple_ 
there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical number
and spoken dialogue.you really can not blame
it is `` too 1980s '' feel on the fact
that it was created in the 1980s .
the film version of _annie_ released in 1981 ,
pays a wonderfully well-executed tribute to the look and feel of new york city in the 1930s 
and _napolean dynamite_ manage to capture a gritty sort of look
and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003
( though it is not explicitly set in the 1980s 
those
who lived through the decade
can not deny
that the film `` feels very 1980s '' ) .
obviously 
it was _possible_ to make something good out of this ,
especially considering the iconic status
that the source novel has in the uk ,
but it fails most apparently in the look and feel ,
and also in its treatment of the source material ,
which is downright disrespectful.perhap
if you have not read
and have no intention of reading the novel ,
you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism
giving a shameful parody of late-1950 soho london 's modernist jazz set .
i can definitely see what the writing team were attempting ,
but they definitely could have done better .
with boy george as a household name and mixed-race musician
and band on the chart in 1986 uk ,
they definitely did _not_ need to bowdlerise the character in the way
that they ended up doing .
in fact 
i would go so far as saying
that the writer wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly
-- it ended up having a bunch of adult cranking out crap
and treating its targeted teen-aged audience like two-bit idiot
to make a quick buck off of .
