i feel
monarch cove was one of the best written
and acted out `` drama '' series to come on any network in a long time .
this show had great potential
and i could not wait to view it each week .
this could be developed into a great primetime soap .
person look forward to this type of acting
as we are being `` reality tv '' overkilled .
i long for the type of writing
and acting
that show like dalla 
knot ' landing 
dynasty 
melrose place 
etc .
provided .
monarch cove updated this concept quite well and i anticipated
it only getting better .
there is so much to expand on with these character
and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right .
it would be a loss to not explore this and develop these character after having drawn
and hooked us into their world .
i absolutely loved this show
because it was mysterious 
interesting and sensuous
without going overboard or offending .
loved it .
