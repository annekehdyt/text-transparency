or maybe that is what it feels like .
anyway 
`` the bat person '' is about as flat as a rug 
bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as all three combined.okay 
plot in a nutshell
( fitting vessel 
that ... ) :
a doctor
( moss )
gets bitten by a bat
while checking out a cave with his wife
( mcandrew )
and subsequently turns into a bat - well ,
not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature
that looks more like a werewolf
who kills his victim in a first-person camera viewpoint ... .but
then there is the business of the sheriff
( pataki ) ,
who is about the worst kind of sheriff :
the hick kind .
he hassles person ,
he leers at married woman ,
he steals handkerchief from haberdashery
( the fiend !
) 
he smokes with one of those cigarette holder in his mouth and talk at the same time ,
making him look and sound like buford t. justice in `` smokey and the bandit ''
and ( this is the worst part ) ...
he is the most likeable character in the whole film !
the whole film 
though 
is just tv movie-of-the-week-like crapola
( guano 
in this case ) .
it is an aip 
for crying out loud !
what did you expect 
oscar caliber stuff ?
and what else can you say about a film
that not even mst3k can save ?
how about ... no star for `` the bat person '' 
full version or mst3k version ! by the way ,
if there is ever a sequel for this movie ,
i am burying my tv .
