this cartoon is short on plot ,
but is a visually stunning piece of work .
there will be very 
very minor spoiler :
this short has a `` story ''
that is incredibly slight-gnome underground are responsible for the return of spring each year ,
yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw .
both the gnome and the storm have their own song .
that is pretty much the plot ,
such as it is .
but this cartoon is not about the plot-it is about the color and animation .
the visual are exceptional .
back in 1936 
such ight color was still something of a novelty
and there is some incredibly inspired work here.my favorite moment of the short surround the movement of the liquefied color through pipe .
at more than one point 
there are a series of pipe
aligned in a row ,
from the shortest to the tallest and the color move through the pipe and the musical track makes it seem
as though the row is a pipe organ.the visual of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm
which refuses to leave quietly
are exceedingly well executed .
these type of short were thing
which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for ,
but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm ,
because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided
that they could control cost better
if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost
than harman and ising were.this is truly a beautiful cartoon
and is well worth seeing .
it is available on the dvd attack of the '30s character .
recommended ,
particularly if you like good animation .
