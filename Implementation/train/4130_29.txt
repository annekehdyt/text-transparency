this is one of my favorite along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing `` sandy ''
and the agne moorhead-and-the-tiny-spaceman episodes.it is an important take 
from mid-1961 
on the long cold war
that the u.s. was then emoiled in .
the beaten-down city-scene 
the near-starving character ' sparse dialog 
their threadbare uniform 
and the minimal action `` says ''
it all :
the absurdity of an on-going conflict
that threatens to destroy human life 
modern civilization 
and all
that is sweet and redeeming about it.it is a `` fable ''
because it was made in a time in which 
had event turned out differently 
such as the second berlin crisis
( spring 1961 )
and the subsequent cuban missile crisis
( oct. 1962 ) ,
it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u.s. 's major city 
ruined and replete with a few miserable survivor .
i also see it as a `` fable ''
because it is not only a cautionary tale ,
but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myth :
it is a love story ,
set in an impossible situation ,
and involving two highly mismatched lover .
