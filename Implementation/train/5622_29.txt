i do not know
what it is about donald sutherland 's acting style 
or vocal style ,
but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex .
he is just ... i do not know 
thick ?
somnambulistic ?
on med ?
weird.that said ,
i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release ,
and frankly 
i do not remember
it ending anything like that .
a bad ending 
too ,
because nothing gets tied off .
what about the dead husband ?
the annoying child
( and was the kid dubbed ? ) ?
the scotland yard and military pursuer ?
i would have liked something wrapping thing up
and giving some dramatic closure
to it all 
not just the big panoramic pull-away.and what woman sleeps with the man
she knows
just killed her husband ?
even if she was trying to allay needle 's suspicion to protect her kid ,
she could always have had a headache .
that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable ...
