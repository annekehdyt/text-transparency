my father 
dr. gordon warner
( ret .
major 
us marine corps ) 
was in guadalcanal
and lost his leg to the japanese ,
and also received the navy cross .
i was pleasantly surprised to learn
that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping
that he had an impact on the film
in making it resemble how it really was back then ,
as i read in various comment
written by the viewer of this film
that it seemed like real-life .
my father is a fanatic of fact and figure ,
and always wanted thing to be seen
as they were so i would like to believe
he had something to do with that.he currently lives in okinawa 
japan 
married to my mother for over 40 year
( ironically 
she is japanese ) ,
and a few year ago was awarded one of the highest commendation from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activity of inging back kendo and iaido to japan
since mcarthur banned them
after wwii.my father was once a marine
but i know
that once you are a marine ,
you are always a marine .
and that is exactly what he is and i love
and respect him very much.i would love to be able to watch this film
if anyone will have a copy of it .
and i would love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year !
