i like monster movie 
generally .
even if they are implausible and silly .
but its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly
and tries to take itself seriously all at the same time .
like in a really posh kind of way.while the idea is somewhat factual ,
like orca are known for killing great white shark ,
its really hard to find it scary
when i can not help but just see an angry shamoo
destroying stuff .
especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the orca 's doing ...
and while it explodes ,
the thing jumps out of the water
and it felt
like i was watching a show at sea world with firework .
plus they kill a lot of the scary moment
before they even hint
that they are going to happen .
on top of that 
it takes a few jabs at jaws .
its like `` hey look 
we are being factual
and we can come up with better reason
why the orca is attacking ''
.yes you are ,
ignoring your outrageous **** up in logic of course .
but jaws had one thing
your movie does not .
its scary .
yes its implausible .
yes its somewhat outrageous .
but quite frankly 
factual or not 
a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white .
and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more .
even jaws the revenge is scarier than this .
