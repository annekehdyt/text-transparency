never viewed this film
and consider it a great classic with great veteran actor .
in the period
that this film was made ,
person in america were different ,
there was no tv or all the modern thing
we have today ,
except the radio and the starting out of great film being made in hollywood .
sweet innocent tale of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently
than it is today .
ann shirley 
'' murder my sweet '' 
'44 played a young orphan gal
who was called carrot top
because of her red hair
and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folk ,
who were like two wise owls
and watched over ann shirley .
it was a small town
and everyone knew everyone
and if anything happened ,
the entire town found out about it within minute .
it is a down to earth film with nice decent person
trying to help each other in a very very simple way
of living .
today 
it seems very corn ball and stupid ,
but believe me ,
this was the way
person were in america during the 1920 ' .
and 30 's and they were a great generation
that loved good family film .
