in a way 
this film reminded me of `` jumping jack flash '' .
remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine ?
whoopi zonked out tranquilizer ?
whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger ?
great moment captured on film for sure
but the movie still kind of suck 
right ?
that is how i feel about `` rich in love '' .
a man hears his wife sing for the first time .
post-coital teenager talk about the nature of love .
albert finney eat ice cream out of bucket
and 
in another scene 
has a lovely waking moment
regarding his absent wife .
alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe .
but there is only the whisper of a plot here
and you can not wait for it to get moving .
only when ex-go-gos ' charlotte caffey 's the grace revs up a great pop song does
the picture wake up ...
and then it is over !
this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer 's day in the deep american south .
