how can a movie be both controversial and gentle ?
this one does it with a near-perfect structure .
no one wants their daughter to be athlete .
apparently most culture do not want their daughter
to be small-easted 
either .
here we see a bunch of superb actor
we have never heard of before portray folk of different culture
living fairly humdrum life
until their female child want to ,
and have the potential to 
become professional soccer player .
the structure around the parallelism of the two culture is wonderful .
there is no condescension .
both culture are seen as modern and valid .
( and yes ,
both are silly 
too ) .
one flaw :
the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundred of relative but not one child among them .
