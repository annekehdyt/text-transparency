simply put 
oliver !
is one of the greatest musical of all time .
it is filled with memorable song - `` food glorious food '' 
`` oliver !
`` 
`` consider yourself '' and `` oom-pah-pah '' to name just a few -
and equally memorable character.the film is a musical adaptation of charle dicken ' classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself ,
it is a perfect family film .
there are some frightening moment
- the villain bill syke
played by oliver reed
is scary enough on his own - but overall ,
the film will appeal to child of all age as well as adults.the story -
which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolf around a little orphan boy
named oliver and his life growing up in london .
at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphan
but after daring to question mr. bumble 
the overseer 
he is sold to a family as a servant.after a series of mishap and close shave ,
he meets the artful dodger - superbly
played by a young jack wild ,
who gives his all in the role - and through him 
the greedy fagin
( ron moody ) ,
who trains young boy to pick pocket treasure
which he keeps for himself.the film
was shot solely in studio and on soundstage at shepperton film studio
but this does not translate at all to film .
the set perfectly replicate victorian london ,
as do the costume worn by the character .
a multi-oscar winner and a massive success on its release 
oliver !
is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time
and will delight anyone
who loves film .
