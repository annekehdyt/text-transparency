gymkata is without a doubt
one of the worst movie ever made .
but not the bad kind of bad movie .
this one is so awful
it is fun to watch and laugh .
kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting .
he should go back to gymnastic .
but who can forget such memorable scene as the high bar with chalk 
the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazy in slow motion .
i do not think
it was meant to be this bad ,
but who can tell .
it is not art ,
but if you want something lite and fluffy
that will make a good conversation 
rent gymakta .
makes for an evening of fun .
