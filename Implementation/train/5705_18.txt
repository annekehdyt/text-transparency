actually this movie has silly moment 
both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and child part ,
and it is much worse than other mj movie like `` the wiz '' 
`` captain eo '' and `` ghost '' .
but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven year ,
( yeah ,
that is half my life ,
you guys !
) 
i can not complain too much about it .
just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me .
but as a movie 
it is not good at all ,
and i am afraid ,
that it would get a much lower grade for me ,
if my darling mike had not been the one starring in it .
but since no one but mike is the moonwalker ,
it has to get a 7/10 from me .
