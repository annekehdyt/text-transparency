this movie is fun to watch .
if you liked `` dave '' with kevin klein ,
you will get a kick out of this .
think
`` dave '' gone south american
as dreyfus play jack noah 
an actor between job ,
who is hand selected by the head of the island nation of parador 's secret police ,
to replace the drunken sot of a dictator 
alfonse simms ,
after he has had a heart attack and died .
noah bumble along 
aided in his role by the ex-dictator 's mistress ,
as they attempt to thwart the plan of raul julia .
jonathan winter also makes an appearance as a hearty american \u00e9migr\u00e9
who turns out to be cia .
also starring polly holiday and fernando rey .
there are a few absurd moment
such as the body of the old dictator be kept frozen for a year ,
and the final scene ,
where sonia braga ,
who has bee cradling the bloody ,
bullet riddled body of dreyfus is seen moment later all in pristine white 
with nary a smudge on her .
but all in all it is a great romp .
