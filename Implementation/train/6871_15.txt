this film is just a kid against evil genre .
thunderbird is just the hook
to get person to see it ,
but are almost incidental in use .
the fact
that the action takes place on tracy island
is just a ploy to pull in the public .
it was interesting to note what the film maker view of future london will be
and how the world all fits together.the best part of this film are some of the line
delivered by lady penelope
which are highly comical .
these provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the tv series.having
said
that it passes 90 or so minute in a 'fun ' way
and so may just be worth watching .
