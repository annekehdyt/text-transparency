i will not give anything away
by describing the plot of this film other
than to say
that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman
whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide .
it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out
why her friend ended her life .
as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates ,
it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion .
the film is expertly paced and the acting 
especially by talia sharon as ya'ara 
the blind woman 
is excellent .
israeli film has definitely come of age
and is now fully competitive with other foreign film ,
though few have found a large audience in the u.s .
