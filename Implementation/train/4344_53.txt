when this was released ,
i thought
this was one of the most profane film ever made .
however 
thank to martin scorcese and a few other filmmaker like him 
there have been mainline film worse 
language-wise ,
than this ... .but this is a pretty utal assault on one 's ears .
hey 
i can take a lot of it ,
but this got ridiculous .
in the first six minute alone 
i heard a half-dozen usage 's of the lord 's name in vain plus an untold number of f-word .
i wonder
how many person walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 ?
i could not have been the only one.not surprisingly 
some of the feature actor included jennifer jason-leigh 
burt young 
jerry orbach and rikki lake .
since this film 
stephen lang seems to have improved his image 
at least playing the godly `` stonewall '' jackson in `` god and general . ''
lang 's role here is just the opposite :
perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character
who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.depressing 
gloomy 
semi-pornographic 
repulsive :
these are just a few of the adjective person
used - even some liberal critic - in describing this story ,
which is painted even worse in the novel .
of course 
some of the better-known critic 
all extreme libs 
praised the movie .
however 
they were the only one .
most critic were disgusted ,
as well almost all of the paying public .
it is unbelievable
that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.trust me on this :
there are no good 
likable character in this entire movie .
this is a mean 
sick film :
one of the worst of the `` modern era . ''
that is ,
unless you enjoy seeing child abuse ,
drug abuse 
teen prostitute 
on and on - two straight hour of nothing but atrocity
and just plain evil person .
no thank .
