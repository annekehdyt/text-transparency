there is absolutely nothing in this movie
that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent .
nobody in it has ever tried acting before 
even the extra in the coffee shop look
as if
they have been glued in place .
nothing looks rehearsed.the film quality is terrible .
most of the 'action ' takes place in narrow corridor or apartment with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought 
swinging some cheapo camera backward and forward between 'actor '
as they deliver their line .
no tripod and no proper microphone either ,
there sound quality is terrible .
even 'manos ' fare better than this 
at least they had proper equipment .
what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.stick to home video ,
preferably
made by some 5 year kid
trying out the video feature on daddy 's new camera phone .
you will be in for a long search
to find a movie more inept than this .
