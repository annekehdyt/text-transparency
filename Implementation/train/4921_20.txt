oh dear ! what a disappointment .
i have been watching old western on british tv for decade ,
and i was not aware of this one
until its showing yesterday -
most other scott western come around every few year or so
and are usually worth watching again.the rich colour and outdoor set were good ,
but that is all i can say about this film .
i have to agree with most of the other negative comment
already made .
several time i felt like turning it off ,
and finally i did 
halfway through ,
something i hardly ever do.scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girl ,
his two sidekick were annoying
and so was the mexican bandit lad .
and i have a feeling
the army uniform were 20 year or so too modern ,
not that this has bothered maker of many other western.perhaps
it got better in the second half ,
but i could not be bothered to wait and see .
