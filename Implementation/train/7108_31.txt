the film picks up after last year remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert
where the attack in the first film happened .
the crew is killed not long before a group of soldier on a training exercise show up
to find no one around .
you can fill in the rest.this is a paycheck picture all around .
there seems to be no passion in anyone 's performance 
nor in anyone behind the camera .
this is a movie
that was made for the money and nothing else .
on some level this should have worked ,
it could have been a more horrific southern comfort
( where national guardsman run afoul of some person in the swamp ) ,
but instead its not much of anything .
in large part you can blame the script ,
written unbelievably in part by wes craven ,
which hits the same old target again and again .
add to the mess the fact
that the direction is dull
and the set up of sequence is so lack luster
as to remove any inherent tension in any scene.it
not bad as such 
but badly made and dull .
let me put my feeling into context :
the reason
i saw this film
was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kid flick the last mimzy and i wanted to see what caused the out cry
( i mean the film have so much in common-he says
sarcastically ) .
i am convinced
that this film will only scare those
who like the last mimzy .
