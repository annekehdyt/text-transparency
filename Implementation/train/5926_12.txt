i too have gone thru very painful personal loss
( twice )
and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality
of that experience very well 
life out of balance ,
nothing makes sense 
well meaning relative 
etc ...
it was nice to see ally again .
she is one of my all time favorite movie actors.i laughed and cried as the story unfolded .
great story and cast .
well done !
