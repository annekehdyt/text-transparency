`` igor and the lunatic '' is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie .
apparently even nearly twenty year later ,
charle manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmaker .
this is a typical troma production ,
meaning in other word ,
there is a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage
to accompany the nonsensical plot .
there is a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display \u0096
which is not bad \u0096
but it is all so very pointless and ugly
that it becomes frustrating to look at .
`` igor and the lunatic '' is so desperate
that it is even using a lot of the footage twice ,
like the circle saw killing for example .
the incoherent plot try to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul .
one of paul 's lower ranked disciple ,
named igor ,
becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible story and drug orgy
and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity .
just to illustrate through a little example
exactly how crazy igor is :
he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl !
there is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack
and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera trick 
like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequence .
maybe there is one sequence
that more or less qualify as worthwhile for trash fanatic and that ' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete .
for no particular reason 
the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole second .
