wow 
what a snoozer .
definately one of bacon 's worst film .
the bad acting coupled with a formulatic ,
if not incredulous 
script make me yearn for time i wasted on viewing this on cable television back .
not really much i can say about it 
a basketball scout gets too attached to the person
he is recruiting ,
who happens to belong to a tribe
that happens to be on the verge of war
which happens to be decided by ( spoiler )
a basketball game .
grade :
f+
