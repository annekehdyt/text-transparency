this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movie
and is one of the best .
at the same time 
it looks realistic and unrealistic ,
just knowing
that the movie is fake .
the story is about a woman
who got captured
and is tortured in a lot of different way .
a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter
without a return address ,
and it includes a manga video ,
showing the torture .
the man
who capture her
are testing the limit of a human
before they die .
some scene are shocking ,
such as the eyeball scene and other are not shocking like the girl
being punched 100 time ,
because you see punch in nearly every movie .
this movie has a lot of gore
so i would recommand this to person 17 or older.9/10
