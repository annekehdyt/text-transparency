it is hard to believe
that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame 
with x-file 
one of the best sci-fi series ever ,
being at the top of the glory .
nine year later he is almost forgotten ,
and his tentative to make it on the big screen failed miserably .
i can not even explain why ,
he is a fair actor ,
but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role
that takes big talent to eak from.at the same time angelina jolie
was much less known ,
and she was really lucky
that a film like 'playing god ' did not led her career into a dead-end .
fortunately for her 
'the bone collector ' and 'girl 
interrupted ' were waiting beyond the corner ,
and
when lara croft came 
her career was launched.there is not too much to be told about this film .
it is the only big screen film of andy wilson ,
and there must be a reason .
all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor
who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar
only to find himself working for the mob .
the off-screen voice is especially bad 
with a moralistic text
that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film .
you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental store 
or on tv .
try to look for something better .
