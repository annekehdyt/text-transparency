indian cinema typify cop of two oad category :
they are either the honest type or the bad guy .
the honest guy always shout at the top of their voice
and fight the system
while the bad cop enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.this movie at least eaks this usual formula
and gives a refreshing view of cop and their life .
the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop
who .
the music is interesting
and the editing is a trend setter
as far as indian cinema goes.the movie is slow at time and the dilemma
which anbu faces
when it comes to maya
is overplayed at time .
but i would still give this one 9/10 simply
because it has many first to its credit .
