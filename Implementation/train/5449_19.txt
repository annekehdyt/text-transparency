zentropa is the most original movie
i
have seen in year .
if you like unique thriller
that are influenced by film noir ,
then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbuster clogging the theater these day .
von trier 's follow-up
like breaking the wave
have gotten more acclaim ,
but this is really his best work .
it is flashy
without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor .
it is too bad
he decided handheld camera were the wave of the future .
it is hard to say
who talked him away from the style
he exhibits here ,
but it is everyone 's loss
that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead .
