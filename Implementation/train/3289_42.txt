you know ,
i went to see `` the hill have eye 2 '' wanting to like it .
i really enjoyed the original ,
and the remake was fairly entertaining .
they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effect the second time around .
even though i still prefer the original film ,
the remake was done well ,
and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me .
bloody 
intense 
and great special effect .
in short 
a great popcorn movie for any horror fan.which ings us to `` the hill
have eye 2 '' .
man ,
where do i start ?
the plot 
or lack of one 
is paper thin .
we are not exactly eaking new ground here.the military has decided to monitor the area ,
and all of these person turn up missing .
so what do we do now ?
let 's send in the national guard to investigate .
in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest ,
and worst soldier ever seen .
gee 
i have never seen that premise before .
to make a long story short ,
you have the mutant killing off the moron soldier one at a time in graphic fashion .
once again the special effect by nicotero are great ,
but the kill no matter how graphic become boring 
and predictable .
honestly it seemed to me
that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck .
it was bloody 
and graphic ,
but i found it predictable 
boring 
and not scary at all .
for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought.wes craven and his son shared the writing duty ,
and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror film ,
but sadly this is not one of them .
