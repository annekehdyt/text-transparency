there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar 's mystical play
-- farrell look good in his title role 
but his line reading 
frankly 
stink .
this also suffers 
in large part 
from this being credited as the first movie
that makes use of rear projection .
the set look phony.there are two great strength in this show 
however :
although the dialogue reading limp 
the visual performance are perfect .
rose hobart 
as julie 
is little remembered today :
mostly for rose hobart ,
in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her :
credit melford 's stylish visual direction of the original .
her great beauty and simple
( although stagy )
performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound section of this movie.however ,
one of borzage 's theme is the mystical power of love ,
and it is the handling of the celestial section
that make this great ,
from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the hot place ' .
h.b .
warner 's performance here is 
as always ,
perfect.so we have here a flawed but very interesting version .
i think
that lang 's 1934 version is better 
as well as the celestial scene in the henry king version of carousel 
the watered-down musical remake .
but i still greatly enjoyed this version
and think
you should give it a chance .
