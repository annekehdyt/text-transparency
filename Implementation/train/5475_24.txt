the script for `` scary movie 2 '' just was not ready to go .
this is a problem with the film
that is blatantly evident 
to the actor and the audience alike .
director keenan ivory wayan 
and many of the actor are funny person ;
and so the movie is not completely humorless .
to their credit 
the film has several funny moment .
but as a whole 
`` scary movie 2 '' is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.the first `` scary movie '' was a laugh a minute film .
it turned the smallest subtlety of the slasher film genre into comedic gold .
the humor in `` scary movie 2 '' is as heavy handed
as it is un-original .
they even miss obvious opportunity for parody .
two of the movie star are former cast member of `` beverly hill 90210 
''
and this was a show
that was begging to be parodied !
in the final analysis 
`` scary movie 2 '' is like a fine bottle of wine
that was opened far too soon .
the script needed a lot more time to age .
2 star out of 5 .
