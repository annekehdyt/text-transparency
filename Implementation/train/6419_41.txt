memoir of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie ,
there is no doubt about that .
and the acting is generally excellent ,
at least in term of how it portrays the character
as they are scripted.however ,
so many detail small and large are just _wrong_
that it just bother me too much to be able to enjoy it fully .
a small detail
that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sort is one scene
( no this does not spoil anything )
where mameha ring a bell
that hangs at the door of the house
where sayuri lives 
on a snowy winter day .
the bell she is ringing is a fuurin 
or wind chime -
that is only left hanging outside of house in japan in the summer !
person in traditional japanese home did not have doorbell -
they just opened the door and announced themselves .
( you may think
this is such a trivial detail ,
but i would equate this to a movie
made about america
where a christmas wreath is hanging on the door in july
and no one thinks anything of it . )
and do not even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyle
given to the maiko and geisha ,
which is vaguely pan-asian/chinese/kung-fu-ish 
and nothing like real thing .
i think
this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture
they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitude and the portrayal of person and situation too .
so 
i suppose
that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in kyoto
( which is what `` miyako '' is ) ,
then i suppose the more you will enjoy this .
i honestly think
this movie could have been so much better ...
as it is ,
it is just another hollywood version of `` exotic japan '' .
