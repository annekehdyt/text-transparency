this movie was rather awful vipul shah 's last movie was good this one was just bad
although it is a good story
and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia
who adapted this movie from another gujarati play `` avjo wahala fari malishu ''
made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hour to watch there are a lot of flaw in this movie
but it is still a entertainer song are rather bleaked out
and do not work well
but they are still good overall not a movie
you would enthusiastically watch
it is still a story
to take in to account
and it is good
if you are the relationship type pretty good movie with load of flaw and humor
that is really not needed even one bit
