i can only echo the praise of the other review here .
it is a delightful film with a feelgood factor
that it achieves
without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality .
naturally sweet - no added sugar.one small point :
it seems to me
that the mild objection
raised about ustinov 's character pendelton
being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact
that pendelton is clearly a genius/savant at this sort of thing .
yes 
the film was pretty computer illiterate ,
but it did show pendelton 'studying computer ' at his flat ,
and i believe
the implication was supposed to be
that his gift allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject ,
practically overnight.there were a few odd moment
when it appeared in some scene
that gnatpole was trying to test pendelton 's knowledge and call his bluff .
i am not sure
whether we were supposed to believe
that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situation ,
or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough
to pass the test -
it was a little unclear.certainly
he had to know enough
to set up the dummy account .
presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computer worked in those day ,
and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at ,
it is necessary to know quite what their concept was .
they knew
there was something about 'procedure '
which was important ;
they thought
that the 'smart light ' could actually control security 
rather than just indicate its state ;
they thought
that the ( dumb ) user terminal 's feature would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself -
though apart from thing like graphic feature i do not see it meself.mostly ,
i think
they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operation as far
as they could ,
and they did that rather well .
allowing them a bit of artistic license ,
i do not think
their effort had any flaw worthy of note.cd
