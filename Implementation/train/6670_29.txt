this subject matter deserves a much better script ,
and final result ,
than this movie serves up .
the script is full of hole
because it was never conceived as a story 
but rather a string of nightmare scenario
loosely knitted together .
the gap and loose end in the story line are numerous .
the scene where the kidnap victim is told
that her parent are not dead ,
and have been looking for her since
she was taken ,
is just bizarre .
it is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaway handing her a `` missing poster ''
from when she was eight .
in the real world ,
if the head of a shelter for runaway found out
that he had ,
under his roof 
a solved kidnapping ,
what would have followed
would have been an immediate call to the police .
it is a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah .
everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift
that i can only conclude
that the first 90 minute was for pure gratuitous exploitation .
funny 
that is what this movie is supposed to be condemning .
in the end it seems to have joined in .
