i will keep this short
as a movie like this does not deserve a full review.given the setting ,
this movie could have been something really special .
it could have been another `` 28 day later '' or even a `` blair witch project ''
the first 20 or so minute of the movie i was really excited ,
directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense ,
although i do not think
he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground.character were a big let down .
our `` heroine '' in this movie is a worthless piece of crap ,
and you really do not care
if she dies or not .
as many person have said
before 
i was rooting for the homeless person and the black guy ,
who managed to give me a chuckle or two
( whether intentional of the writer or not )
.the main villain 
is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie ,
but
when he is revealed
i was really disappointed .
i will not spoil it but lets just say
my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.all in all this is just another mediocre horror film
which falls into the trap
of following a simple hollywood formula .
this film had a lot of potential
but really failed to hit the mark.just
to highlight
how lame this movie was ,
the character in this movie had at least five time
to finish off
and kill the main villain .
instead they run away .
