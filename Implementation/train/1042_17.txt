if you delete the first twenty minute or so of this film ,
you will be left with a fantastic comedy .
as it is ,
i still found it to be a pretty good movie ,
which is no small feat
considering the coma i was put in by the opening scene .
to put it mildly ,
this film has a dreary beginning
that was not even remotely funny 
or even upbeat .
once thing get sillier 
however 
you are left with a comedy
that still holds up well after more than three decade .
definitely worth checking out ,
especially if you are a younger fan of lemmon and matthau
who wants to see their earlier work .
