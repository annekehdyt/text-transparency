can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluation
as to simply say
`` i liked it '' ?
it is reasonably funny by bit ,
it got great star
and it is gorgeous to look at .
the song
( there are about two
which are then repeated )
are forgettable ,
but they get a healthy ironic treatment
( such as the terribly handsome mr fairbank exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered ) ;
there is not much dancing with all the 1861 crinoline draped around miss grable ,
and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed ,
but the result still is very uplifting .
the photography
( including real outdoor shot
which are a thrill )
is amazing ,
playing around with different shade of lush heavy gold .
miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side ,
but still fresh and comfortable in this continental `` olde worlde '' comedy .
it is pretty much along the line of `` down to earth '' with rita hayworth ,
and that one tends to be rather disliked by many .
so i suppose several person would deem `` that lady in ermine '' to be outdated and stuffy .
but it is a fairy tale ,
and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow .
my suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork 
the costume 
the witty script and everything else this film has to offer ,
and stop complaining .
the film has been released on dvd in germany 
with both german and english soundtrack .
