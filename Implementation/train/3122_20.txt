i saw this movie year ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festival ,
where we would set out
to rent a bunch of b-movie and vote
for who picked the worst.the night
we watched this ,
it was voted the best ,
due to semblance of plot and fun costuming.this is certainly a silly 
kitschy 
movie ,
to be watched under the full understanding
that you are watching low-budget fluff .
personally 
however 
i would not recommend additional substance ...
this movie will leave
it is own mark on you.it made enough of an impression on me
that i have actually been trying to get my hand on a copy for a few year.a good choice
if you are setting out to watch bad movie .
this one is fun ,
and i remember bouncy music ...
