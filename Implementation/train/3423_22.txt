`` the godfather '' 
`` citizen kane '' 
`` star war '' 
`` goodfellas '' none of the above compare to the complex illiance of `` the sopranos '' .
each and every character has layer upon layer of absolute verity 
completely and utterly three dimensional .
we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly ,
despite the fact
that in the simplest model of good vs. evil ,
he is evil .
soprano is the most provocative 
intricate ,
and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history .
if you are in the mood
to be overtly challenged as a viewer ,
and to be forever altered on your feeling toward entertainment 
watch `` the sopranos '' .
i defy anybody to sit down
and watch the very first episode of season 1 ,
and not want to continue with the series .
each season is completely illiant in its own way .
dvds are essential to anybody 's collection **** of out 4
