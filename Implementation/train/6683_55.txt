murder by number is one of those movie
that
you expect is made-for-tv
but is not .
considering the only actor of any note is bullock
( although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better thing ) ,
it is not a great surprise
that this movie quickly fades away from memory
to be replaced by more important thing .
like ... remembering to lock your front door
when you go out .
or putting clothe back on when you come out of the shower.bullock plays cassie mayweather 
a cop with personal issue
( do not they all ) .
together with her new partner
( a wet-looking ben chaplin ) ,
she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman .
nothing unusual there
except that the perps are a couple of teenage student
who think
they have planned
and executed the perfect murder .
as the investigation continues 
a battle of will emerge between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood
( ryan gosling )
.the crippling issue here is that the two lead are hopeless .
bullock ,
though she is very nice to look at ,
is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield
( actually ,
he had be better ! ) .
chaplin 
for his sin 
is a complete non-entity and i feel sorry
that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to eak into hollywood .
at least gosling and pitt 
as the conniving sneering suspect 
acquit themselves adequately .
as if dodgy lead were not bad enough 
a story
that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable
( but illogical )
ending shoot this film in the head
before it has a chance to run .
`` murder by number '' has absolutely nothing going for it ,
even a pointless nude scene by bullock would not redeem it .
well 
just a little but still not enough to save it .
forgettable 
predictable and redundant - this is one film
that is not going to move the cop genre forward .
as cassie probably says on her next case ,
there is nothing to see here person .
move along ,
keep moving ...
