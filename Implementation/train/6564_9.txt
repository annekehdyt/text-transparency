the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow 's during world war ii .
it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor 
especially the line
expressed by the acid-tongue leo genn .
anthony steele and david tomlinson
( later george bank in mary poppin )
are marvelous as the two hero .
the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout .
highly recommended .
