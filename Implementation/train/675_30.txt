i got this one a few week ago
and love it !
it is modern ,
light but filled with true complexity of life .
it question and answer 
just like other eytan fox movie .
this is my favorite 
along with jossi and jagger .
this pictures a lot more 
universally ,
than only the bubble we may live in .
you do not need to be jewish or homosexual
to enjoy this - i am not ,
but the movie goes directly to my top ten movie .
at first it seems like pure entertainment
but it does make you think further .
relationship we have to live with are superficial 
meaningful 
deep 
fatal ,
you name it .
you do not know what is coming ,
and you definitely do not know
where this story is heading
as you watch it the first time .
it is worth seeing several time .
fox movie include great bonus material - here a great music video and `` the making of ''
( including explanation of the title 
interviewing lior ashknenazi
who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubt about the israeli life style ) .
