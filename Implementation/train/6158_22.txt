oh my god !
please 
for the love of all
that is holy ,
do not watch this movie !
it it 82 minute of my life i will never get back .
sure 
i could have stopped watching half way through .
but i thought
it might get better .
it did not .
anyone
who actually enjoyed this movie
is one seriously sick and twisted individual .
no wonder us australians/new zealander have a terrible reputation
when it comes to making movie .
everything about this movie is horrible 
from the acting to the editing .
i do not even normally write review on here ,
but in this case i will make an exception .
i only wish someone had of warned me
before i hired this catastrophe
