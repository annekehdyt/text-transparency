a typical clausen film ,
but then again not typical .
clausen write 
direct and play one of the leading role .
this is really a great film about normal person
living normal life
trying to make the best of it .
the 4 primary actor were fantastic.fritz helmut was convincing .
you believe
that he really is sick.sonja richter plays a nurse
that really is an actor ,
but it turns out
that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man.everybody has problem and those
who nobody believes in ends up being happy .
but nothing good comes easy ,
they have to fight to win their life and love .
