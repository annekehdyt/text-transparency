well no 
i tell a lie ,
this is in fact not the best movie of all time ,
but it is a really enjoyable movie
that
nobody
i know
has seen.it is a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat morita
( mr miyagi )
with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something ,
but that does not matter .
the reason
this movie is fun
is because of the interaction between the two lead ,
who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friend .
the whole culture difference thing is done quite well ,
in that it is fun to watch ,
it is completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way .
the soundtrack is cool ,
once again in a cheesy 80 's kind of way ,
it suit the movie ,
i have been trying to find one of the song for age ,
but as i am working from memory of what i think
a few of the word were i can not seem to find it.another thing
this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever ,
but i will not give that one away 
oh no !
in conclusion i would take this movie over 48 hours\\most of eddie murphy output
including beverly hill cop ,
and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their name .
if you are looking for a buddy cop movie
and are getting fed up with `` straight white cop meet zany streetwise black cop ''
give this a shot .
you might be pleasantly
surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with `` straight japanese cop meet zany streetwise white cop '' .i
am
giving this 7. to be honest i like it more than that .
i would rather watch this
than a lot of stuff i would give 8.
but i guess i know deep down
that it is some sort of insanity
that makes me like this movie .
