first let me say
that i am not a duke fan ,
but after this movie the series looked like law and order .
the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg .
burt reynold is not boss hogg ,
and even worse was m.c .
gainey as roscoe ,
if they ever watched
the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop .
he was more a barney fife than the role
he played in this movie.the movie
is loaded with the usual error ,
car getting torn up ,
and continues like nothing happened .
the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett ,
and the general is ran into a dirt hill
obviously slowing to a near stop ,
but goes on to win the race .
