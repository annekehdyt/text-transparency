one of the best `` amitabh comeback '' movie i liked .
this was the phase
when govinda was going strong with dhawan .
the song were awesome and totally
as we call it `` masti '' type .
an evergreen entertainer with the like of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in .
the story line has a lot of hilarious twist and turn
as is known for david dhawan 's potboiler .
with a timely appearance by mrs.madhuri `` nene '' dixit ,
it was a total riot towards the end .
it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile .
although some may consider it a typical `` bollywood masala '' movie ,
i would watch it any day .
i am giving
it an easy 8/10 just for being pure bollywood .
