when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas ,
its title did not sound familiar to me
since i have not read the novel
and had not heard anything about the film .
yet ,
having read the content ,
i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie .
the effect surprised me totally :
i do not remember
when i last saw a film
in which every single moment
involved me .
a vow to cherish is ,
without any doubt 
one of the movie
that now constitutes a real surprise i
have received from cinema .
here are some argument of mine
why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .
first 
the entire content is particularly educational .
it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answer for the universal question .
is there a need for christ in our time ?
does love still matter ?
what for is there faith ?
what is the logic of burden
and suffering in life ?
is there really someone by my side i can always trust ?
the movie provides the answer through the content since all
that happens to the character may
as well happen to any of us.second ,
the movie is exceptionally humane .
the main character experience inner struggle and cope with extremely hard decision .
is it better for kyle david denman )
and teri
( megan paul )
to start their own life
and forget about the family or retain the value
they were taught at home ?
is it better for john
( ken howard )
to leave ellen
( barbara babcock ) ,
his sick wife ,
and start a new happy life with julia
( donna bullock ) ,
a woman
he falls in love with ?
in fact 
ellen no longer recognizes him ... yet ,
he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity .
had john 's rebellious other 
phil
( d. david morin ) ,
better go on his easy life
although it does not ing him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life .
phil 's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity .
these word could be as well said by everybody no matter of where ,
when or how they live.third ,
the movie is a great portrayal of family 
not very popular nowaday :
there are problem 
yet ,
there is always something more powerful
that gets these person together .
this `` something '' is love and trust .
i know
that it may seem a bit idealistic .
not all family can rely on fidelity
and it may not be as simple as that .
nevertheless 
it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one.fourth 
the entire film focuses on person 's mutual help .
if we want to live happy life in our society ,
we must understand one thing :
we have to help one another .
alexander
( ossie davis )
is an example of such attitude .
at the beginning of the movie 
we see him talk to john about praying .
later 
he helps his other .
alexander is a kinda `` angel ''
that is sent to john and his family .
is not it possible
that we may become angel to one another ? fifth ,
the artistic feature are also worth attention .
performance :
barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen
and although she has a difficult role ,
she does a perfect job .
consider 
for instance 
the moment she appears at school
and badly wants to teach again .
ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband .
picture :
the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaf
( autumn )
while the sunshine
( love )
spreads everywhere .
i interpreted as a sort of symbol :
even if there is sorrow ,
this can always be illuminated by light and joy ... a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie
that realistically showed to me what it means to love ,
what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe .
at the end 
i would like to quote the profound word from the movie i found very touching
and hope
you will also do kyle to his uncle phil :
yes 
he
( john brighton )
life according to the bible .
but nobody force you to do so .
yet ,
according to what rule do you live ?
