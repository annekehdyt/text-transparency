this movie deserves more than a 1. but i am
giving it a one
because so many fricken fan boy have given it a 10 resulting
in it getting a rating
that 'll take it into the top 100 list .
seriously it is not that great its not that bad .
its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boy
it is ridiculous .
these are the type
who probably still laugh at chuck norris joke
and still say
`` i am rick jame b ! tch '' no matter
how old or annoying it gets .
i dread
having to hear `` i
am tired of mfn snake on this mfn plane '' month from now from idiot
trying to be funny .
its crappy plot crap acting etc .
its okay to love a bad movie ,
but you still got ta admit its a bad movie.wait for the marine starring john cena
if you wan na see a real movie
