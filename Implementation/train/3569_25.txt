wow !
this film is the best living testament ,
i think ,
of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc ,
compared to anything
shown by the major medium outlet.those outlet
can only show you what happened on the outside .
this film shows you what happened on the inside .
it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman ,
waiting for week for the first big fire
that he will be called to fight .
the subject matter turns auptly with the only existing footage of the first plane
to hit the tower .
you are then given a front-row seat as firefighter rush to the scene 
into the lobby of tower one .
in the minute
that precede the crash of the second plane ,
and tower two 's subsequent fall ,
you see fireman reacting to the unsettling sound of person landing above the lobby .
it is a sight
you will not soon forget.heart-rending 
tear-jerking 
and very compelling from the first minute to the last 
`` 9/11 '' deserve to go down in history
as one of the best documentary film ever made.we must never forget .
