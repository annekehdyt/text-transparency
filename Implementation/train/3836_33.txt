i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 year ago ,
and blasted it .
i believe
i called it `` wretched '' and a `` turkey . ''
okay 
well 
by most standard 
it is still a turkey .
it is got almost no production value ,
what little plot there is makes almost no sense ,
and the acting is on the level of a third-grade play .
that said ,
this has really grown on me over the year as a sort of camp classic .
in fact 
all of director todd sheet ' film have had this effect .
they are almost like ed wood in that regard :
watch them over and over
and pick out the flubbed line 
continuity error
( same zombie 
two different location !
) ,
and other flaws.i will say this :
sheet is a very nice guy ,
and
while this 
one of his first production ,
is not that great ,
he has gotten better .
and i must add
that the only really decent actor/actress in the film is kasey rousch ,
though i may be biased ,
as i attended school with her .
