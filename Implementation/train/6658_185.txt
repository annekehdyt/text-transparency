this film sat on my tivo for week
before i watched it .
i dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationship gone bad .
i was wrong ;
this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed-up libidos of new yorkers.the format is the same as max ophuls ' `` la ronde 
''
based on a play by arthur schnitzler ,
who is given an `` inspired by '' credit .
it starts from one person 
a prostitute ,
standing on a street corner in brooklyn .
she is picked up by a home contractor ,
who has sex with her on the hood of a car ,
but can not come .
he refuses to pay her .
when he is off peeing ,
she answers his cell phone
and takes a message .
she runs away with his keys.then the story switch to the contractor ,
who pays a professional call on a rich ,
bored new york woman ,

they make out ,
and robert goes down on martin.next we follow martin ,

but is a good audience for nick ,
who needs a sympathetic ear .
the two of them go to coney island at night ,
and look at the star .
nick fall under joey 's spell ,
despite the age difference between them .
they go back to joey 's apartmant ,
and nick gradually realizes
that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman .

since she played latke 's wife in taxi . )
joey 's phone ring ,
and it is a man
calling the psychic friend network ,
and joey is one of the psychic friend .
although she is still hurting from nick ,
she gradually gets into her psychic shtick .

that the man is going to commit suicide ,
and she try to make him believe
that she is his friend ,
that she cares about him .
and she does care about him.but the man packs a gun into his iefcase ,
and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront ,
and we come back to the beginning 
to the same prostitute
who started out la ronde .
she wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash
if she will kill him .
he tried to kill himself ,
but could not do it .
the prostitute does not want to do it ,
but he insists ,
holding her hand ,
holding the gun inside his mouth ,
telling her where to aim .
eventually 
the gun goes off ,
and we see the prostitute walking down the street 
and arriving at the corner
where she normally does business .

who did not pay her earlier in the movie drives up 
rolls down the window .
they look at each other .
