caught this movie on the tube on a sunday .
i thought
it was so bad i looked it up on imdb
to see what other thought of it .
i was not surprised at the amount of silly person
who enjoyed this fluff .
i was however surprised
when i looked into the comment
to read the hated
it categories
only to find
that their were none .
i was shocked at this ;
i always look at the hated
it is as their are always those
who hate a movie no matter how good it is .
somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the hater i say nay to that and proclaim proudly
that i hate this movie !
i know
i should go into detail about why i hate this movie
but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves .
