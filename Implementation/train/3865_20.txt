if this book remained faithful to the book then
we can only assume
that the author was ignorant of history .
mark anthony never died of injury
obtained in battle as depicted .
he died a coward 's death
by committing suicide and even then ,
he asked his slave to do it for him .
the slave chose to kill himself instead .
in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the slave 's great valor
and decided to copy him .
but even in death mark anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt .
he cried out for cleopatra
and was taken to her 
bleeding .
she hauled his litter up on rope and mark anthony died a while later .
if you want history do not watch this movie .
if you want romantic drivel
then you will
probably enjoy it !
