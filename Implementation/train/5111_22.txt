a reasonable effort is summary for this film .
a good sixty film but lacking any sense of achievement .
maggie smith gave a decent performance
which was believable enough but not as good
as she could have given ,
other actor were just dreadful !
a terrible portrayal .
it was not very funny
and so it did not really achieve its genre
as it was not particularly funny
and it was not dramatic .
the only genre
achieved to a satisfactory level
was romance .
target audience were not hit
and the movie sent out confusing message .
a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well
and person were left confused
as to why the film was not as good
and who the target audience were etc .
however maggie was quite good
and the storyline was alright with moment of capability.4 .
