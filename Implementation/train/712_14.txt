whoever wrote up `` redline ''
as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek
to promote this ultra crappy flaming 
steaming pile of amateur crap .
easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made .
this makes showgirls look like citizen kane.take every cheesy clich\u00e9 out of an 80s action tv series ,
put in some really crappy special effect and lame character with no relevance
and you have living proof
that daniel sadek should not write screenplay and produce movie
but should remain in the real estate business.this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequence ever .
what offends me is not that the maker of this film are idiot
but that they consider
the movie going public to be idiot enough
to fall for this crap .
