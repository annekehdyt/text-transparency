i saw this film in my cinema class .
i am glad
that i did not pay to see it .
i came into it with an open mind ,
and was even a little excited .
i really enjoy ed norton and evan rachel wood ,
and the rest of the cast was interesting .
i just never connected with this movie .
the acting was great ,
the cinematography was interesting ,
but the storyline 
or rather 
lack thereof 
was a problem .
there was no central 
connecting theme to the movie .
was it a romance between norton and wood ?
well 
no 
not really .
was it a western ?
kind of 
but no .
i am all for twist in movie ,
i recently saw `` brick ''
and loved it ,
but the place
that this movie went was just too out there .
it was so weird ,
and if i were not required
to have sat through the whole film ,
i would have walked out .
the writing was not terrible ,
but it was just all over the place .
by the time this movie ended ,
i was just left terribly confused and wishing
that it had ended sooner .
there was just something about this film
that did not resonate ,
i understand more offbeat film like `` fight club '' ,
but i just did not care about the character at all .
