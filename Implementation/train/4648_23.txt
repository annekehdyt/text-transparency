i started to watch this movie with high expectation .
however 
after one hour i gave up on this movie
as it only instilled lot of unanswered question upon me .
this already started in the opening sequence
and only got worse.why would they bury the hollander under a statue ?
why is there an italian comediant present ?
why did the farmer wife save the hollander ?
why did he ,
upon being saved ,
not run for his life instead of starting
to make love to the farmer wife ?
why did the farmer wife not save the hollander at a time
when the farmer would not be around ?
why did these presumably illiterate farmer understand italian ?
why did the italian comediant know about the hollander gold ?
why did
he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmer property ?
these and many more question popped up 
and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way .
so i guess
i am totally missing the point of this movie ,
and i am not connecting to the story in any way ... .
