for those of you
who are not aware with the theme
that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his film
-- the western assault on traditional serbian value --
it will be impossible for you to understand his narrative .
this continuous theme ,
expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle ,
is one
that kusturica has elected to mandate .
since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground ' 
kusturica 's film ' 'black cat white cat ' 
'life is a miracle ' ,
and recently with 'promise me this ' 
his slapstick 
carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization ' of balkan culture 
its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom .
in the case of 'promise me this ' 
the paradoxical world of city
( urban space )
and village
( traditional idiom )
space are contrasted .
the world of the city reflects western attribute
that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ;
organized crime 
sexual exploitation 
a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional value
-- as expressed toward the young kid --
villager .
the end of the film further exemplify this notion
as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road .
they are on a collision coarse ;
appropriately 
the wedding ,
which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village 
i.e .
traditional value 
are about to collide with the funeral mourner 
exemplifying the death of tradition within this context .
yet kusturica illiantly examines this theme through his own unique 
stylistic singularity .
with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .
