yeah 
it is a chick flick
and it moves kinda slow ,
but it is actually pretty good - and i consider myself a manly man .
you got ta love judy davis ,
no matter what she is in ,
and the girl
who plays her daughter gives a natural 
convincing performance.the scenery of the small 
coastal summer spot
is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie .
the unknown
( at least unknown to me )
actor and actress lend a realism to the movie
that draws you in
and keeps your attention .
overall 
i give it an 8/10 .
go see it .
