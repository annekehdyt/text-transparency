since starting to read the book this movie
is based on 
i am
having mixed feeling about the filmed result .
i learned some time ago
to see the movie adaptation of a book
before i read the book ,
because i found
that
if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film .
this would undoubtedly have been true here 
wherea in the case of atonement ,
which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i
have ever seen ,
it would probably not have mattered.i am trying to figure out what the cause is ,
and i suspect
that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham .
much as i respect him for the hour
( which i have not read
but which i saw
and was awed by )
i can not escape the feeling
that he not so much adapted susan minton 's book
as he did take a few of the character and the basic premise
and write his own movie out of it.it is not that i dislike the movie .
i actually love the movie ,
which is why ,
since i started reading the novel ,
i am feeling disturbed about the whole thing .
i feel disloyal to ms. minton
for enjoying the movie
which was so thooughly a departure from her work .
reading it ,
i can understand
why she had such a struggle adapting it .
unlike what one reviewer of the movie said ,
it is not so much
that some novel do not deserve to be a movie ;
it is more like some book
just can not make the transition .
ms. minton 's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character 
so internally ,
that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm .
even though a lot of the book is memory of real event ,
it is memory ,
and so fragmented and ethereal as to be 
i feel 
not filmable .
i think
that ms. minton 's work is a real work of literature ,
but can not make the transition to film ,
which in no way detracts from its value.i can not yet report
that evening 
the film 
does not represent evening 
the novel 
in any more than the most superficial way 
since i am only halfway through ,
but the original would have to make a tremendous leap
to resemble the film
that follows at this point .
i guess i am writing this
because i feel
that
if you are going to adapt a novel 
adapt it ,
but do not make it something else
that it is not .
i am not sure
if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original ,
but from what i can see so far the thing
he has done
are all based
on someone else 's work .
we would not have the hour if virginia woolf had not written mrs. dalloway ,
and we would not have evening ,
in its distressed form 
if susan minton had not had so much trouble
doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place .
but it is too much to say
that it would be better
if ms. minton had left well enough alone ,
because evening 
the film 
is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.thus my confusion 
mixed feeling 
sense of disloyalty 
and ultimate conclusion
that 
in this case 
the novel can not be the film and vice versa 
and my eventual gratitude to both writer
for doing what they did ,
so that we have both work
as they are .
