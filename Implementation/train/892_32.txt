this was one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
i am still not sure
if it was serious 
or just a satire .
one of those movie
that uses every stupid
who dunnit clich\u00e9
they can think of .
arrrrgh.don johnson was pretty good in it actually .
but otherwise it sucked .
it was over 10 year ago
that i saw it ,
but it still hurts
and will not stop lingering in my ain .
the last line in the movie really sums up
how stupid it is .
i will not ruin it for you ,
should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie .
but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end 
with a few in between .
if you have nothing better to do ,
and you like to point and laugh ,
then maybe it might be worth your while .
additionally 
if you are forced to go on a date with someone
you really do not like ,
suggest watching this movie together ,
and they will probably leave you alone
after they see it .
that is a fair price to pay ,
i guess .
