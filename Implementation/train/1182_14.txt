this film has been scaring me
since the first day i saw it.my mum had watched it
when it was on the telly back in '92 .
i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful rambling
as my dad helped her up
the stairs.she was saying
something like `` do not let her get me '' or something like that .
i asked what had made her so upset
and she told me
that she had been watching the woman in black.so obviously i
had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me .
it scared the s*** out of me .
i have been immune to horror film
since watching this !
