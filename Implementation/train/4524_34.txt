culled from the real life exploit of chuck connor and steve brodie in 1890s new york ,
`` the bowery '' is high energy
and good natured.but be warned :
casual racial epithet flow off the tongue of wallace beery and little jackie cooper .
the very first shot might be startling .
this is true to the time
it was set and the time it was made .
and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the wood .
it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere.beery
as connor is the blustering thunder at the center of the action 
a loud-mouth saloon keeper with his own fire igade .
and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper .
raft as brodie is connor ' slicker ,
better looking rival in almost every endeavor .
brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention ,
leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge
( it is still debated
whether he actually jumped or used a dummy )
.beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on irish-american accent .
he is just the gruff sort of character
to draw child 
cat and lady in distress .
this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played ,
and he even gets to throw in a little dancing
( as well as a show of leg ) .
and again he mistakes the leading lady
( lovely fay wray )
for a prostitute .
cooper is as tough as either of them ,
though he gets a chance
to turn on the tears.the highlight
is not the jump off the idge but a no-holds-barred fistfight between connor and brodie
that in closeup look like a real awl between the principal .
it is sure someone uised more than an ego .
