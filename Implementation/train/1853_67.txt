really .
does any week go by that oprah does not remind us
that she was abused as child ?
she makes herself the focus of every interview.oprah can not resist commanting on the answer to every question
she asks .
she often interrupts guest
before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote .
director are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest 's faces
because that is what counts - what oprah feel ,
what oprah says.oprah 
oprah 
oprah .
it is always all about oprah.oprah says
- feel sorry for me ,
i was so poor .
feel the pain of my battle with my weight .
feel my hurt
when i am turned away from a fancy store after
they have already closed .
feel good
for buying my magazine and book .
feel good for my success .
feel good
when you give to my charity
to make me look good .
feel good
for making me rich beyond belief.my interpretation of her point of view :
you viewer are all deeply flawed
and you need my daily advice .
i have all the answer for your life
though i have nothing in common with you plebes .
i have never been married nor do i want to be .
i have never had to raise a family -
but i know all about it .
i have little respect for man or marriage .
i clearly prefer person like me over other - witness `` legends ball 2006 '' .
gayle is my best friend
but we are not gay.a of 7/31/2006 
the heading on her website actually reads :
`` oprah.com is your leading source for information about love 
life 
self 
relationship 
food 
home 
spirit and health . ''
how presumptive and obnoxious is that ?
in june 2006 
she crashed two private wedding reception in oklahoma to gather footage for her september 2006 show .
she keeps promising to quit tv but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight.contrary
to what she thinks ,
oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from god .
she is just one very lucky 
overweight 
black woman
who copied phil donahue 's style
and called it her own .
she happened to be in the right place at the right time
and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic .
oprah is the p.t .
barnum of this age
and it amazes me
that person can not see through her facade .
so lady and gentleman 
boy and girl and you too oprah
if you can fit
that inflated ego through the door - this way now to the great egress ...
