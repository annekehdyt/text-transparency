i enjoy watching western film
but this movie takes the biscuit .
the script and dialogue is laughable .
the acting was awful ,
where did they get them from ?
music was ok i have to say .
luckily i did not buy or rent the movie
but its now disposed of.i was geared up at the beginning
when the stranger
( martin sheen )
started to tell his story .
i have to admit
i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex
where hopalong shot tex 's finger off
and told him to practise for 40 year
to reach his league .
but that where it all went pear shaped thereafter .
i had to watch the whole film in the hope
that it would get better ,
never did .
