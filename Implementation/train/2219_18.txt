having not seen this film in about 20 year i am still impressed with it 's hard -hitting impact and stellar acting .
of course 
one mr. mickey rooney is indeed ,
incredible in his role as the ring-leading `` killer '' .
( in reference to another review here-none other than orson welle evoked mickey rooney 's name as the greatest movie actor 
also . )
i also recall the jazzy-assy score and the bare black and white photography .
i love the mick 's last line
before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning .
( i think
the strangler lifted it for a line in one of their songs-get a grip on yourself .
) this is a great film
and unjustly buried film .
let 's get it out !
side note-a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segal 's `` babyface nelson '' ,
made a couple year before `` last mile ''
and also starring mickey rooney .
another rave of the mick 's intense and sympathetic performance.perhap it is the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performance .
