granted 
this seems like a good idea .
steve martin 
goldie hawn 
and john cleese in a neil simon comedy .
where can you go wrong ?
watch the movie ,
and you will find out.in truth 
martin 
the lead 
is mis-cast .
he is not doing the great slapstick
he is known for 
from movie like `` the jerk '' ,
but instead plays a sort of in-between character
that does not work .
hawn 
with no one to play off of ,
is terrible .
cleese is the only even partially funny member.to top it off ,
the plot is pretty stupid .
i can not say
how much of it may have been changed ,
but the character seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense .
they blunder through new york ,
not doing anything right ,
and unfortuneatly 
nothing funny .
not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable ,
it seems to give the message
that person
who do not live in new york
are not very ight 
a theme repeated throughout the movie.in summation ,
instead of seeing this ,
go rent the original `` odd couple '' again .
