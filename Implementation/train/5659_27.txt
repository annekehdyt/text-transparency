while the original titillates the intellect ,
this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibility .
instead of intricate plot-twist ,
this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story change
that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development .
worst of all ,
replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter word ,
leaving behind a stark ,
but uninteresting taste.there was promise
-- unfulfilled promise .
the prospect of michael caine
pulling off a patty duke-like keller-to-sullivan graduation
is admittedly intriguing .
unfortunately 
this illiant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation ,
first
by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense
and then by turning in a performance
that only looks competent
when compared to jude law 's amateurish overacting.if
you have not seen the classic original 
overlook its dated visual and gimmick .
hunt it down 
watch it ,
and just enjoy a story-and-a-half .
as for the remake 
pass on this insult to the original .
