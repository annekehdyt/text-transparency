... .after 16 year tim burton finally disappoints me ! ! ! !
whatever happened to the old burton
who read `` the dark knight return '' by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988-89 ?
by the look of it burton did not research the book nor the movie cause
he got everything wrong !
this movie sucks !
it is not as good as the original
and it does not deal with the same subject as the original .
if you want a good ape movie watch the original .
