though this may not necessarily be a so-called `` classic '' film by today 's standard ,
it is still worth seeing .
the main reason
why is
because after experiencing this film ,
you get the feeling
that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60 's ,
no matter however good or bad.i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo ,
and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60 's icon ,
the film is far from being simply `` thrown together '' .my point is that
if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused ,
the film has done
it is job :
it is conveyed a desolate view of the future
that leaves you feeling unsure and angry .
it was perhaps this same feeling
that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified.as such ,
`` zaiskie point '' may not tell a very good
( or interesting )
story ,
and at the same time its character may be one-sided and predictable .
however 
it also conveys so well this sort of clich\u00e9d 
rebellious desire
to get out of the existence
which both mark and daria must share .
even the anti-establishment student are as inauthentic
as the gov't they rebel against .
