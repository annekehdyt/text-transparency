there are too many new style of the sitcom but the one
that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set .
that 70 's show is a great example .
when the show came on the air ,
nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and dea jo rupp much less the adolescent
played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton
( both of them are leaving the show this year
to pursue other interest )
i wish topher would stay around
because the show began about his character 
eric 
and his close circle of friend .
ashton is already the john travolta of our time .
remember
when john was in love with diana hyland from eight
is enough ,
think of ashton with demi moore .
the cast of actor were never known to us
which is a good thing
because a celeity cast member can spoil it .
i miss mo gaffney
who played don 's girlfriend joanne .
i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie ,
the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that .
i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted
but beloved father figure to steven hyde .
i loved watching tanya robert besides charlie 's angel .
i loved brooke shield
playing jackie 's mom .
she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway .
this show has been a delight with many surprise .
i hope this show lasts longer
even though 2 of their cast member are leaving
but i hope
they do not stay too far away too long .
i wish the show 's creator 
bonnie and terry turner ,
who also created my other favorite show 
third rock from the sun ,
is more successful on fox
than they were on nbc
which sabotaged their show .
the turner are not dummy
and i hope
they create more show like this in the future .
