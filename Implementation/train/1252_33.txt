steve carpenter can not make horror movie .
first of all 
the casting was very wrong for this movie .
the only decent part was the hot own haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer .
this movie has no gore
( usually a key ingredient to a horror movie ) ,
no action 
no acting 
and no suspense
( also a key ingredient ) .
wes bentley is a good actor
but he is so dry and plain in this
that it is sad .
there were a few part
that were supposed to be funny
( continuing the teen horror/comedy movie )
and no one laughed in the audience .
i thought
that this movie was rated r ,
and i did not pay attention
and realized
it had been changed to pg-13 .
anyway 
see this movie
if you liked i
still know
what you did last summer .
that is the only type of person
who would find this movie even remotely scary .
and seriously 
this is to you steve carpenter ,
stop making horror movie .
this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre .
