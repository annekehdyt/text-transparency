american pie :
beta house is sort of in limbo between genre .
on the one hand 
it is a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever joke .
on the other hand 
it is porno that is a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewer .
essentially beta house is a collage of sex scene
- some humiliating ,
other just lame attempt at humor - with a couple thin plot point
thrown in an effort at cohesiveness .
the character are barely even two-dimensional 
most development rely on knowledge of naked mile ,
and the `` important '' plot scene are so far apart
that you wonder
why the writer even felt the need for a story.in all fairness ,
i did not go into this movie
without expectation .
i liked the original three american pie movie ,
and thought
band camp and naked mile were solid rental .
i thought
naked mile was almost good enough
to be released in theater ,
and so
when i saw
that some of the same character were returning for beta house ,
i was excited to see this installment .
i was aware
that there would be numerous scene of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple form .
and i was fine with it ,
because in the past 
these scene were backed by the story
and were well integrated into the plot .
in beta house 
however 
it is almost as if the writer forgot
why the formula in the other ap movie worked .
they spent too much energy working in the nudity
that they forgot to actually write
a story.this movie
is a disappointment
and not even worth a one-dollar rental .
the joke are lame ,
the story is non-existent ,
and the porno-aspect is too tame
if that is all you really care about seeing .
