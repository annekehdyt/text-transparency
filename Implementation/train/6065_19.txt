not totally off the wall in a good way ,
but just totally stupid .
`` killer tongue '' is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi 
horror 
and supposed comedy .
what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film .
there is very little dialog 
mainly due to the fact
that the script ,
if there was one ,
is complete `` pond scum '' .
i would not even call it strange 
more like just `` total nonsense '' .
this movie is certain to disappoint ,
and you have been warned .
there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this ,
and
if you do ,
the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... merk
