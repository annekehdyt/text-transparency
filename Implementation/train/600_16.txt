the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure
if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie .
a blend of the two genre just does not work
and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere .
this is more so
as the director has picked the most extreme of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life
making it an unconvincing documentary .
if it is meant to be a thriller/drama this
is too dull and monotonous .
in either case 
what is the moral or the message
which the director is trying to convey to the audience ?
that around us there are person
who ill-treat other who are willing to be ill-treated ?
that there are many crazy lunatic around us ?
so ... ... ... .so what ?
