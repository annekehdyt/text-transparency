shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress
that accepted a role .
elizabeth shue is a commendable actress ,
why would she emace such an overrated opportunity ?
i must give credit
where credit is due 
though .
some moment in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing ,
but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendency of kevin bacon 's character 
sebastian caine .
i would not recommend this movie to anyone 
man or woman ,
that has any form of self-respect to account for .
