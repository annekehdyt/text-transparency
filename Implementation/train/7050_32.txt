this film is `` riveting ''
but in much the same way a car crash is riveting .
it is hard to look away .
overall 
this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment
-- and a futile 
biased experiment at that .
the filmmaker are manipulative
and seem to have no problem going for the lowest possible denominator .
the manner
in which the money is presented to ted
is pure exploitation .
the intervening step
that the filmmaker force ted to participate in ( meeting with so-called expert )
were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with ted .
instead 
it is painfully obvious
that they serve to cover the filmmaker 's posterior
and to further exploit ted 's situation .
the worst part is that the filmmaker stop
following ted after 6 month ;
and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject
they had followed so closely month before .
if they had cared ,
they would have found better `` expert ''
to help ted .
if they truly wanted to see what ted would do ,
then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention .
this film is at best a high-ow jackass stunt and not a documentary .
it is sad to think
how much $ 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person 's life had
it been put in the right hand .
