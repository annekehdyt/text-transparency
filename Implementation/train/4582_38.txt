there are many polouse dramas doing the round .
i am not sure why .
it is probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.this film has a documentary style
as we follow the difficult initiation of anne 
a raw recruit 
into a polouse squad stationed in the baltic area .
no attempt is made to glamorise the polouse .
they are truly down to earth 
harsh at time and unforgiving 
anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition .
against all rule
she sometime holds back incriminating information
found on her strip search and other investigations.this is not a pleasant film .
not one to relax you .
there is not much feeling of optimism in it .
the polouse seem to be involved in a losing battle .
tomorrow there will be more bashing 
more murder 
more family eak-up 
and more distressed child .
let 's face it .
this is the world
we live in.as day go by anne become more intimately
involved with the polouse and with the family
they are investigating .
the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny 
a 12 year old from a oken family .
anne has her own way of patching thing up .
she turns a blind eye to benny 's shoplifting
and try to help him as best she can .
i was surprised
though that she went so far as to seduce benny 's father .
it set me wondering
if it was in consideration of the father or her own need .
after all 
the film makes it clear
that she was desperately in need of a partner
and loving child.well cast but not my idea of an evening 's entertainment ,
