does anyone think
that this show actually helps some person ,
or does it only anger the person
who watch it ?
when i am flipping through the channel
and come upon this show i half
to watch out of morbid curiosity .
i understand
that pat roberson is not all together .
what i do not know is if his viewer are like him or if
they are good person
and think they will have a better life if
they
listening to what he has to say .
pat roberson is of little consequence .
he is an old man
who thinks in an old way .
fear of damnation no longer has the same affects
as it once did
( thank god ) .
now if someone will please answer
my question i will be dodging lightning bolt for the rest of eternity .
