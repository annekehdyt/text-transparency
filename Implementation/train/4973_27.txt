i have always been enthusiastic about period dramas 
an art form
in which the bbc has excelled in the past .
this presentation of `` byron '' was unbelievable .
unbelievably bad !
the script was dreadful 
the acting uninspired 
and all the character woefully insipid .
apparently byron was `` mad bad and dangerous to know '' ,
and set the lady hearts all-a-flutter .
not in this production .
here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence .
it is said
that byron walked with a limp .
this portrayal of the man was just limp all over.i watched the whole two and a half hour waiting for something
to spark into life .
not a splutter ,
not even a glimmer .
it was utter tedium 
if not downright boredom 
from start to finish.having the opinion
that no-one will ever better the bard of avon ,
i also believe
that byron 's poetry is over-revered
and to my mind should be flung on the back burner ,
and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment.i think
the bbc lost its nous with this one
