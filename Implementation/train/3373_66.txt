the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattail of the 60's-created concept
that comic book
could only be done as `` camp ''
( i.e. 
the 60 's batman show )
for tv and movie .
thus you have combat sequence with subtitle
( come on !
) 
a cluelessly unromantic doc savage
( he was uncomfortable around woman in the pulps 
not an idiot ) ,
monk mayfair in a nightheet
( a scene guaranteed
to give you nightmare for several night ) ,
and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez
posing for an oscar statute .
and when they are not doing booming sousa march score ,
the tinkly little `` funny '' music undercuts much of the drama.even as such 
this movie is ... okay .
it is fun ,
and
when it stays serious
it is a very accurate representation of the pulps .
except for monk ,
as has been mentioned before :
he is hugely muscled 
not obese .
and long tom ,
who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude 
not paul gleason with an ( inexplicable )
scarf.the green death sequence 
for instance 
are remarkably gruesome
and not something
i would recommend for child .
but they are very close to the feel of the pulps .
when the writer and producer get it right ,
they do get it right - i will give them that.but
if the producer had done doc with the loving care and scripting of 
say 
reeve ' first two superman movie ,
think
what we might have had then .
i think
the problem is the movie 's schizophrenic .
there is a definite sense
of trying to do a 30 's homage ,
but they are also trying to give in to the `` hero must be camp '' attitude
that batman created .
one gets the impression there was a sober 
pulp-style first draft
and then someone came in
and said 
`` hey 
let 's make it funny -
it worked with the batman show 8 year ago !
`` but doc life on 
thank to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai .
if macrauch are not doing a homage to doc savage in that movie ,
the man is truly demented .
so when the series actually gets on tv
( allegedly mid-season in '99-00 ) ,
doc savage 
updated to the 90 's 
will live once more .
