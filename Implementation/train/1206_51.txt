hunter chase what they think
is a man through the forest ,
though the audience sees he is a werewolf .
the hunter never seem to realize this ,
because
after they shoot him ,
he looks normal
when they decapitate him.a doctor transplants the werewolf 's eye into a man
who lost his own in a laboratory experiment .
the man 
rich 
gets to have sex with his nurse
( stephanie beaton )
before he even gets his bandage removed.after
he leaves the hospital ,
he finds
his wife has been cheating on him too .
when a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon
( with a fake tree anch on the foreground ) ,
he turns into a werewolf !
his torso grow larger 
splitting his shirt ,
and he grow a giant werewolf mask on his head
that has red light in the eye .
his pant stay intact .
the mouth chews unconvincingly ,
though some sort of robotic
( or hidden hand )
in the eyeow give him a baleful look at times.despite the poor werewolf costume ,
there is a fair amount of blood and gore ,
and those are fairly well done .
there is even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie .
however ,
when a man falls from a height ,
a rather bad dummy does the job.rich has a friend named siodmak
who is some sort of occult expert ,
and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutch named androse
who is also such an expert .
they try to help him a little.rich kill person
who have done him wrong .
a policewoman investigates the murder and try to hit on beaton ,
who does not much care for lesbian scene
so nothing comes of it.quite cheap 
but between the nudity and blood and gore 
and a not-terrible story combining
( sort of )
the most dangerous game with the hand of orlac and the wolf man ,
it is somewhat entertaining .
available on its own 
or in the box set scream queen vol .
