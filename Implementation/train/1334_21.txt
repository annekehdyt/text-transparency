i watched the first 15 minute ,
thinking
it was a real documentary
( with an irritatingly overly dramatic `` on camera '' producer )
.when i realized
it was all staged i thought
`` why would i want to waste my time
watching this junk ? ? ''
so i turned it off
and came online to warn other person .
the character do not act in a believable way .
too much immature emotion .
for a guy
to travel half way around the world into a war torn country ,
he acted like a kid .
and i do not believe
it was because `` his character was so upset about the trade center bombing '' .very trite
and stupid.have you seen `` city of lost child '' ?
french dark fantasy film about a guy
who kidnaps kid
and steal their dream ... i liked it !
