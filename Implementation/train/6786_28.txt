`` a stage company cast finds themselves terrified
when a bizarre killer
known as 'the fiend ' target them for death .
a pair of reporter and their clumsy photographer set out
to work the story of 'the fiend '
and find themselves target as well .
just as you think
our trio of hero has the case solved ,
you are thrown another twist
that has you wondering
who the killer really is 
''
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.taking `` the hunchback of notre dame '' to hollywood 
producer sam katzman 's lack of studio
setting probably helps `` a face in the fog '' look interesting 
especially toward the end
( 1930s traffic ) .
the direction could be improved upon ;
for example 
the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful .
the budget appears slight .
under the circumstance 
most of the silent/talkie crossover cast perform it amiably .
**** a face in the fog
