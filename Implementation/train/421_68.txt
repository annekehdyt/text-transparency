i am not sure
if the filmmaker were after a saw-type movie or 12 angry man
( person piecing together the fact
to get at the truth ) .
whatever it was ,
it was poorly done
and not worth watching.i do not watch movie for blood and gore ,
but because this film had little else going for it ,
it should have shown the actual killing more .
most were off-camera ,
minimizing the horror
that we were supposed to feel by the death.it
also bugged me
that the cop was among the victim ;
he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man
going to prison
by accepting planted evidence
( given to him by mjh )
into the evidence room .
( and would not mjh a the prosecuting attorney ,
have had access to that evidence
-- taking it out
and putting the wrong evidence back
-- anyway ,
so she would not have needed the cop 's help ? ) .
the other ,
while often also not realizing
it was this particular person
they were harming ,
still played larger role in his ultimate demise .
the gun dealer should have know
his gun would be used for evil intent .
the insurance guy rejected a person
obviously in need 
etc .
but the cop 's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did not know
exactly what he was doing .
the filmmaker could have taken it a step further
and had him be the one
that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence ,
which would have made him more culpable .
and mjh 's yelling
that he
( the cop )
got her in that mess does not make any sense at all.it would been more intriguing
if each person died in a way
that offered the other a clue
to why he/she was there and deserved to die .
the insurance guy 
for example 
could have had the application
he rejected rammed down his throat
so he choked on them ;
the oriental woman could have had her eye gouged out
because she was a false witness 
etc .
yes 
more violent
that the gun death ,
but more interesting.the dialog was not witty ,
there were no twist ,
and the ending was one of the worse
( if not the worst )
i have ever seen .
the ending along knocked three star off my rating.the actor did a decent job ,
especially given the garbage line and motivation
they had to work with.overall 
a waste of time .
