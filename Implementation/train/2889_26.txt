too bad neither the animal or eddie murphy had anything
to say worth saying .
this movie is just bland.children 's movie ?
well 
if you are trying to get them to take a nap 
then maybe .
it is just 90 minute of some eye-wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips
that are not funny .
and the lip-sync'ing makes the old godzilla film look illiantly
done by comparison .
meanwhile 
eddie `` pluto nash '' murphy drone on with a suppressed understated delivery
that is painful to experience .
apparently 
he is trying to modify his old manic persona 
but to what ?
in short 
all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining ,
or whatever it is .
a town wants to bully some forest creature
and blame them for doing bad stuff .
no 
really .
and pluto nash can psycho-babble with them .
thing chain along with some stale joke to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises.rent the '67 movie .
or some old yogi bear cartoon .
