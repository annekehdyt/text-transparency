a different look at horror .
the styling difference between american and russian film is interesting .
however from my american perspective this movie just was not that good .
the protagonist 
marie
played by anastasia hille
was not a pleasant character and i
had a hard time
identifying with her .
she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left .
also too much time was spent in inging her to the main location of the film .
then a long time passed
before any real suspense built up .
once
that happened
it seemed volume
was used as the main effect
which was more annoying than anything else .
the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movie
and they did not use sex
to make up for a thin plot .
all in all i would recommend it for renting 
but not for theater goer .
