this movie is horrible .
everything in it has been done before .
there is nothing original .
i can not stand
when writer do not come up with their own plots.a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult .
hmm 
sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s
called big .
what is even more annoying is jennifer garner 's acting .
she does not act like she is 13
she just act like she is stupid.from then on ,
you can guess the whole plot .
she gets a good job
and it just so happens
that a friend she had at 13 work with her .
wow 
how awesome !
but 
no ... .her friend is bad
and turns on her ,
trying to get her job .
but 
of course 
she wins in the end
when she comes up with a `` great '' idea.there
is also a dancing scene in the movie
that i have seen a thousand time before.i hate this movie .
