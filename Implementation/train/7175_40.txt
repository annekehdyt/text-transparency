who says
zombie can not be converted into useful member of the community ?
certainly not the maker of `` fido 
''
who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950 's where the undead have been turned into butler and servant for the burgeoning middle class .
timmy robinson is the all-american boy
who becomes emotionally attached to the family 's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie
whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido .
all of this has been made possible by zomcom 
a big-other-type organization
that has found a way
to render the zombie
( who were originally ought to `` life '' by radiation from outer space )
manageable and docile - at least most of the time.this twisted 
modern-day spin on the tv series `` lassie '' -
it might easily have been entitled `` a boy and his zombie '' -
takes slyly satirical swipe at such pre-'60s concern as obsessive social conformity
( here keeping-up-with-the-jonese means having more zombie servant than the folk next door ) ,
the sterility of suburban life 
the corporate control of civic affair 
small town corruption and nuclear family value - all played out in a beautifully
designed setting of parti-colored house and immaculately manicured lawn .
the movie does not hit the audience over the head with its message
nor does it engage in endless hyperbole
to generate laugh .
instead 
this is a low-keyed ,
subtle little satire
that elicits appreciative chuckle rather than full-bellied guffaw .
much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude toward death
demonstrated by the fine citizen of the community
( life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine ) .
despite some playfully graphic violence ,
the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950 's itself and the cheesy 
low-budget horror movie
that were so much a part of the pop culture scene
of that decade.k'sun ray 
carrie-ann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed timmy and his cleaver-esquire parent
( with slightly sinister undertone ) ,
while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of inging a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.this is what `` lassie '' might have been had timmy 's best friend been afflicted rabies .
