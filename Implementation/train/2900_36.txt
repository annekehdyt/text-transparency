i have come to realise from watching euro horror 
especially film
made by cult luminary jess franco ,
that you can not expect a plot
that makes much sense .
however 
franco has gone overboard with this film ;
and despite a surreal atmosphere ,
and the film 's reputation as one of the director 's best - succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film .
i have got to admit
that i saw the american cut version ,
which runs at about 76 minute ;
but unless it was just the logic
that was cut ,
i am sure
the longer european version is just as boring .
the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around ;
practicing sandm and talking rubbish ,
and it is all really boring .
there is no gore
and the sex is dull ,
and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue
and despite the fact
that this is a short film ;
i had difficulty
making it all the way to the end .
i have to say
that the location look good and franco has done a good job
of using his surreal atmosphere ;
but the positive element end there .
jess franco is definitely a talented director
that has made some classic trash film -
but this looks like it was one
he made for the money ,
and overall i recommend skipping it
and seeing some of the director 's more interesting work .
