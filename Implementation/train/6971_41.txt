i was always curious about this film
because it is so tough to find ,
so
when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the $ 10
and bought it ,
now i understand
why its so rare !
this film is so bad ,
so terribly written and hopelessly low budget
that the ending credit ,
which show all of the cut scene
where they fumbled their line ,
are literally the movie 's highlight .
the film is about a psychic
( pettyjohn 
cast for one obvious reason 
her topless scene )
whom uses her power with an experimental machine
to pull object from another dimension into this reality .
when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws
it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it ,
and gee 
what do you know ?
surprise !
a kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out ,
instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face ,
then escapes to a nearby city .
but rather than deploy half the armed force of the county
to find it
and protect the public those in charge
just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray
to find it on their own 
but no matter 
this movie blows all its credibility long before then .
this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me
only because of unintentional laugh ,
somebody need to alert the producer of `` mystery science theater 3000 ''
if they do not know about it already !
2 out 10 
really 
really bad !
