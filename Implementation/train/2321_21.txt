you would not expect a movie like this to be good ,
and it is not .
it is a no budget ,
ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad
looking hand-held camera ...
and it is hilarious .
the actor obviously have never acted before
and it shows in their terrible hilarious reading .
there is no plot
to be seen .
the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple family .
the gore effect are actually some of the most sickening i have ever seen .
it seems the gore effect person raided a butcher shop for all the body part ,
and many scene
involve zombie dismembering person
and eating their organ .
it is a funny and sickening film ,
and it is about as bad
as you can get in term of any movie.my rating :
bomb/**** .
90 min .
