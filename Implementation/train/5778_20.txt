adorable !
i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kid .
we all liked it so much
that we saw it a second time with my parent .
i have not heard them laugh like that in year !
it was the first time
that i can remember seeing a movie
that my parent and my kid could enjoy .
it is really cute
and we can not wait for it to come out on dvd .
they need to make more movie like domestic import .
it is refreshing to go to a movie
that three different generation can enjoy
( and not be embarrassed ) .
i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding .
i loved mindy sterling as the mother .
she was also in austin power .
howard hesseman is in this too
and he is hilarious .
i remember him from wkrp .
