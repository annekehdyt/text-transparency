fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few fault .
the first thing
about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho .
season one 's 'deep throat ' takes place near ellen air base 
also in southwest idaho .
i am wondering
if the air force basis are one and the same
but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry .
mulder and scully have some good dialog 
always a plus .
ed meecham 
the zoo keeper 
reminds me of cranky 
old school teacher .
they must have liked child at one time ,
you just can not imagine how .
just like he must have cared more for animal at one point .
i liked the concept of the episode ,
but i felt
it had some inconsistency .
if alien are so adept at abducting human and returning them safely ,
why can not they put the animal back in the right place ?
and the alien are just now having problem
returning the animal ?
i do not buy mulder 's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum .
as if he is an expert on that .
i also thought
jayne atkinson 's performance as willa amose was not well done .
besides those nitpick ,
i still enjoyed this episode
because of the intriguing concept of alien harvesting animal dna as well as human dna .
