with this movie being the only dirty harry movie
which clint eastwood not only stars 
but produces and directs as well ,
you know
it is got to be good .
although some say
that the enforcer is the best out of the series ,
i completely disagree .
in my opinion 
apart from the original dirty harry 
sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series .
although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequence ,
it does not get the dirty and gritty impact
that the other three film do .
this film captures all the excitement
that makes a clint eastwood film good ,
and it is got the quote
that make a dirty harry film good .
in diry harry it is `` ..well do ya 
punk ?
`` ; in magnum force `` a man 's got to know his limitation '' ;
and in this it is `` go ahead .
make my day . ''
also in this film it is nice to see a change of scenery ,
as you get a bit tired
of seeing the same old san fransisco street in the other film in the series .
with great
acting by clint eastwood and co-star sandra locke ,
and good directing by clint 
this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever .
