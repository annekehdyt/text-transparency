father and son communicate very little .
in fact they speak different language .
but when the son drives his father 3000 mile for his pilgrimage 's to mecca ,
the conversation finally take place .
they are difficult
and growth is necessary on both parts.this movie takes us into the heart of these two traveler ,
and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principal .
the imagery throughout is impressive 
especially the final scene in mecca .
it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be ,
but also at the same time 
how similar .
the same was true for the father and son in this film.see this movie .
tell your friend to see it .
you will be glad you did .
