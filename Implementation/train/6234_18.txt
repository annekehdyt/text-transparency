the female lead was a terrible actress
which made the whole movie mediocre .
she was smiling too much
when she first went in front of the camera
to talk about her daughter .
this should have made the police suspect her .
i would have been inconsolable in the identical situation .
she seemed way calm for a mother
who could not find her daughter .
it was as if
she did not want to even be in the movie .
jennifer aniston would have played the part better .
and it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial 
important subject .
everyone else was excellent .
i do not know
where the lead actress is but i hope
she got some acting lesson .
