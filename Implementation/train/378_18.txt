this will be a different kind of review .
i have seen this movie twice on tv
and would like to have a copy
because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there .
it was the first movie i would seen by ashley judd
and she was great
and i have enjoyed every other thing
i have seen her in .
sundance 's reaction made an impression on me too ,
as did the director 
victor nunez ,
who has directed
and written several movie about florida .
this movie speaks to me and i have seen nothing with which to compare it .
the plot speaks less to me than the surrounding .
well 
i told you
it would be a different kind of review .
