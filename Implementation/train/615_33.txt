i am
sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it ;
after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii .
with the cast 
the location 
style of the directing and its publicity \u0096 shows woman walking around on the beach and all that .
no wonder person have misconception
and decide not to watch it.it was wrong of them to do that .
cause
after i decide to watch the show ,
there are actually more thing going on 
real juicy story and conflict ,
turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much \u0096 addictive.the story of the hotel clerk 
the manager 
the owner and their complicated love life .
also enter the troublesome hotel 's visitor and powerful man
trying to steal the hotel .
it actually more exciting than it sounds here.i will not deny
that the acting suck but it are not that bad
that you will look away .
the story is not so consistence but good enough .
the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario
and the action is all the time .
i took me couple of episode
before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience.recommendation :
i really do enjoy watching this .
zillion time better than expected.rating :
7.5/10
( grade :
b )
please rate my review
after reading it 
thank .
