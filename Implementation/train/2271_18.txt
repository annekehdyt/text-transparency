how to lose friend and alienate person
is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach.it
is actually a story of sidney young
( simon pegg )
eaking through in journalist and magazine writing business
which is interpreted in a funny way .
simon pegg made an ok appearance 
slightly worse than his usual .
movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that
but it has its moment ,
and those moment are really hilarious.i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all person
who just wan na sit 
relax and enjoy movie
for what it is .
if you are about to watch this movie with critical approach
then you should pass
unless you want to be disappointed
and start trashing it .
