this movie is likely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
-- surpassing the previous most god-awful movie 
`` spawn of slithis 
''
which i saw
when i was about 10.bad acting 
stilted and ridiculous dialog 
incomprehensible plot 
mishmashed cut scene ,
even the music was annoying .
did i leave anything out ?
well 
the special effect were not bad
-- but cgi does not a decent movie make.i can not believe
i actually spent money
to see this movie .
if anyone has the contact info for hyung-rae shim
( the director ) ,
please forward it to my user name `` at gmail 
''
and i will contact him to personally demand a refund .
