i originally saw this film year ago during cinemax friday after dark series
( back
when the cable box was built like a keyboard ) ,
and it intrigued me .
even though there is a pointless aspect to the film
it is well acted.the performance of depardieu and dewaere are very enjoyable.they have a good chemistry together
and miou-miou makes a pink fur look eathtaking.a movie like this probably would not be made in these politically correct time
( at least not in the us ) ,
since it seems to sensationalize thing like violence 
robbery 
and casual sex .
this movie proves
that with a talented cast and also talented
directing a good movie
is a good movie no matter
the subject.it saddened me
to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide and in the near future i ,
ll will check him out with depardieu and miou-miou
in get out your hankerchief .
