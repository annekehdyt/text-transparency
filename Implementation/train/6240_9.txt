this is one of jacky best film
that is him
without opera buddy sammo hung and yuen biao
it has one of the best opening in any action film
and it carrys on in that way with jackie
showing some high quality stunts
the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow
but it shows up for a frantic last 25 min in the film and the end credits show
what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addict happy
