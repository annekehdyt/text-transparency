if you have ever seen the trailer for the film `` the recruit '' with colin farrell and al pacino ,
you will never have to see that film .
sadly 
renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.the story of renaissance is about a detective
investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher .
the setting is a futuristic paris ,
and science fiction elements feature throughout .
the special thing about renaissance 
though 
is its visual style 
and not its story .
renaissance is 3d computer animation 
like final fantasy ,
but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrast .
the result looks stunning
( although the problem of 3d animation of human being are still noticeable from time to tome :
slightly robotic movement 
slightly wooden facial acting 
etc )
as a highly stylised 
beautiful film noir 
renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience 
especially visually .
the story and writing 
though 
are not quite at the same level of quality as the visual .
it is not a bad story
( and presumably ,
if you have not seen the trailer ,
it is a lot more exciting
than it was for me ) .
but it is a story
that is not highly original ,
and verge on the corny .
a few line of dialogue were painfully corny ,
making the writing sound like a beginner 's first efforts.i will definitely recommend renaissance to friend .
it is unlike anything i have seen before 
visually ,
and i believe
its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience .
it is also a watchable story ,
even if it is not perfect .
