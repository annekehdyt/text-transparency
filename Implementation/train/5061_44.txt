i am watching this on the star world network overseas
which buys american and canadian series
that last one or two season like the jane show .
i thought
of how many female lead comedy show im actually able to watch on my own ,
there is lucy 
bewitched 
i dream of jeanie
( the one with barbara feldman ) ,
and then my mind goes kind of blank i can not think of any other ,
the woman are all supporting role not the lead .
so for me 
the jane show is in pretty good company .
one thing i just thought of though .
i have watched several thing
made in canada ,
and i never recall any thing
being filmed in a regular tv series
that show snow !
it is all made at the height of summer 
lol !
granted it is a great place to live climate wise in the summer
but you would think ,
they would show a little bit of canada in the winter
since that is part of the lifestyle there also .
i mean sctv 
just for laugh come to mind as two comedy show
that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present
even though they both do a lot of outdoor shot .
i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal way being accused of racism to her neighbor 
and i like the bald guy and his craziness ,
i found it on par with a uk series
called the it crowd
( i think )
another office comedy with a female lead .
not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy
to say
he can watch it alone ,
that saying something .
if i was with my wife
she might really enjoy it
since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like
that so might be a good light comedy for couple to watch .
7 of 10 .
