this was one of the best show
ever made for tv .
full of mystery and intrigue and twist and turn .
compulsive viewing .
i was lucky i saw this in the uk .
they might have got the episode order wrong ,
i can not remember ,
but it at least was on at a regular time every week .
my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in ,
and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally.after the pilot ,
we knew
this was something special .
we missed a couple of episode ,
and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those one lol.great casting 
superb acting .
gary cole was absolutely illiant 
better even than his role as custer .
lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid ,
and paige turco was at her best too since party of five .
and nick searcy of course 
as the sheriff 's long suffering sidekick.ye 
there were some confusing and perplexing bit ,
which i presume would have been explained later ,
and no doubt would have been in a later series .
that made the ending weak ,
and you could tell
they had killed it .
made us go what ?
why did they do that with one of the best show ever ?
shoot the exec .
