it was 1 a.m. in the morning
and i had nothing else to do .
do not judge me ... please.we are back in time during the spanish settlement .
a group have made their way
onto an island .
it does not take too long
before they encounter a large `` reptile '' ,
which gobbles up their horse .
soon they are captured by the native
and in order to gain freedom
they must kill the `` reptile god . ''
the cg sucks ; it reminds me of the cg of early console video game .
the encounter were lame .
the only positive thing i have to say
about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit .
otherwise it is just a middling effort .
