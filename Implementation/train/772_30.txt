it is funny ,
when you stop
and think about it :
fright film fan tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those
who scare the daylight out of them .
the texas chainsaw massacre may give us nightmare ,
but who among us
( the faithful )
did not feel a very real twinge of love for gunnar hansen in brutal massacre- or for ken foree ,
forever
and ever the resolute hero of the original dawn of the dead ?
his cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer
( as did tom savini 's cameo ) ;
i kid you not .
and brian halloran and ... well 
you get my drift
( if not 
just stand downwind ... ) .
these are some of the hero of horror .
to see this many of them gathered together in a single movie
is almost unheard of ( at least to this degree 
to my knowledge ) .
if only the writer
( s ) had been up to such a monumental task .
maybe someone else ,
somewhere along the line ,
will try again .
as long as it is not another half-hearted effort
( like brotherhood of blood 
for instance ) .
