i did not know what to make of this film .
i guess
that is what it was all about really .
i have never seen a film like it and i doubt
that i really ever will again .
glover puts together something
that is unique to him .
i think to appreciate
it you have to read some of his poetry 
maybe see one of his slide show .
i really like this guy ,
he is just so bizarre i can not help it .
note :
i saw this film
before it was through its final editing ,
so maybe what i have seen
and what other have seen are different .
i will know ,
i guess ,
if i choose to view the film again .
i think
i will have to be properly drug influenced ...
