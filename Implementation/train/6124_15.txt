i like to keep my review short and simple ,
but this pretty much sum it up .
you can not beat the original two for a number of reason
one
of which including the directing talent of chris columbous.this movie had terrible
directing covered up by even more terrible acting .
i can not even believe
these person are considered actors.painful to sit through and watch .
the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorist on a painstaking quest
to get it back .
horrible 
rent one of the original tow
and enjoy yourself !
the movie was not even set during christma like the original .
home alone was turned from an excellent christma time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot !
