this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder .
he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery .
no one could have done it better .
the suspense was palpable throughout .
i wish mr. wilder would grace us with another of these .
i have enjoyed
everything i have ever seen mr. wilder in but i had no idea
how truly talented he was until i saw `` murder in a small town 
'' and this follow-on .
he truly has a firm grasp on what audience want and how to deliver it in his writing and 
of course 
in his illiant acting .
his subtle wit comes through in spade .
i would recommend this movie to anyone
who likes mystery and/or gene wilder 's film work .
his star just gets ighter and ighter .
