amazing .
that is what you would say
if you sat through this film .
simply 
incredibly 
amazing .
it is actually so amazing
that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity
that you simply can not believe
what you are seeing .
that 
my friend 
is what is truly scary about this film .
somebody thought
it was a good idea
to make it .
well 
here is another amazingly original story :
high school student
( occasionally seemed like college\u0097go figure )
has whore for a mom 
lives in a trailer park ,
and is an `` artist ''
who is ridiculed for his `` being all different . ''
well 
of course 
this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and ,
here is the original part 
his soul inhabits a scarecrow
( beneath which ,
he is killed by his slutty mama 's latest john ) .
then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the person
that done hurt him .
awww.here is the eakdown :
the good :
-- amazingly funny movie\u0097even
if that is not what the clearly drunk filmmaker wanted. --
this and the sequel on one disk in the wal-mart $ 5.00 bin\u0097so
it is only a little overpriced.did not hurt it ,
did not help :
-- the violence and gore are kind of sub-standard .
one person is stabbed with a corncob.
-- sounds like they put some effort into the music\u0097but
it does not really fit the movie\u0097and
is not all that good.the bad : --
terrible 
terrible acting. --
another slasher let-down with sexy women\u0097none of them removing clothing .
when did that cease being a staple of low-ow slasher ?
?
-- ridiculous story. --
the scarecrow vomits up one-liner
that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush. --
standard underlying love story goes nowhere ,
and is poorly done. --
some of the person killed seem like
they were chosen at random\u0097you
never really know
who anybody is and then
they are killed .
and you only assume
that they must 've had it coming.the ugly :
-- extremely average slasher fare 
just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well 
all
that other crap. --
nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger 
jason voorhee 
pinhead 
chucky 
or even angela from the `` sleepaway camp '' series\u0097all of which are better than this atrocity. --
the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life .
the script is laden with a level of retardedness
that i never imagined
could exist .
i
am serious here\u0097it
is a full step beyond terrible .
do not get me wrong 
though ,
it is funny as hell\u0097but i have never heard more asinine banter\u0097even in `` slumber party massacre iii . ''
this film makes `` jason x '' look like shakespeare.
-- the man
who kills the boy
that becomes the scarecrow :
worst wig ever .
dialogue to match.memorable scene :
-- the one
where elementary-school youth spew out their own witty dialogue :
`` hey 
let 's go find small animal to torture .
huh huh .
`` acting :
3/10 story :
3/10 atmosphere :

violence/gore :
5/10
( low quality 
mediocre amount )
dialogue :
0/10
( extremely ridiculous 
blatant 
over-the-top and painfully funny\u0097so bad
it is good .
my first rating for dialogue in any film ! )
music :
5/10 direction :
2/10cheesiness :
10/10 crappiness :
9/10overall :
3/10another one for just person like me
who enjoy watching pure crap .
or slasher-film completist .
this is not a good movie 
at all .
laughable dialogue and character keep
it from being truly boring.www.residenthazard.com
