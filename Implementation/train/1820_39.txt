the secret of kell is a film i
have been waiting for for year
after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny .
i am here
to tell you now it is been worth the wait .
the cartoon are heavily stylised
but not annoyingly so
as i would feared .
the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination ,
i particularly love the animated illuminated book
where the little figure come to life on the page .
the characterisation is superb ,
i love brendan gleeson 's voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling .
the forest is a triumph 
such a beautiful place .
the story is well realised 
a mix of fact and fantasy .
and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect material for the book .
i am a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway
so the subject is close to my heart ,
but all the person i know
who 've seen this
and are not fan of the craft agree
that it is a lovely little film .
i will definitely buy the dvd
when it is released ,
and would like to say ,
well done cartoon saloon and all the person
involved in this mammoth project .
may there be many more .
: )
coming back in here
to say
that i bought several copy of the dvd as soon as i could
and gave them out at christmas ,
everyone loves it !
and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscar 
such a joy
to see this nominated .
