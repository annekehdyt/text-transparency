this is a good movie 
a good family movie to watch
if you have nothing else to do .
if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book ,
you will be very very disappointed .
i was somewhat disappointed
because i read the book a few time
when i was in elementary school.this
is about a new kid in town
named billy .
he makes a bet with the school bully
and the bet is not like most bet .
billy has to eat 10 worm in one day or the bully wins.the acting is ok 
probably the worst part of the movie .
the kid actor over exaggerate on many thing .
they think
it is apocalypse
if billy does not eat the worm .
hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job ,
though.the plot line is good as a movie ,
but it sucks as a book adaptation .
i was able to watch this movie
without looking at the time ... .sometime.overall ,
this was a good family movie with some weak point .
i rate this movie 7/10 .
