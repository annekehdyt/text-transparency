if you have not figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minute
then give it a couple more minute .
lilia is a widow .
she has been left on the shelf for too long
and she wants to burst out .
she has a teenage daughter
which only highlights
that she is not getting any younger .
while checking up on her daughter
she discovers a world
she never dared ... the cabaret ,
where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfit
while man throw money at her .
the film is very misogamist .
it is portrayal of man
is dismal .
which is rather odd as lilia stoop to jiggle around for them 
not for money ,
but just for the hell of it .
when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again .
she does not wish to connect with them
but she is addicted to the attention .
the other dancer all are mostly aging woman
who look like man in drag
and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived .
not short enough i say .
she does find romance ,
however ief ,
with you guessed
it ... .no surprise here
we did not see coming .
though the ending is good you realize
that it could have ended no other way .
maybe this film just is not targeting my demographic- 30 male
