i was speechless
and devastated after my first viewing of this - many part of grey garden are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not 
this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstake .
i kept focusing on how these woman
( who are clinically way beyond eccentric )
reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of way 
and i wonder
whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe 
perhaps some abuse 
or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion
that spiralled out of their control
and took on a life of its ' own .
this might be one of the greatest ever film
that comes dangerously close to exploitation ,
without going completely over the edge -
as the edy do their thing ,
i kept noting thing like the empty gin bottle in the rubble-strewn bedroom 
cat urinating on the bed 
racoon emerging from hole in the wall ,
and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child 's birthday party gone seriously wrong .
very definitely worth
seeing and seeking out -
you will never forget it 
but very disturbing .
