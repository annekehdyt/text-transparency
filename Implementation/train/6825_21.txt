excellent view of a mature woman 
that is going to lose everything
( even the pruner has a mortgage ) .
the way
she gets involved into this special `` business '' ,
the innocence 
and the true love
that exists between the person of a little town ,
it is mixed perfectly to give us
as result a fresh 
light and funny comedy .
i could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old lady in a drugstore.i love european film ,
and with movie like this one 
my opinion grow stronger .
a movie
that i also recommend with my eye closed 
in this same genre ,
is waking ned devine.saving grace 
a comedy
that many friend enjoyed as much as myself .
you will love it .
