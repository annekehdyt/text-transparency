this is one of may all-time favourite film .
parker posey 's character is over-the-top entertaining ,
and the liarian motif will not be lost on anyone
who has ever worked in the book
and stack world.if you are a liary student 
rent this .
then buy the poster
and hang it on your wall .
the soundtrack is highly recommendable too .
i have shown this film to more liary friend than any other
-- they all fall in love with it .
