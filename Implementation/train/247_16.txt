there are often badly-matched couple
( in the general sense of the term )
-in huston 's movie : ''
african queen '' `` heaven knows mister allison '' `` root of heaven '' `` misfit '' ... '' the barbarian and the geisha ''
( check the title )
is another good example ,
so to speak.it seems
that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such work as `` sayonara '' `` the world of suzie wong '' and `` the teahouse of the august moon '' bear witness .
huston 's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot
( with the exception of `` susie `` maybe )
.john wayne perfectly fits in ford 's world ,
in huston 's he is like a bull in a china shop.his japanese partner is totally bland.even the dramatic scene
( cholera epidemic )
do not save the movie from absolute boredom.only those utterly enamoured of huston 's every work need
to choose this ,
among all his other great movie around .
