this movie is a true masterpiece ,
it really is .
it is rare you come across such a heartwarming flick 
full of fun 
laughter 
hearteak 
and with a little drama
to keep you on your to .
a true family film 
homeward bound tells the story of three ave pet ,
who set out
to cross the rocky mountain in an attempt
to find their owner ,
following the change
they go through
and the obstacle
they encounter along the way .
one of the truly stunning thing
about this movie is its ability
to give animal human personality - the voice
acting is that good .
shadow is a wonderful character 
old 
wise and ave ,
and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment .
chance -
who would not love a dog like chance ?
he is got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen .
and sassy is very witty for a cat -
she had me in stitch
when she was mocking the keeper ;
'here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life 
chubby . '
there were also lot of well made emotional scene 
such as sassy going over the waterfall
( i was truly scared for her ) ,
shadow falling in the ditch
( almost in tear )
and then the fantastic ending ,
when all three pet return home ...
including good old shadow !
a favourite for all time - anyone
who does not like this film
must just not like animal .
rent it or buy it now ,
and it will leave you with happy memory
that 'll last a lifetime .
