having read many of the comment here ,
i am surprised
that no one has recognized this
as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960
called `` mirror image 
''
starring vera mile .
rod serling did a much better job
of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minute
than sean ellis did in 88 minute with this tedious snooze .
a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending ,
but in a feature film 
there should be a bit more substance
and the story should make sense .
sadly 
substance and sense are two thing missing from `` the broken . ''
yes 
it has some moment ,
but they are not enough
to justify your time .
some further observation :
although this is clearly a contemporary story ,
not one character in the movie has a cellphone !
and even though a car accident is the event
that gets the story going ,
there is never any reference to an insurance company 
to the person
who was driving the other car 
or to the police
who would have been required
to do a report .
my advice :
skip this bore and watch the original instead !
