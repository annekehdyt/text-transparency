note to george litman 
and other :
the mystery science theater 3000 riff is `` i do not think so 
*eeder* ''
.my favorite riff is `` why were you looking at his 'like ' ?
`` 
simply for the complete absurdity .
that 
and `` right well did not ! ''
over all 
i would say
we must give credit to the mst3k crew
for trying to ridicule this tv movie .
you really can not make much fun of the dialog ;
bill s was a good playwright .
on the other hand 
this production is so bad
that even he would disown it .
a junior high school drama club could do better.i would recommend
that you buy a book and read 'hamlet ' .
