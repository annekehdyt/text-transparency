in my opinion 
this is the best stand-up show
i have ever seen .
i became an instant eddie fan
after seeing dress
to kill ,
but i must say
i think
this is his best work .
i would say 
though ,
if you ever get the chance
to definitely go see him live .
it is worth it ! most of the time
after seeing a stand-up routine a couple time ,
the joke start to get old .
but i have to say ,
i have seen this show so many time
that i literally have the entire thing memorized
( which yes ,
i realize is kinda sad )
but every joke still makes me laugh .
this is truly a feel
good show.dress to kill will never get old for me .
i own it
and watch it anytime i need a good laugh .
