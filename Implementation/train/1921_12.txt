dead husband is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wife
conspiring to bump off each other husband` .
it`s by no mean embarrassingly bad like some comedy i could mention
but it never fufils its potential .
imagine how good this could have been
if we had the farrelly other
directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson .oh
is carter based on jerry springer ?
just curious
because the catch phrase on dr elson`s show is `` look after each other
and keep talking
``
