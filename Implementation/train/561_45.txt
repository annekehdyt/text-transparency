back in the 1970s 
wpix ran `` the adventure of superman '' every weekday afternoon for quite a few year .
every once in a while ,
we 'd get a treat
when they would preempt neighboring show to air `` superman and the mole man . ''
i always looked forward to those day .
watching it recently ,
i was surprised at just how bad it really was.it was not bad
because of the special effect 
or lack thereof .
true 
george reeve ' superman costume was pretty bad 
the edge of the foam padding used
to make him look more imposing
being plainly visible .
and true 
the mole man 's costume were even worse .
what was supposed to be a furry covering
would not have fooled a ten year-old ,
since the zipper 
sleeve hem and badly pilling faic badly tailored into baggy costume were all painfully obvious .
but these were forgivable shortcomings.no ,
what made it bad were the contrived plot device .
time and again 
superman failed to do anything
to keep the situation from deteriorating .
a lynch mob is searching for the creature ?
rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creature himself ,
he stands around explaining the danger of the situation to lois and the pr man .
the creature are cornered ?
again 
he stands around watching
and talking but does not save them until they are shot .
luke benson 
the town 's rabble-rouser 
shoot at him ?
attempted murder to any reasonable person ,
but superman releases the man over and over
to cause more problem .
superman had quite a few opportunity to nip the problem in the bud ,
but never once took advantage of them.that said ,
both george reeve and phyllis coate played their character well ,
seemingly instantly comfortable in the role .
if only they had been given a better script
to work with .
