i am a big fan of horror flick ,
and zombie film are a particular favorite of mine .
that said ,
zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst film i
have ever seen .
so needless to say
i really enjoyed it ,
it is the best bad movie i have seen in a long while .
the story has some similarity with dan o'bannon 's `` return of the living dead '' ,
but wherea
that film was intentionally funny ,
this one is the opposite .
it has some of the most laughable acting i have ever witnessed 
especially from the main scientist character .
his scene with the general were just hysterical .
also 
the effect are subpar and in many case sloppy ,
and the death scene are often just downright stupid .
this 
of course 
makes it all the more fun .
possible spoiler - the worst is the scene
where the guy opens the refrigerator door
and sees the severed zombie head ,
which then opens its eye and somehow fly out of the fridge
( obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string ) ,
latching onto the guy neck ,
killing him .
zombie head have the ability to float in the air now ?
it defies every law of physic
known to man ,
and it is one of the most absurd thing ever filmed .
that is just one of many really goofy moment in the idiotic mess .
i can not believe
it is gotten so high a rating here .
if you are a fan of bad movie ,
do yourself a favor and rent this sucker .
