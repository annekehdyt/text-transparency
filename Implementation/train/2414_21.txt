oh dear .
i was so disappointed
that this movie was just a rip-off of japan 's ringu .
well 
i guess
the u.s. made their version of it as well ,
but at least it was an outright remake .
so 
so sad .
i very much enjoy watching filipino movie
and know
some great thing can come out of such a little country ,
so i can not believe this had to happen .
claudine and kris are such big name there ,
surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism .
to any aspiring movie maker out there in the philippine :
you do not have to stoop this low
to make money .
there are many movie buff
that are watching the movie filipinos put out
and enjoying them !
