i would not go so far as to not recommend this movie ,
since the only problem i
have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot device
used in the movie
- the sort of thing common to every kid movie ever made it seems .
that does not make it bad ,
just not something
i would go far.it is a little saccharine ,
so i might say
that for the most part anyone
looking for something with a little more wit could
be disappointed in an obviously for-kid movie like this.however ,
all of that goes out the window
when that squirrel
( the one in all the trailer )
comes on-screen .
his time is limited ,
but it seems apparent
that the decision maker had the wisdom
to tell these guy 'hey ,
could you stick in a little more squirrel ? '
every time it is getting intolerably dull .
that does not save the movie ,
but you can leave saying
'at least there was one aspect
where i could not stop laughing .
'and of course 
visually it will not disappoint ,
but that is almost a given with pixar flick .
of all of their stuff 
i would put this at the bottom ...
but that is not in itself bad .
