i remember
when this was in theater ,
review said
it was horrible .
well 
i did not think
it was that bad .
it was amusing
and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor
concerning family around holiday time.ben affleck is a rich guy
who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend .
he goes to visit the house
he grew up in and strikes a deal
to rent the family there for christmas .
i really liked the lawyer scene
where they sign a contract .
that was funny.so ,
he makes silly request of the family and even writes script for them to read .
of course 
the family has a hot daughter for the love interest .
and he learns
that the holiday are not so bad after all.also ,
the whole doo-dah act was funny ,
especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy ,
and the girlfriend 's parent did not even say anything about it .
and the part where doo-dah is hitting on his `` supposed daughter . ''
final verdict :
i thought
it is worth checking out
if you catch it on cable .
