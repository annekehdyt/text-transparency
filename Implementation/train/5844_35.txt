after reading through many of the review ,
i do not know
what movie some person were watching ,
but clearly it was not the same one i saw.this movie is horrible .
the acting 
primarily moore 's 
is just terrible .
the woman can not act .
nice tit ,
but she just can not act .
at no point did she come across as the actual character .
instead 
it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys.and
that is what this movie ultimately is
-- hollywood make-believe .
the training sequence are over the top .
the politic
-- over the top .
the political correctness
-- over the top .
the combat scene
-- you guessed it ,
over the top .
your mission is to get in and get out
without being detected .
so what do you do ?
why shoot off as many round
and make as much noise as possible 
of course .
oh g.i .
jane 
you can be my wing man anytime.the premise is good ,
but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it ,
we end up with top gun with tit.what more is to be expected from commercial us film anymore ?
not much i guess .
