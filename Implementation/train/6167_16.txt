the thing i remember
most about this film
is that it used to air on local ktla tv
( ch .
5 ) during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s 
mainly due to the fact
that the true story took place on or near christmas eve .
it was always a bit disturbing
to see the hell
that this girl goes through ,
being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle .
the graphic scene of this young girl
pulling leech out of her infected leg
made quite an impression on this young viewer .
not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time .
definitely not a rankin-bass production .
