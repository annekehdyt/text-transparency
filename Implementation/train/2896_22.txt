i actually saw this movie at a theater .
as soon as i handed the cashier my money ,
she said
two word i had never heard at a theater 
before or since :
`` no refunds ! ''
as soon as i heard those word ,
i should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home .
but no 
foolishly 
i went in
and watched the movie .
this movie did not make anyone in the theater laugh .
not even once .
not even inadvertantly !
mostly 
we sat there in stunned silence .
every ten minute or so 
someone would yell `` this movie sucks ! ''
the audience would applaud enthusiastically ,
then sit there in stunned ,
bored silence for another ten minute .
