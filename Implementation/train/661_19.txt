at first 
three word : read the book !
really guys - this demonstrates the difficulty of genuine rendition of esoteric matter .
i loved the book
and was utterly disappointed of the film .
it was ludicrous ,
with half a heart and the story bad explained .
the novel - in the first place !
- was not meant to focus on an adventure !
that is only the surrounding .
in the film 
the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat !
additional 
the visual effect
to show the energy of all
living thing and the elucidation of the event at the end
were parsimonious !
they screwed it up !
... i will never watch it again !
