the sequel to the ever popular cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the beauty and the beast movie .
it is basically three short story rolled into 1.ok ,
the mice are adorable
( i love gus !
he is sooo cute !
) ,
and lucifer 's awesome
( as usual ) .
i liked some of the newer character as well ,
( pom pom was adorable
and i did like prudence . ) .
still 
the storyline was somewhat limited ,
but still very cute .
so 
i vote 7/10 .
