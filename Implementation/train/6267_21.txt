i appreciated the photography 
the texture 
the colours and often 
unlike one comment 
the lighting .
what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.i
found
it often disjointed 
badly edited and at time difficult to follow .
my version was 110 minute ,
imdb shows one at 125m .
possibly the cut and subtitle did not help .
i applaud any film
that escape from the hollywood mould
but this left me disappointed .
miss gillain was luminous
and the performance were all fine ,
i just wanted a little more dialogue .
if anyone would like to see another film
that has some affinity with this one ,
try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet .
