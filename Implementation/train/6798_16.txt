it had all the clich\u00e9s of movie of this type and no substance .
the plot went nowhere
and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker
for watching it .
the production was good ; however ,
the script and acting were b-movie quality .
the casting was poor
because there were good actor mixed in with crumby actor .
the good actor did not hold their own nor
did they lift up the other .
this movie is not worthy of more word ,
but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten line .
jame wood and cuba gooding 
jr. play caricature of themselves in other movie .
if you are looking for mindless entertainment ,
i still would not recommend this movie .
