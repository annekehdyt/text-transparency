penn takes the time
to develop his character ,
and we almost care about them .
however there are some real problem with the story here ,
we see no real motivation for the evil other 's behavior ,
and the time line is screwed up .
supposedly set in 1963 ,
the music is late 60s/early 70s .
the reference and dialogue is 70s/80s .
the potential for a powerful climax present itself ,
and penn allows it to slip away .
but even with all these difficulty
it is worth the watch 
but not great .
