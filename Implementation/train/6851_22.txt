the alternate title of ecstasy 
is symphony of love ;
a title
which appropriately describes the mood
and feel of the film .
ecstasy is an early talkie ,
and could have very well been a classic film ,
if released during the silent film era .
this film is a visual treat ,
and is deliberately paced
so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality ,
which is presented in an artistic low-key fashion .
the director 's style is distinctly european .
the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated ,
than what was being produced in hollywood 
at that time .
consider the censorship code in the us 
during the 30 's 
that pretty much sum it up .
hedy lamarr 
one of the great beauty of all time 
was a perfect choice for this 'symphony of love . '
