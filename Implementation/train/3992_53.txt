this is a feel-good movie
and nothing more .
and for that 
it is great fun to watch .
sure it skims over political issue .
but so what ?
i am sure
she was not trying to make 'good night and good luck ' here .
let 's not try to make it anything else
but what it is ... light fare .
and very enjoyable at that ! do we remember
what 1984 was like ?
we have become very sophisticated according to the medium as far
as what we watch or not .
i tend to differ on this point .
goldie knew this was fun-fluff
and she went ahead
and did it.like her lightest fare :
protocol 
overboard 
housesitter 
wildcat 
private benjamin 
seems like old time 
foul play 
death becomes her 
first wife club and the remake of out-of-towners 
goldie knows
what she is doing ...
she plays every role for the camp
that you can get out of it !
goldie just knows herself really well ,
and she knows
what she can do really well.she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently .
i loved her in laugh-in and every thing
she is ever been in .
she has never tried to be anything else
but who she is ...
and that is that bubbling 
giggly 
girl next door
who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh
that will always endear me and remind me
that life is pretty short
and you have just got to lighten up
because
before you know
it ... you are old 
wrinkled and suffering from one of life 's inevitable ailment .
if it even comes
that late.i appreciate goldie for what she is :
a lovable 
comic actress .
