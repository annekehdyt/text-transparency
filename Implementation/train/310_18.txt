i give this movie 7/10
because the villain were interesting in their role
and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting `` guess
who '' game .
the movie 
however 
needs more robin in it .
he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest .
i always thought
the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character ,
let alone knightwing .
this movie just continues that bad tradition .
the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance
which would not be so bad in one movie
if the romance was not so unbelievable .
it is still a good movie
if you are a batman fan and i
would recommend watching it .
