ooof !
this one was a stinker .
it does not fall 'somewhere in between star war and thriller ' ,
that for sure .
in all actuality 
it falls somewhere between the crack of a wham !
video and captain eo 
only with not as big of a budget 
and a lot more close up of ugly teenager crying .
simon le bon preens front and center ,
while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact
that they stole their whole career from roxy music 's last 3 album .
brief clip from barbarella add nothing .
avoid at all cost .
( however 
i liked the part
when they played 'hungry like the wolf '
but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman
painted with tiger stripe ?
i mean 
they are not singing 'eye of the tiger ' or 'hungry like the tiger '
it is a wolf !
whatever . )
a dvd of duran duran 's '80 videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia 's sake
