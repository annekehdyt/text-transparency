when my sister said
this movie was gon na be good i
had second thought
but i watched it
and it was actually funny .
basically the movie is made of a weird girl
who goes to a small town
where no one likes her
and she just wants to go there
and get the reading of her aunt will don
so she can go .
but its not all that easy .
in this movie you will come across hilarious humor 
a witch 
a book of spells/recopy 
a mentally challenged uncle and a dog .
you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyway i hope you run right out
and try to find this really old movie .
hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 ... .
no i am totally joking ill give it a 9 hope
you understand
that you will laugh ,
you will scream
and you may just be offended.love your truly :
