the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many film do .
the film props itself as a fun and entertaining time .
and that is exactly what it was .
it is the korean version of a male bring
it on.from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film
and how it will end
but the enjoymant is not in the surprise twist
nor is it the way
the film is a carbon copy of another .
instead 
the enjoymant is held in the journey
of how the 2 remaining `` thug '' came to be man in their own right .
therefore 
the film is fun and entertaining.the camera work ,
specially the dolly move were very well executed .
the script ,
being a tad weak ,
was overly enjoyable in the fact
that the character were not 2 dimansional
but they were full of life and desire .
this film will not win any oscar 
nor any dvd blockbuster sale 
but a fun watch and a fun experience .
