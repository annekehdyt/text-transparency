this excellent series 
narrated by laurence olivier 
illiantly 
it should be said ,
charts the beginning to the end of world war 2. the origin are not entirely examined fully from germany 's fall at the hand of the versaille treaty
which helped propel hitler 's demonic rise ,
but as one reviewer says ,
that must be hard to do 
in a 26-part series with so much to cram in .
apart from the expected combat photography/action ,
there are plenty of personal 
emotional and human tragedy
that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight ,
especially if you are not necessarily a world war 2 buff/fan .
episode showing 'testimoney '
and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary 
britain 
germany 
japan 
russia and the u.s.a. were quite eye-opening .
showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the suffering of civilian 
the death camp etc. 
were very well handled and exposed .
i would fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation
( of which it could be said
i am one at 47 !
) .certain thing are quite strangely left out 
like the advent of the new jet era beginning 
with frank whittle 's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor 's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 -
especially as the v-1 was seen making its debut
and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2 .
this is probably a small oversight ,
not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapon
which ww2 ought forward from a more barren old science .
but a great series
that made its mark
and has done so ever
since
when thankfully repeated .
a series to own as a box set in history term ,
on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan .
jeremy isaacs and thame tv should be well proud .
