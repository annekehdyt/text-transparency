it is not un-common to see u.s. re-make of foreign movie
that fall flat on their face ,
but here is the flip side ! ! !
this is an awful re-make of the u.s. movie `` wide awake '' by the british !
`` wide awake '' is strange but entertaining and funny !
`` liam '' on the other hand is just strange .
i must give credit to `` liam '' for one thing ,
and that is making it clear
that i made the right choice
in changing my religion !
