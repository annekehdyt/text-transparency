we went to the movie with a group
because the play we were going
to was cancelled .
it is without doubt one of the worst movie ever .
it is not that i do not like cult-movie i do .
but nothing happen in the film .
one does not feel any connection with the character whatsoever .
endless time without dialog .
and the car .
how do thay carry a huge tent and bed chair and clothing for every day in that car ?
it is a two seater !
i have to say
however the scenery is beautiful ,
but not in a movie ,
the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie ,
so that we could skip about 80 minute of useless time in with nothing happen anyway .
i would not recommend it ,
as it is a waste of your time
