this movie chronicles the life and time of william castle .
he made a series of low budget horror film in the 1950s-1960
that he sold with gimmick .
in `` 13 ghost '' you need viewer to see the ghost
( they were in color ,
the film was in bandw ) .
`` the tingler '' had theatre seat equipped with a buzzer
that jolted the audience
when a monster escapes into a movie theatre .
`` marae '' issued a life insurance policy to all member in case
they were frightened to death !
the movie themselves were pretty bad
but the gimmick had person rushing to see them .
in this doc there are interview with director
inspired by castle 
actor in his movie and his daughter .
it also gets into his home life and the kind of man
he was
( by all account
he was a great guy ) .
the documentary is affectionate 
very funny and absolutely riveting .
it is very short
( under 90 minute )
and there is never a dull moment .
a must see for castle fan and horror movie fan .
my one complaint
-- there were very few sequence shown from his picture .
that aside this is just great .
