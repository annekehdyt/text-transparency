this movie should have never been made .
from the poorly done animation 
to the beyond bad acting .
i am not sure at what point the person behind this movie said
`` ok 
looks good !
let do it ! ''
i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was .
at one point ,
which very may well have been the worst point ,
a computer generated saber tooth of gold fall from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cat in the mouth ... uh 
ooookkkk .
the villain of the movie was a paralyzed saetooth
that was killed within minute of its first appearance .
the other two manage to kill a handful of person prior
to being burned and gunned down .
then 
there is a random one awaiting victim in the jungle ...
which scares me for one sole reason .
will there be a part two ?
god 
for the sake of human everywhere i hope
not.this movie was pure garbage .
from the power point esquire credit to the slide show ending .
