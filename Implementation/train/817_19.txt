the planning episode were a bit dull ,
but
when they reached the desert
it was quite fun to watch .
the reason
why i call it the most realistic reality show
is because 
much to my surprise 
charley fell out of the race relatively early .
when his hand were sore ,
i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix ,
but instead he actually quit the race .
the most anxious moment of the show must 've been
when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food !
the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it .
overall 
not as great as the long way round ,
but definitely an interesting watch ,
as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world .
