this is possibly the most boring movie in history .
i was really looking forward
to seeing this movie
given the actor/director roman polanski .
i think
i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again .
it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage .
my apology to those of you
who apparently liked this movie
however you probably liked new coke as well .
i am at a loss
to see
why anyone would have enjoyed this movie ,
it is slow 
dull
and has no real plot .
you wait for 105 minute for the movie
to get started .
i understand
this was made in 1976
however this was an era of bad television all around .
thank god disco and three 's company are gone along with stop sign glass and the bay city roller .
oh well just my thought .
