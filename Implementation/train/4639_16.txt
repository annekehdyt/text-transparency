well i do disagreed with the other comment posted .
piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other film
that were mentioned.specially about non real character ,
i think
that someone just wrote that
only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did
( and i am not spanish ) ,
is a very real film with real character 
very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan.about be a european film in contrast with an american film ,
well we different society ,
personally i dislike american modern film a lot
( i like the classic and some of the andy american film
but they are very few )
.is a film about the continuous constitution of a person 
liked or not we all make mistake
but some can learn about the mistake .
