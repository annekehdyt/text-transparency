one of the best
( if not the best )
stephen king 's screening .
dark as dark can be ,
surprising non-hollywood ending 
terrifying atmosphere 
amazing book adaptation 
outstanding cast 
educational
( do not play with afterlife ) ,
in short - everything an excellent horror should be ... my favorite horror movie 
straight 10+ .
