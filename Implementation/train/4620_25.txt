i have seen many a horror flick in my time 
all of them absurdly bad ,
but none reach the depth
that this piece of trash lower itself to .
this movie made me angrier and angrier
as i watched it
as i tried to wrap my head around
exactly what this movie was about .
now ,
after i have seen it ,
i understand - sort of - what was going on and why ,
but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable
when you are watching it .
yes 
there are the customary scene of gratuitious violence 
one-liner
that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its character
( `` the highway belongs to me ... me !
`` ) 
and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the `` plot '' ,
but still you will leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of 
like a puppy
who is not wanted anymore
and is left in a box by the side of the road .
blech .
