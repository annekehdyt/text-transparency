simply 
one of the funiest movie i have ever seen .
it is a parody of crime-life ,
parody of everything
that represents the chicago 1930.- there is no realy need to underestimate this movie
because rating is under 5. its a opinion of a mass ,
and mass is hypnotized .
who decide to watch it -
it will regret ,
who decide not to watch it -
will regret more .
