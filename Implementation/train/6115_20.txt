absolutely trash .
i liked halloween and from then on johnny 's been in a downward spiral .
this is about the pit .
we get it john .
pro-lifer are scary !
you do not have to make a shitty film
that bores the hell out of me to 'tell ' me.the pacing is way off here .
it feels
like john did not have much to work with here .
to his credit it looks like
he did not write this junk .
there are countless time
where the camera just sit
and wait for the actor to look dumb or say something dumb .
i love the long cut .
too bad carpenter does not know how to employ it .
he needs to bunk up with herzog and fassbinder 30 year ago .
please john 
stop making a fool
of yourself and boring me to death !
