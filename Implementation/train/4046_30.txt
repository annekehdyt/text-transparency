another attempt by modern japanese director
to redefine the chambara genre .
successful 
and not 
in varying degrees.buddhist monk has a vision
that he is to slay a legendary
( and very active )
demon at the gojoe idge in order to attain enlightenment .
while not at the forefront ,
buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie 
much like kurosawa 's `` ran '' .
it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me
although it is nowhere near `` ran 's '' league .
stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length .
the lead actor are uniformly excellent .
the music is really good .
the two weakness are the story and the fight scene .
the movie drags in the middle
which could have been fixed by some prudent editing .
and the fight scene are mostly filmed in blurry close-up .
this works for most of the film
but the finale feel like a cheat .
another recent film like this is tsui hark 's `` seven sword '' 
great film
but the promised fight scene are disappointing .
asano really does not move like a sword wielding demon ,
his acting is great
but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene.good movie ,
you will probably find
it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fight .
