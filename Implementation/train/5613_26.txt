revolt of the zombie
( 2 outta 5 star )
no 
this is not a long-lost ancestor to the classic george a. romero zombie flick .
this is a low-budget potboiler from 1936
that probably seemed very cool to audience of the time ...
but seems awfully routine these day .
there is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldier ...
and a close-up of bullet entering the bare chest of one of them .
the effect looks hopelessly fake these day but in 1936 i am sure
it had audience gasping .
the story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ...
ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army ...
but later as a means for one character
to win the woman
he loves .
the movie is barely an hour long but move at a snail 's pace
so it seems feature-length ,
believe me !
there really is not much to recommend it ... you may get some amusement from the faked studio shot of the star `` wading '' through a `` swamp '' .
the ending is interesting ...
so i would say
the movie is worth seeing at least once .
more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap `` 4 movie on 1 dvd '' compilation at wal-mart for five buck .
hey 
it is well worth the money ...
