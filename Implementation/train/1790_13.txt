what can i say about this movie ?
i have seen
it quite a few time since the first time
when i was around 6. i
have seen the english version
and it is done very well .
it is a great movie for all age ,
but it is directed more for child .
i love the childlike humor
and appreciate it .
if you have not seen it ,
you should try to rent a copy ,
you will not be disappointed !
