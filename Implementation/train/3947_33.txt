i loved this movie .
it is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum vietnam ,
and this movie-sans combat scene and exciting bomb and gunfire- did it .
i had no idea
i would be so affected by it .
what an amazing look at how alien vet feel .
it was tough to watch 
quite frankly .
we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama ,
but this is so so different .
what happens
when they come back
and try to live a life ?
they can not .
it made me very aware of a large group of man
that are rattling around lost in america .
not able to relate ,
can not sleep 
can not have love affair ,
can not deal with `` normal society '' .
they feel totally apart .
this is a huge tragedy ,
and one
that is not addressed enough .
yeah 
we have changed our attitude about vietnam vet ,
we like them now ,
but so what ?
it does not seem to have made any difference to them .
it is too late ?
so it was a great film ,
but i cried a lot .
i have no other criticism .
