i only watched this movie
because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat .
but this is no swat .
swat had a plot and some likable character and made sense .
bullfighter had none of these .
i should have realized
that it could not possibly be any good 
after all ,
the always painfully bad michelle forbe had a starring role.one poster here
called the movie incoherent .
another called it the worst movie ever .
both gave the movie far too much credit .
i am
so glad i got it from the liary for free ,
yet i still feel ripped off.imdb need to include a `` 0 '' in the `` rate this film '' vote 
just for movie like this one .
