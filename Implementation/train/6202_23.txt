back to the root with `` like it is in heaven ''
- what are the real value of life ?
these swede carve out a message
that appeal to every heart .
we have seen
it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat :
love pure and joy within the music of a choir
that is simple ,
yet full of power
once everyone finds his or her inner tone .
from the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth 
now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage 
daniel wants to start listening
and is drawn into the life of the simple 
warm and rough person of the north.he wins the heart with music
and gain the capacity to love
and be loved unconditionally.do not go see
it
if you have been normed to hollywood .
this stuff contains no extras ,
just your laughter 
your compassion 
your tear !
