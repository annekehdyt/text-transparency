i watched this movie
when i was a young lad full of raging hormone
and it was about as sexy a movie
as i had ever seen-or
ever was to see .
it may not have been a great movie .
my guess is it was not .
i do not really remember much about it ,
to tell you the truth .
i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn .
no woman in any movie has ever done it for me
as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie .
i have not seen it
since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i do not think
i would want to see it again
since i am sure
it would be a disappointment-my hormone
are not as raging
and i have become more jaded over the year .
still ,
when i think
back on the shower scene i can still remember
how great it felt way back when.added later :
after watching the movie again ,
i discovered
that it is dangerous to go home again .
what was once erotic is now pretty tame .
the older woman-younger man thing still works for me ,
just not as much
as it once did ,
probably because i am no longer a 12-year-old .
that older woman is now younger than i am .
also 
the amateurishness of the whole thing was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind .
moral :
sometime it is better not to revisit the past .
