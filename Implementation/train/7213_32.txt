a romance
without feeling 
a drama of issue
without point
( or drama ) ... .
this film is supposed to be all these and fail on each and every account ,
as if it is not trying .
or as if the director/editor/scriptwriter team is not really trying .
the actor are able
-- they need better support.one element
that does not fail is the score by george delarue .
beautiful and moving .
what a shame it is attached to this film .
in a good film actor ' word and movement and music synchronize and enhance the impact .
this editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement .
the love scene is particularly grating in this respect :
an insult to the talent of the lead actor.there is another element in the film
that works :
location photography .
notably one moment in grand central station .
i would guessed in advance what was going to happen ;
but how it was filmed in that setting was eathtaking.some commentator on this board have pointed out
that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientist actually happened during these year of the maccarthy scare .
the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society ,
it switches into conventional romance ;
before any human feeling can move us ,
it is away on a ( predictable )
'thriller ' escapade.just as the film insults the talent of the actor ,
it insults the issue
it is pretend
( and fail )
to take up.you are warned .
