i watched this on an 8 hour flight
and
( presumably because of the pressure and the altitude )
i actually found
it mildly entertaining
( emphasis on the `` mild '' )
.the actual idea behind the film was illiant :
a woman dies 
her fianc\u00e9 falls in love with someone else 
she decided to make sure
they do not get together ,
but eventually she lets them do it .
sadly the actual film was not as good .
ok 
there were a few laugh
and the actor all worked well .
but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable
as the destination of the flight i was on .
i think
the whole gay-but-not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better .
the talking parrot was a nice idea
but to be honest :
it was not really very funny.in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me ,
but it was a close call .
