i can not understand why so many people praised this show .
twin peak is one of the most boring title i
have ever seen in my life.now i have seen all season 1 episode ,
and seeing season 2 episode 1. simply i can not take this show anymore.1 )
where is the proper induction in criminal investigation ? in season 1 ,
there was a scene
that agent cooper throw stone to a bottle .
can you guess why he did that ?
he just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke '
while mentioning supernatural ability
given by tibet dream .
wow ! !
! 2 ) there are too many unnecessary scene in this show.for example ,
season 2 started with a 'funny ' scene
that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor .
( he got the gun shoot in his belly already . )
this old man is doing nothing
but saying some dumb comment .
that is all.this scene is really boring and even long
( 3 min 30 sec ... .
it is like hell .
) i would read some comic book rather than see this show anymore .
