the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his follower
so
that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb .
the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace
until he himself resembles a mummy .
one by one 
the blood is drained from those
involved in the dig.to
be as ief as possible ,
pharaoh 's curse is quite the lackluster affair .
while the movie does present a few good ,
original idea
( blood sucking mummy 's 
soul transference 
interesting make-up effect 
the arm ripping scene 
etc . )
and a few atmospheric moment 
the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding .
to make matter even worse ,
the first 15 of the film 's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding .
i usually go for these slow moving mummy movie ,
but pharaoh 's curse test even my patient .
the cast helps very little .
with only one exception
( ziva rodann is the lone ight spot \u0096 wish
the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character ) ,
the cast is as dull as the screenplay .
finally 
i do not know
whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas ,
but it is a laughable ,
ridiculous look for a creature
that supposed to instill fear in the audience.despite my mostly negative comment on the pharaoh 's curse ,
i am going to rate it a 4/10 .
not a good rating
to be sure ,
but generous
given all the problem i
have with the movie .
