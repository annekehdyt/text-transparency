this is one of the worst thing
to ever come out of england ,
so that says a lot right there .
the tension
when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though .
the upside is seeing the nice secretary 
sheila 
in her picnic table print underwear for awhile
after being captured by dr. rat face .
this movie has several view of london too
although none of them are good .
there is also a point
in which there is almost a car accident
which gets your heart rate back to just below normal .
there is also a watch
that gets teleported away ,
and the fear of the woman
not getting her watch back
is parallel to the horror of `` the sixth sense ''
only a lot more dull and british .
add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr. rat ,
which result in nothing ,
plus the electrocuting of a lot of person 
plus a cat
and you have yourself ... ummm ... a british movie .
the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there best .
