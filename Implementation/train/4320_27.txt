so let me start off by saying
that i saw this movie as part of a bargain .
i was really bored one fine 1997 day
and so i biked over to the movie rental store .
i asked the clerk what the worst movie
he had in stock
was .
without hesitation he walked me over to `` lucky stiff . ''
he told me
that he had waive the $ 1 rental fee
( he said
it would be wrong to charge more )
if i promised to watch the whole movie .
so watch it i did ,
for free ... this movie is terrible .
god-awful even .
i do not need to go into plot detail ,
read the other review .
the joke make no sense .
the acting was terrible .
i know
it was supposed to be a comedy ,
but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting .
you might try to watch it as something to laugh at ,
but it is so bad
that it is not even funny in that way .
avoid !
