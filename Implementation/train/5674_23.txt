falsely accused ,
skirt-chasing chum john wayne
( as john scott )
and eddy chandler
( as kansas charlie )
change identity to become `` alias smith and jone '' .
mr. wayne becomes `` john jone '' .
mr. chandler 's is supposed to be `` rev .
smith '' 
but wayne calls him `` dr. smith '' .
at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis 
pete duel 
jonathan harris 
or ben murphy ; although ,
wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them 
career wise .
pretty blonde mary kornman
( as anne ) ,
grown-up from her day in `` our gang '' ,
is a lovely interest for wayne .
she and chandler have a couple of cute scene with wayne .
if you are not a fan of low budget john wayne film of the 1930s ,
this movie will not make you one .
