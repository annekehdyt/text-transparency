robert de niro 
cuba gooding jr. 
hal holook 
and all the rest of the actor and actress in `` man of honour '' have combined
to make this a fine movie .
mark isham wrote the filmscore ,
so you know
the music is truly fine 
too.but :
after noticing a slew of goofs 
loophole 
and over-dramatic heart-string plucking right from the start ,
i had to make a vow
to ignore them
and sit back
to enjoy the film .
if you can do that ,
it _really_is_ good.the story of carl brashear 
a true-to-life hero 
is inspirational enough to last a lifetime .
look him up on the internet ...
the entire story is more amazing than the film ,
as the director admitted in his commants .
there were only three african-american u.s. navy diver in world war ii .
however 
none reached the status of u.s. navy master diver .
carl brashear was the first african-american u.s. navy master diver .
and he was the first amputee diver
to ever be certified or recertified as a u.s. navy diver .
( resounding applause )
.on the negative side of the movie 's ledger :
should i tell you of only one of the many `` loophole '' ?
yeah 
i will mark this commant as containing `` spoiler ''
and do so ... the early 
pivotal scene
where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sink into the sea :
they had never have had the time
to suit up a full mark v diver ,
even if he were the legendary master chief billy sunday 
in time
to be only `` ... a couple of minute late '' saving the pilot.so 
for loophole 
goofs 
and over-dramatization 
i derated `` man of honor '' from a perfect 10 down to a 7.will hollywood ever realize
that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling ?
i doubt it .
too bad !
