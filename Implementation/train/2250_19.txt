the movie had a lot of potential 
unfortunately ,
it came apart
because of a weak/implausible story line 
miscasting 
and general lack of content/substance .
one of the very obvious flaw was that sean connery ,
who played an arab man ,
did not know how to pronounce his own arab name !
this may seem a small flaw
but it points to the seeming lack of effort
in paying attention to detail .
the quality of acting was uniformly well below average .
movie 's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end ;
and a french song
( i do not recall the title ) .
overall 
it was a pretty bad movie
where sean connery was visibly miscast .
