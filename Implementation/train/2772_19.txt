remembering the dirty particular of this insidiously vapid `` movie '' is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty 
salted spoon .
perhaps `` home alone 2 :
lost in new york ''
( 1992 )
was a bit on the predictable side ,
but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bid at commercialization i have ever heard of .
a boy fighting off spies/terrorist
when he is home
alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox ?
ridiculous !
why did this film have to be made ?
i am the kind of person
who believes
even terrible movie are not waste of time 
but rather learning experience .
however 
this is actually a waste of time .
it should be avoided at all cost .
