i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater
( where i used to attend `` kiddie matin\u00e9e '' s almost every saturday )
in dayton 
ohio
when i was a young boy
and have never forgotten it .
it simply amazed me and my friend .
i do wish
there were some way i could see it again !
i have tried to find some compilation of short or something like that to no avail .
i only recently discovered
that it was a cousteau film
and that blew my mind even more .
how the heck he accomplished this
is beyond my understanding .
the fish is actually in the cat 's mouth at one point ,
if i remember correctly !
if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful !
