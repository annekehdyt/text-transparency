gritty 
dusty western from director richard brooks ,
who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre
while keeping all the usual clich\u00e9s intact .
early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy
( gene hackman ) ,
a suave gambler
( jame coburn ) ,
a cocky kid
( jan michael vincent ) ,
and even a female
( a surprisingly game candice bergen ) .
once the preliminary are out of the way
( with the predictable argument
over whether or not a woman should take part ) ,
this becomes a fairly engrossing entry 
though one
which eaks no new ground
( it instead resembles something from gary cooper 's era ) .
good-looking ,
if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast ,
yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly .
