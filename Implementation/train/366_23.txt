in this installment of the series 
edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain
( during the later portion of george iii 's rule ) .
this time 
blackadder 's prospect are much poorer
-- as instead of royalty ,
he is a servant to the very 
very thick george iv
( the price regent ) .
unlike the historical account of george iv 
this one is about as ight as a tomato and as a result ,
blackadder 's able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart 's content .
the only major difference in style between this one and earlier one is
that the series ends on a very 
very 
very different note
-- you just have to see it to believe it .
other than that 
all the usual story element are there
and the show is hilarious .
the only reservation i have
( as always )
is that this show is not appropriate for the kid due to its crude language and adult situation .
