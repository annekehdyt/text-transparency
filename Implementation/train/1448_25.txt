dear me .
where do i start ?
the dad is not anywhere near old enough
to be the girl 's dad .
he corpses on camera in the first 5 minute of the film .
the favoured exclamation in this film is `` jesus christ ! ! ! `` .
zombie are agile 
stupid and few and far between .
motive are utterly incomprehensible
and a narrative does not exist .
person 'rush ' to their destination in jeep driven at 3 mph .
the world seems to be carrying on as normal
yet these are supposed to be the end day .
breast appear for the sake of east .
normally such an approach would provide some redemption
but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in east or the future of humanity .
there is a dog for no reason and thin 
orange blood
that turns the stomach .
the general and his catchphrase of `` shut the f**k up ! ''
is the only redeeming feature .
as for the rest 
i sincerely hope to hear
that they had done the decent thing
and killed themselves .
