i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine .
i did not know what to expect ,
i would not read much about it
as i knew i would see it no matter what .
all in all 
it is very well done .
it does not focus on the generalization of `` anti-war '' statement ,
which to me ,
left the politic out of it .
the soldier mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp ,
and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life .
it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war ,
but refusing the command
to go back
when it was against personal moral .
make no mistake
- this is not an anti-war film .
anyone who says
it is has not seen it or is not living with the scar of war on their soul .
