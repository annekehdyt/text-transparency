i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say
is ... '' what did i just watch ? ? ? ? ''
and i mean
that in a good and bad way.the plot is really simple .
stiller and black play friend/neighbor .
stiller is the focused ,
hardworker while black is a dreamer .
black invent this idea to create a spray
that erases poo .
the idea become very popular ,
and black become very rich .
the extravagant lifestyle
that black gain and the fact
that he still tries to be best friend with stiller cause stiller
to become crazy with envy.as i said ,
the plot is simple .
everything else is plain odd .
the direction is odd 
with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere
sped up sequence .
the dialouge and the acting is very odd ;
odd in a rambling sort of way .
and the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie 
from the weird `` envy '' song
that keeps on reappearing to the scene
where you think
you are going to hear a classic 80 's song
but suddenly it is in japanese.so ,
the true question is this ...
is odd funny ?
that depends purely on the individual .
i was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie .
after the screening i heard person call it horribly unfunny and glad
that it was free .
strangely 
i understood their point .
there are no joke whatsoever ,
so if you are not hooked by the uniqueness of it all ,
you will hate this movie .
absolutely hate
it.this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office
and become a dvd cult classic .
if you can laugh at a movie with no real joke ,
like cable guy or punch drunk love ,
then i suggest you see it .
if you do not ,
run away from this movie .
it will only make you mad .
