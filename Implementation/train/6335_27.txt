the reviewer from poland must be a feminist ,
for she finds `` young catherine '' to be a great film and historically accurate .
nothing could be further from the truth .
as a practicing russian historian for many ,
many year i took exception with yc at almost every turn ,
and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss
who single-handed
moved russia into a direction of dominance .
the truth ?
she was only ought to st.petersburg to be a wife and mother ,
and found
she had to `` bond '' with the dvoriane 
the boyar ,
and the military just to survive .
so long as she did not challenge them
she was able/ permitted to indulge her cultural wish
( filling up the hermitage with art treasure 
etc . ) .
there are so many proofs
that she was not `` great 
''
but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular .
yc is only a costume drama 
a bit of fluff from ted turner
that 
like `` peter the great '' in 1986 
is one more example of how badly russia is portrayed in the west .
