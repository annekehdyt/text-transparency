being a filmmaker myself ,
and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour ,
i thought
i was in for a treat
when i took home `` my wrong ... ''
( not that the dvd cover gives anything away ,
instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director 
chris morris 
`` a short film
including scene '' ) .
i should have known better really ,
and avoided this insipid
( and often offensive )
piece of twoddle.the scene in the church is repulsive to watch
( especially since we are all too familiar with morris 's warped attitude toward paedophilia from his notorious tv series 
brass eye )
and serves no purpose other than to shock .
how this film is labelled a comedy i
will never understand.the runner 's commentary sound like a novel idea in principle
( having been a runner myself ,
it is often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process ) ,
however this is sadly not the case here .
instead 
we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dog on film ,
before concluding
that there are no really great movie starring dog .
this is all very interesting ,
but not worth a single frame of celluloid.to say
that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement .
it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style 
at the expense of plot 
character and dialogue ,
leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled .
its over-simplified message -
that man should take responsibility for his action -
is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.the film does have its moment of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism 
but ultimately ,
it fails to convince ,
to entertain 
to enlighten
and just ends up being irritating .
if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking ,
i strongly recommend `` franz kafka 's it is a wonderful life '' 
by peter capaldi .
