if you only read a synopsis of the plot ,
this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930 's .
the story would seem quite contrived 
the subject matter maudlin .
the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct ,
earthy performance of the cast.i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling 
rich and subtle nuance float over her face .
if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel ,
there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal character .
the raw emotion are so sincerely portrayed 
so true .
the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant :
when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son ,
lifts him up
and proudly says ,
`` my kid !
`` 
i could not help remember
that mr. gable 's own son was born to him posthumously .
this is one of the finest example of depression era cinema .
