i watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarity between 3 lb and house ,
m.d.. tucci 's character is illiant but socially inept out of choice 
similar to laurie 's character house ,
but without the acerbic wit
that laurie ings to house .
meanwhile 
tucci 's 'straight guy ' 
the emphatic doctor seger 
is not developed into a more interesting character 
like the fallible 'straight guy ' cuddy and wilson .
indira varma 's character adrienne holland is too similar to jennifer morrison 's doctor cameron
to be a co-incidence.someone at cbs
obviously noticed the success of house 
m.d .
and told his staff to get him
( her ) a similar show ,
hoping
that mimicry would prove successful .
however 
copying a show like house demands
the same high level balance of wit and suspense and tucci and company are just not up to the challenge.i did not know
the show was canceled until i read the comment on imdb ,
but it does not come as a surprise to me .
