jackie chan name is synonomus to stunt .
this movie never let you down.the
opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,
if he knows
the meaning of fear.this movie comes very close to jackie 's best
which is project a.but the main difference
being
that project a contain three star
where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.this
is perhaps the main reason
that this movie made jackie an biggest martial art star
followed by bruce lee.the film
has nice comic touch too .
what makes this film work is jakie 's ability
to show his venerable side
which his in contract to the typical martial art action hero.this movie was followed by a sequel
which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor .
