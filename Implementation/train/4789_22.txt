this is one of the most amazing story i
have ever seen .
if this film had been directed by larry clark ,
then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eye of the killer and whatever led
that person to go insane in the first place.instead ,
the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting ,
and how it effected the victim
who survived.i had seen busy phillip in other film before ,
but her performance in this movie is by far 
her best .
the only other movie
that i have seen with erika christensen
is `` swim fan ''
which made me almost not want to watch this film ,
but she turned in a very good performance herself.this is one of the few movie i
have seen
that was actually able to make me cry .
trust me
when i tell you ,
that does not happen very often.home room
is a beautiful film ,
and that is all there is too it ...
