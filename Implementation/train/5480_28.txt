may the saint preserve us ,
because this movie is not going to help.someone with access need to e-mail mel gibson
and tell him
we need a faithful production of beowulf .
something
that actually has something in common with the epic poem
that is the foundation for all modern western literature.the recent
( since 2000 )
version of beowulf make we wonder two thing .
first 
why is there so much interest in the story .
second 
why are all these filmmaker squandering mountain of cash on this crap.the
only reason
this got a two is that the version with lambert in it
( beowulf 2000 )
was worse
and needed the 1.what is even worse ,
some person will watch this
and get the wrong idea about the poem .
how can an industry
where peter jackson gets a literary conversion to film
so right can get it so wrong .
i mean really ,
the roman forum as a model for heorot is too much.and please ,
horns on helmet ?
spare me .
this is insulting./hjm
