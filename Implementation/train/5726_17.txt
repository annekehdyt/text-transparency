as with many other pop-culture franchise series 
this line just did not know when to quit .
instead of leaving thing
as they were perfectly ended ,
they went on to generate this ;
the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark.this movie should never have happened .
it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line ,
and it sure shows .
the premise is idiotic
and the portrayal were the same.after the wonderful experience
which was the oman ,
this was a major disappointment
which stank of 70 's cheese and horrible acting .
it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspect ,
and left a terrible 
lingering stench long after it was over .
it rate a 1.4/10 from ... the fiend : .
