dick tracy was not the best for many comic book fan ,
because they wanted something with blood like batman .
dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villain
that have severe appearance disorder
and being fun .
warren beatty direct and star as the main character
that fights crime
without even using super power .
i have liked dick tracy
since i was a child
because of the comic atmosphere of the main color :
red 
blue 
orange 
yellow 
green and black .
this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their child .
al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with zest .
madonna as the babe
who is the second villain in this film does
not play the same boy toy
she represents .
like i said 
no blood 
obscenity 
sexually innuendo or anything
to offend anybody .
