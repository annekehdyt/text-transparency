typical thriller 
has been done many time before .
simple plot outline ;
cop liotta become obsessed with russell 's wife ,
and he tries to bump off good ol ' kurt
so he can have her .
this is beyond predictable ,
it does not even try to make you guess ,
the plot is the plot
and there is no thinking outside the box here .
i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops ,
but nothing is done originally or interestingly .
there is not really anything to say about this film ,
it is not particularly bad ,
but there is no good point either .
russell play russell
and you know
what you are gon na get
when you see him in a film .
ditto liotta .
stowe has an annoying cher-esque voice .
i read the plot outline
and i could see the film in my head ,
it was so obvious and basic .
i watched it
and it rolled out in front of my eye
exactly as i had imagined .
i felt not a drop of emotion throughout .
i have no feeling towards this film ,
it is as if i never even watched it .
considering this ,
it is a pretty pointless film is not it ?
still 
i will give it 3/10 for some reason .
