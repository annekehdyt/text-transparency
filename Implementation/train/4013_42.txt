you know
when you are on the bus
and someone decide to tell you their life-story ,
and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face
when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off ?
well i had a similar sensation
while watching this film .
okay 
i did actually choose to go and see aprile ,
and i knew about nanni moretti 's taste
for making himself the one and only star from caro diario ,
but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slap .
caro diario was funny 
unusual ,
and at least a couple of other character managed to get a word in edgeway .
in aprile 
however 
moretti has exclusive right to the dialogue ,
so
that all you hear for an hour
and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politic are best ,
or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment .
he also finds time to slag off film
that he does not like ,
something i thought was reserved for loser like me .
surely being in a position
like his you would think
he had try
and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this .
by making a proper film perhaps 
one with some idea and a decent structure 
or maybe one
that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice .
and when he started fawning over his newborn baby ,
i just wanted to go
and be in the company of someone normal 
preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music .
the next time someone
you do not know
try to tell you their life-story ,
give them a slap from me .
every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism .
