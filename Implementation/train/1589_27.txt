the idea was awesome ,
the actor were incredible ,
the story could of been very scary ,
but the writing was poor
and there was no depth .
i could not really get into this movie .
i could not feel for the character ,
there were a lot of cliffhanger ,
and the movie just ends very weirdly .
was it a happy ending ?
i do not know .
was it a sad ending ?
again 
i do not know .
you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied .
the movie had so much to give ,
but could not .
just because you can edit ,
does not mean you should 
right ?
i would not really recommend this movie
because you just can not say
that you left the movie feeling like it was completed .
you will just be confused .
trust me 
you will probably thank me
if you do not watch this movie.3/10
