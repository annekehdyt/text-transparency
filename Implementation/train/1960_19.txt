this game is the bomb
and this is the 007 game of the year
and should be on greatest hit .
when i got agent under fire ,
i thought
that was a good game
but then nightfire came around
and that was better ,
but now there is a new type of jame bond game .
this time it a 3rd person shooter
and there is more than 12 mission ,
the graphic of the game are out of this house .
it even has all of the great actor and actress in this game like pierce bronsan as once again jame bond 
william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo 
and judi dench as m
( forgive me all
if i spell it wrong ) .
this game would be own
as the greatest jame bond game around.i give this a 10/10
