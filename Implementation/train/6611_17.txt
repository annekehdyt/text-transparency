i love this movie 
jouvet 
arletty 
blier 
carn\u00e9 ...
almost everything has already been said about the movie ,
but there is one detail i would like to shed some light onto :
no footage of the real 
still standing 
h\u00f4tel du nord
( is it still ?
i heard
it was to be demolished ... )
has been used for the movie -
the whole scene has been rebuilt on set 
the main reason
being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several week .
