another horror flick
in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick
who want to take over ? !
yes 
but the fact
that this one was from canada gives
it a slightly different feel .
`` the brain '' has troublesome
teenager jim majelewski getting put into a treatment
whose leader turns out to be a cult leader
aided by a big ugly `` ain '' .
can jim stop him ?
i guess
that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all
that they have accomplished ,
they are entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie .
but still 
they will probably want to be known
for having national health care and all.the bad guy had a ain .
why did not the person
who made this movie ?
