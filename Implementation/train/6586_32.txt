made in 1946
and released in 1948 ,
the lady and shanghai was one of the big film
made by welle
after returning from relative exile for making citizen kane .
dark 
ooding and expressing some early cold war paranoia 
this film stands tall as a film-noir crime film .
the cinematography of this film is filled with welle ' characteristic quirk of odd angle 
quick cut 
long pan and sinister lighting .
the use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in touch of evil ,
and the mysterious chinese character and the sequence in chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration 
in many way 
to roman polanski 's chinatown .
unfortunately 
it is welle ' obsession with technical filmmaking
that hurts this film in its entirety .
the plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques.however ,
despite this criticism ,
the story combined with wonderful performance by welle 
hayworth and especially glenn ander
( laughter )
make this film a joy to watch .
orson welle pull off not only the irish ogue ,
but the torn identity as the honest but dangerous sailor .
rita hayworth ,
who was married to welle at the time ,
eaks with her usual role as a sex goddess
and takes on a role of real depth and contradiction .
finally 
glenn ander strange and bizarre portrayal or elsa 's husband ' law partner is nothing short of classic !
