yes there are great performance here .
unfortunately 
they happen in the context of a movie
that does not seem to have a clue what
it is doing .
during the first 45-60 minute of this all the music takes place as realistic performance .
suddenly 
about an hour in 
the character
who 
until this point ,
had always spoken to each other ,
suddenly start singing to each other .
to further confuse thing ,
a little further in 
out of nowhere 
they actually do about 15 minute of sung-through dialog ,
then seem to drop that idea and move on to other thing 
such as a number
that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitar suddenly
turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section .
on top of all this inconsistency
in how the music is used ,
is the composer ' clear inability
to actually write music in the style
that is supposedly being portrayed .
while the first couple of piece do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound ,
the rest of the film is just
( bad )
broadway show music .
then there is the pure silliness of snippet of a group
doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to jame brown to lionel richie .
when he started channeling stevie wonder i could not help laughing out loud .
this was clearly one of those film
that make me appreciate
how little time i have on earth and resent
that i wasted two hour of it watching this film .
