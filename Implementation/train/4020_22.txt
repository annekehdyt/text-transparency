this game is amazing .
really 
you should get it
if you do not have it .
although it is ancient now
it was amazing
when it came out .
i believe
that this game will always be a classic .
it is just as good a super mario world or so .
when i was young ,
my friend and i would sit and play this game for hour
trying to beat it
which we eventually did .
it is not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy ,
but if you are a fellow mario fan
it is essential .
it is fun entertaining and challenging .
everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphic ,
( well it did come out in 1996 . )
rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi ! ! !
nintendo is the best !
