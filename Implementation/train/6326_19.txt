endearing tale ... ... .. voted ten against all average for my age and sex ...
not all that much comedy
( compared to a i almost wet myself movie )
although funny enough .
not a fan of musical at all so probably a little too much for me ,
but they do give you time
to grab a drink or soda
without missing anything important .
maybe a fifty version of when harry met sally ?
ahab no not really
but
if that is in your top ten like
it is mine you will like this movie .
really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling ,
reminding you of what romance could
and should be like ,
something to shoot for .
my summary describe it best in very few word ...
.. quite charming
