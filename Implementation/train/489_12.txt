despite the occasionally stilted acting and `` seen-it-all-before '' story ,
this is a fairly compelling movie.it has suspense ,
the scene with the demon are actually pretty creepy 
some of the visual effect are superb and best of all 
no ridiculously ill placed humour
to detract from the film ,
as too many
( wannabe )
horror film have in them nowhonestly ,
this is not the greatest film ever made ,
but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmenti was glad i
watched it
