dynasty revisited in hawaii ... full of clich\u00e9s 
highly predictable 
unrealistic and sometimes even stupid .
if you have nothing better to do however ,
it does provide 40 minute of simple 
unpretensive entertainment ,
endless look at great male and female muscle and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery .
on the other hand ,
if you are looking for anything more than that ,
stay away ... oh ,
and by the way ,
if you have ever worked in a hotel
or know anything about running one ,
you have two option :
1. you will feel sick every two minute at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or 
2. look at it as science fiction comedy as i did 
lie back 
relax ,
and laugh about it !
