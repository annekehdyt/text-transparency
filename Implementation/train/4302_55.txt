why else would he do this to me ?
not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movie .
or even decent movie .
i saw lois and clark ,
i am aware of just how ... `` good '' dean cain is.obviously this is gon na be a cheesey flick ,
and each cheesey flick has its own special way
to make you scratch your head .
i will not call these spoiler
as you can not really spoil this movie any more
than it already is.to begin with ...
why is that a fake helicopter ?
i mean ... why ? how come that one scientist is from chicago
and that other scientist is from la
and neither one could be any more eastern european
if they tried ?
how hard would it have been to get either an american actor 
or just change
that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say
those person are not american ?
why are there 2 occasion
when the movie gives us a slug line ?
we get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on .
and then that is it ,
who cares about the timeline .
to be honest ,
who cared about it
even when they mentioned it ,
but i guess
that is beside the point.do a movie really get better
if you are able to view it through multiple split screen ?
the answer is no.that dragon
sure can walk down
that hall..over..and over ... and over ... .and over ...
who on earth
was responsible for one of the worst ending in film history ?
it was straight out of scooby doo .
oh 
the dragon 's dead now ... say ,
wan na get dinner ?
sure 
but not at some chinese place ... .with dragon in the name ! !
ah ha ha ha ! !
ha ha ha ! !
haha ha !
i used to be superman !
aha ha ha !
ha ha ! fade to blackmy god 
it made me cringe
it was so stupid.but never fear..even
though the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive..for some reason
there is a second untouched 
unmanned lab
that survived pretty well ,
so they can make a sequel .
hurray for us all .
