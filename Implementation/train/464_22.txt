true fan of film will love this authentic movie.i disagree with the troll
who are rating this movie a one-star
and calling it unrealistic .
while i do not have the background or come from the environment of the protagonist ,
i have spent many year working in lower income and working class neighborhood
and feel
the acting was very real and representative of how teenager behave .
i do not know
what the basis is for other ' comment
that the film is `` unrealistic '' .
the dialog is great.the low budget production value
did not bother me a bit .
i felt
that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film .
the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama.i completely bought into the character 's motivation and reaction .
the acting was believable
and impressive for new and non-actors.if your idea of good film is transformer or fast and furious ,
then skip it .
if you enjoy good character driven dramas ,
then see it .
( regarding the negative commenter being `` troll '' :
click on their name and you will see most have no other review or only negative review . )
