good movie 
good music 
good background and an acceptable plot .
but the main point again
as his movie tend to be ,
the man is the best actor in idia
and can turn dust into gold .
nana patekar .
this may be his second best performance after parinda
( other may disagree ) .
although other movie are not far behind .
one man
that will never ever disappoint you.good movie
although i think
shahrukh was a luxury this movie
could have done without .
you can see in his movie ,
other try very hard to reach his height and act out of their skin .
but this man is really something
elase.the movie is cool ,
the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin
but the screen play and dialog again very good .
a must watch .
