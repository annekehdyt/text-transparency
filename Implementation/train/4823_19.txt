this is a very entertaining film
which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth .
although it has a lot to say about power 
jealousy and ambition
( the theme of macbeth )
in our modern world 
the film works best
when it is not taking itself too seriously .
recognizable actor such as john glover 
gloria reuben and david lansbury do nice job in the main role ,
but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene
where the `` murder '' of banquo
( john elsen )
is rehearsed .
probably a more entertaining film for those
involved in theatre ,
but anyone
who enjoys shakespeare
should enjoy this film .
