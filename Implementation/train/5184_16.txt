despite some moment in heavy rain 
an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey 
and a stay in a sanitarium 
this roscoe `` fatty '' arbuckle silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st. john is only fitfully amusing
though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster
that is the ultimate in `` meet cute '' scene
especially since it is one of the few time
we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movie !
also 
many scene seem to have been jump cut edited possibly
because of overuse of the film stock .
still ,
if you are an arbuckle or keaton completist ,
good night 
nurse !
is certainly worth a look .
