this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time .
not only is it revolutionary in its narration ,
but its also among the first movie
to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedian .
felix herngren and fredrik lindstr\u00f6m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmaker in sweden today ,
and this film really puts that on display .
`` vuxna m\u00e4nniskor ''
( adult person )
is a warm-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood ,
and the question
if we wouldn\u00b4t be better off
without it .
