three horror story based on member of a transgressive hindu cult
that return home
but changed in some way .
in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum
and is visited by a reported
who wants to find out
about what went on at the cult .
somewhat slow going as story is told in flashback
while the two sit on chair and face each other .
reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participant .
what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story .
thing get quite bloody.second story
has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy .
the patient seems to have some type of agenda
but the psychiatrist is up to the task .
again 
thing slow down a bit and get weird .
then there is a strange twist in the story
that is very well written and surprising.final story deal with spiritual healer
who claims to be able to remove the person illness from them with his hand .
one of the patient is a former cult member ,
so the successful healing gets more complicated .
again 
we are surprised by a twist .
has a pretty gory scene in there.there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason .
i found the story
to be very well
written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath.note :
review of the german dvd .
