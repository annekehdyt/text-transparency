one of b- and c-movie producer roger corman 's greatest cult classic was the ramone vehicle
( originally designated for cheap trick ) ,
rock n ' roll high school .
it is just a simple 
technically dated story
( but would serve up extra dose of nostalgia humor
considering these were the kind of thing
that made napoleon dynamite character funny
-- see eaglebauer 's van )
about teenager
who love rock n ' roll.student at vince lombardi high school
are met with resistance by the evil principal ,
miss evelyn togar
( played by cult classic favorite 
mary woronov )
who fears
that rock n ' roll turns kid into uncontrollable 
amoral deviant and vow
to make a rock n ' roll-free zone .
actually 
she intends to wipe out rock n ' roll for all student ,
regardless of whether its at school ,
and she has the cooperation of most of the adult
who might make the plan successful.but
not if riff randell
( pj sole )
can help it .
a ramone fanatic 
she has written some song
( including rock n ' roll high school )
that she wants to give to the ramone ,
and in trying to do so ,
is rebuffed by miss togar
who does all she can to keep her from going
to see the ramone play in town .
it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adult and the teenager
( in an ending
that is reminiscent of over the edge 
somewhat ) .
after the year of punk ,
when the fame of garage rocker 
the ramone
( and other )
would mark another shift in music evolution ,
it was great to see a movie
that celeated the fun of it all and in such a humorous ,
exaggerated way.it is mostly mild comedy ,
but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless
when you are in the mood for something more laid back
to entertain you .
with jerry zucker
( of airplane fame )
and joe dante
( of gremlin fame )
both taking part in some of the directing ,
you can get the idea
for what kind of humor you are in for ( and not to mention ,
expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minute in the film 's finale ) .
the story must 've later inspired
( and was consequently updated )
by the mid-90s comedy 
detroit rock city ,
which some minor character change in the vehicle for aged glam rocker ,
kizz.i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle 
rock n ' roll high school forever ,
released nearly a decade later .
the original is still the best .
