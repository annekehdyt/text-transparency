`` yokai daisenso '' is a child 's film by takashi miike ,
but
as you might expect ,
it is probably a bit too dark and scary for younger one .
however 
older child may well eat this up ,
that is ,
if you play it dubbed in english.the story
is that of a young boy ,
who has moved with his mother to the country ,
to live with his grandfather 
after a divorce .
during a village festival the boy is chosen as a `` kirin rider '' 
a great honor ,
but with that honor comes much danger and adventure 
of course.meanwhile ,
evil doing are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt 
go-go boot and a beehive hair-do ,
teams up with an evil yokai
to turn person 's resentment
and discarded item against them .
and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster
that head for the city of rage itself 
tokyo .
one quite funny scene has two derelict
watching the monster fly over the city ...
says
one 
`` oh 
it is only gamera '' .
the young boy has befriended yokai ,
which are monster of a kind 
mostly benign ,
that have isolated themselves away from human ,
and all the yokai in japan band together
to fight the evil.in many way
miike and crew have taken the late 60's/early 70 's yokai film
and turned them into a modern action adventure film for ( older )
kid
that also combines some strange mechanical monster
that made me think of `` transformer '' .
the look
and feel of the film is great ,
the effect are entertaining ,
and some of the humor will just sail right over kid 's head 
but still ,
older one might enjoy it .
as for adult 
there is not much here not to like ,
if you are a fan of japanese monster movie
you will enjoy the heck out of this.cool and fun stuff 
kind of dark at time
but perhaps that is just miike..and what a wild ride .
8/10 .
