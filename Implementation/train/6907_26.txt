a blair witch-war movie
that is as much of a letdown
as bwitch
was !
the title says
it all ,
save your money and your time
and spend it on a good movie such as `` once upon a time in america '' ,
`` the shawshank redemption '' or `` enemy at the gate ''
( if you want to watch a great `` war '' movie )
etc.this movie ,
if it were a baseball team
and the major league were the pinnacle and single a was the rookie ,
then this movie was high school ball .
it was filmed
as if it were a high school drama club
filming with their daddy 's old camera .
sure they went into a hostile area
( to make a film )
but i do not call
that ave 
around here we call
that plain stupid !
this is a pass all the way !
now go watch it
and then you tell me what you think .
