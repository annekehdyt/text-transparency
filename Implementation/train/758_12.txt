i saw this movie
when it first came out .
it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival
and i voted for it for best picture.justine priestley is hot as the psychotic 
but complex amanda .
this is not your ordinary psycho movie .
lot of interesting and original slant on the genre .
sort of a `` fatal attraction '' for the younger
set with some great blue music
mixed in as the object of amanda 's affection is married to an up and coming blue singer
who has less time for her husband
as her career takes off .
