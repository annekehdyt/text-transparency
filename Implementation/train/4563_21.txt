this is a thriller with a good concept 
good acting 
good photography and good intention all around ,
but which is confused and disjointed in execution.garcia star as john berlin 
an l.a. forensic detective
who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there .
he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder
which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer
whom no one else believes in .
the known victim is theorized to be blind ,
which leads to a romance with a blind girl -
believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind.despite a basically intriguing story
there were too many quantum leap and plot hole in this movie
where i found myself wondering ,
'how the hell did we wind up here ? '
or 'how did we find this out ? '
i found it confusing and disjointed ,
despite the good acting 
etc .
john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f.b.i .
investigator out to get berlin.not recommended .
