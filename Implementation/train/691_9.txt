i can count
( on one hand )
the number of good movie starring joe don baker .
this is not one of them.interminable chase scene 
dim-witted dialogue ,
and terrible lapse in continuity made this movie a prime choice
for getting the send-up on mst3k.and
that is the only way
i was able to watch this ...
