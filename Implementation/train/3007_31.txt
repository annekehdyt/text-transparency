this movie is now my gauge
against which all other movie will be compared ... as in ,
`` was it as stupid as revolver ? ''
i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night
where a room
filled with over 2000 person
walked out in an eerie silence
after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hour of sheer nonsense .
jason stratham would have been amazing
if only he had a purpose .
within the first 10 minute he is given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy
( of soprano 's fame )
which makes no sense at all !
then there is some shooting
and then there is ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini ief ,
then there is some animation ,
ray liotta 's naked butt 
lot of shooting 
teeth gnashing 
art house wan na be pretension and more of liotta 's embarrassing body
that elicited laugh at every showing ...
which i am not quite sure was the reaction
he was looking for ... not 5 time anyway .
everyone in this movie thinks
they are smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks
he is yogi bear incarnate .
the story line might have went nowhere
but the posturing was outta sight !
the only way
this movie could have been worse
is if madonna herself was in it .
