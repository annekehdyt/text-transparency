anemic comedy-drama 
an unhappy 
seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a woebegone housewife
who slowly makes friend with the hit-man
who 's been hired
to kill her by her husband .
chazz palminteri 
as the talkative hired gun 
adapted the screenplay from his own play 
with stagy set-up and back-and-forth dialogue
that quickly tires the eye and ear .
an air of gloom hang over the entire project ,
and director paul mazursky can not get cher out of her perpetual funk
( she is listless ) .
despite all the top talent
( including robert de niro as one of the producer ) ,
`` faithful '' is fraudulent ,
with no substance to the story and character
who rarely come to life .
*1/2 from ****
