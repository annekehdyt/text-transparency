a super comedy series from the 1990s
( two series were made in total )
that suffered in the uk rating due to poor scheduling .
when you are up against established comedy like 'minder ' ,
even the best new comedy are going to struggle to get noticed.luckily ,
i caught the series from episode one
and followed it avidly .
i mentioned it to friend and family at the time ,
but everyone seemed to have been watching something else .
very 
very frustrating.anyway 
i loved both series
and never forgot
it.then i looked it up on the internet
and found
that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own'.well ,
both series are now available on dvd.http :
