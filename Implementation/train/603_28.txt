i love old burt reynold movie .
they are funnier and better than every other movie combined .
they might
as well have stopped making movie
after `` cannonball run 2 '' ,
but i guess how could they have known
that there were not going to be any more good one ?
man this movie 's good .
burt reynold has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot ,
and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand ,
looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way .
burt and loni 
those were the day !
i used to have this magazine
that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner .
i sure loved that advertisement !
plus there is this one part in the movie
where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace
( burty r. )
is doing ,
and it shows one guy in the audience bending over
and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment !
i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night !
if you can find this movie ,
rent it !
and then never watch another movie again ,
because i tell you right now :
there is no point .
