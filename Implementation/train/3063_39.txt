most 70s
( and 80s )
kong kong martial art film barely function as movie ;
usually there are a few well-planned fight sequence ,
but the plot is scraped pretty thin
to fill in the gap between those node
-- like porno film 
really.but this one does several thing well .
most overtly 
there is the direction and choreography ,
which confines each combatant to a 'style '
-- it is really based on chinese circus acrobatic and comedic theater ,
but the effect works.second 
there is the language of the camera ,
which uses some impressive technique
( even by today 's measure ) ,
changing projection speed from real time time to slow motion ,
and from unfiltered to filtered view to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future.least overt 
but most powerful and unexpected 
is the construction .
the winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfold ' the story .
the master
( the writer )
sets up a game
where the lead character does not know
who he is seeking ,
which is the same situation
we viewer find ourselves in .
one by one 
he figures out
who is who ,
at the same rate we find out
who is who .
it all follows a tragedy/noir arc .
the ending tend toward irony 
a la `` the sting '' .
much more clever stuff
than what we usually get out of this genre.the 'five venom '
idea is the template for tarantino 's 'deadly viper assassin ' from the `` kill bill '' volume .
