it is the nature of business
to try to capitalize on other ' success .
here we have a movie
taking element from the earlier 'dracula '
( 1931 )
and 'frankenstein '
( 1931 ) --
in a germanic town the village leader believe
that vampire
( in the shape of bat )
have been the cause of recent death of bloodless victim .
even though shot at universal
( and at the bronson caves ! )
it is a poverty row feature ;
it is not fair to compare it with those earlier 
more expensively made and superior film.from the familiar and exciting 
chilling music of the main title
( which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff ) ,
through the talky
but well done opening sequence ,
we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill 
fay wray and dwight frye
to give us a good 30s mystery film .
unfortunately 
it does not happen .
that is the disappointment.we get little more than the formulaic element of such film but with slow pacing 
low budget 
not enough of dwight frye 
the overdone presence of maude eburne
( aunt gussie ) ,
and the premise for lionel atwill
( dr. von niemann )
to require human blood
or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil
( robert frazier )
never made very clear.do not watch the technicolor 'dr .
x '
( 1932 ) --
which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter --
before watching this the way i did ;
it is an oscar winner by comparison .
so watch this one first .
structurally 
'the vampire bat ' still is not that good .
it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief ,
without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.beside 'dr .
x ' and 'mystery of the wax museum '
( both 1932 and co starring fay wray ) ,
lionel atwill 's most famous appearance are as the one armed gendarme in 'son of frankenstein '
( 1939 )
and as moriarity in 'sherlock holme and the secret weapon '
( 1943 ) .
dwight frye steal all his manic scene in 'dracula '
( 1931 ) .
as the 'young lover 
' melvin dougla and fay wray have a nice kissing scene ,
but that is about it .
he can be seen in 'the old dark house '
( 1932 ) ,
and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in 'the most dangerous game '
( 1930 ) .
then there is her 1933 classic 'screamer . '
too bad more time 
money and rewrite were not available for this film
to better showcase the talent and chemistry of lionel atwill 
fay wray and dwight frye .
sadly 
then 
this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 .
