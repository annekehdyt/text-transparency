what were they thinking at `` canne '' ?
one of the most irritating 
film of all time .
every detail of this film ,
no matter how meaningless was shown .
if i had to watch her put on those boot one more time i
think
i would have shouted .
if the point of this film was to show
how pathetic a life rosetta had ,
then it was covered within the first fifteen minute of the movie
and then the credit should have been running .
but no 
we had to see countless redundant scene over and over .
the whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic character .
they deserved the misery
that was rosetta .
and to think i passed up `` tumbleweed ''
to see this over-hyped film of boredom .
it was like watching grass grow ,
only that is more exciting .
