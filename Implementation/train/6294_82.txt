`` the thing about my folk '' came in as a surprise .
we had no idea about what to expect .
the film
directed by raymond defelitta ,
and based on a screen play by one of its star 
paul reiser ,
proved to be a pleasant time at the movie .
although the film is predictable
and we know
what will be the outcome ,
this is a voyage of discovery
where ben gets to know his father 
perhaps for the first time in his life 
ben sees his father for what he really is ,
and not the mythical figure
he has in his mind.the film seems to be a vehicle for its star 
peter falk ,
and he runs away with the movie ,
as it was expected .
mr. falk 
one of the most endearing actor
working in movie in this era and in past year ,
is an actor of such stature ,
he must be reckoned with .
as sam kleinman 
the distant father to ben 
he is a man
that clearly is misunderstood 
not only by ben ,
but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven year.when muriel 
the matriarch of the kleinman clan 
runs away ,
everyone goes into a panic
because this woman ,
who has been the strong figure of the family ,
is vital
to keep everyone together .
not knowing
where she has gone ,
sam shows up at ben 's house confused
as he feels abandoned 
suddenly 
by the woman he married
and has been faithful for all those year.ben ,
the youngest son 
takes his father on a trip
to look for a house
he wants to buy so
he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country .
the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in way
he never knew
about because the old man had alway projected an aloof figure to his younger son .
along the way 
father and son realize
how much they love one another
and how misunderstood the old man has been by his child .
the love of sam for muriel spans the many year they have known one another ;
they seem inseparable.peter falk is magnificent in the film .
he makes an excellent sam kleinman 
the man
who suddenly realizes his life
is about to change for the worst .
mr. falk shines as the older man
and there is never a false movement in his interpretation of the man
whose whole world is crumbling under him.not
being a paul reiser fan ,
we must confess
that as ben kleinman 
he is right .
ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel 
the mother
that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together .
olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film .
she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother .
elizabeth perkin plays rachel with great style..the film has a beautiful look thank to the cinematography of dan gillham 
and the excellent musical score by steven argila .
ultimately 
the film shows a great team effort between its director 
mr. defelitta and paul reiser
who wrote it for the screen.although this film
is clearly targeted for an older audience ,
it should please anyone .
