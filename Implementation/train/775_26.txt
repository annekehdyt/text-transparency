`` tapehead '' 
a scrappy 
intermittently funny spoof of the music video business 
might have been the perfect comedic short ,
and stars john cusack and tim robbin are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved .
they play two semi-savvy security guard in los angele
who start their own company 
video ace ,
making hilarious video for group 
party 
and one deathbed star .
it is too bad
the filmmaker had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time
( shenanigan
involving a crooked politician and his henchman
which does not do much except take away from the movie 's primary strength ,
sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s ) .
still 
cusack and robbin create a couple of original here :
nerdy but loose 
street-smart
without being hipster or poser ,
these guy are on the same nutty wavelength ,
and they never put each other down .
they are the real thing in buddy-comedy .
*1/2 from ****
