what a wasted cast.this is one of the most disappointing film i
have seen.usually roger ebert does not let me down ,
but i feel cheated
after seeing this movie.the only thrill is seeing elizabeth bank in her a.
that is a sorry statement about this movie .
it held so much promise ,
but it was like dry humping a transvestite.this is self absorbed tripe.i can not express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie ,
and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment .
