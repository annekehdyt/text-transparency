it is been nearly 30 year ,
and i still hate everyone
involved in this movie .
it remains the worst movie i have ever seen.before seeing this ,
i never much minded river 
one way or the other .
after seeing this movie ,
i have an allergic reaction
when i accidentally see her on television.i got dragged to this - against my better judgment
- by peer pressure .
however ,
coming out of the theater ,
those friend swore an oath
to never again overrule my choice of movie .
nearly thirty year later 
we still carry around mental scar from this movie.on my deathbed ,
one of my regret will be the time i wasted
hoping
that this movie might get better .
it never did.if you are ever given a choice ,
you would prefer putting your own eye out
to sitting
though this movie.i registered for imdb comment just in the hope
that perhaps i can warn other against viewing this movie .
if i can save just one person from watching this ,
then my existence on this earth will have been justified .
