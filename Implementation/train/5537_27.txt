contrary to what those
who hate christianity ,
the 700 club provides real answer as well as inspiration .
it also provides reliable news 
logical commentary and a different view than what abc 
cbs 
nbc and pbs think
is best .
unlike other program ,
which provide social and faith-related commentary 
those
who are behind the 700 club provide help for those in need 
such as feeding the hungry with operation blessing ,
providing medical help to those living in poverty-stricken community
and giving hope to those
who need hope .
it is not at all hateful .
if the 700 club offend you ,
i suggest reaching for the remote control
and turning the channel on your tv set .
i do the same thing
when i find cnn headline news or for that matter 
program
which i find biased or offensive .
what i find offensive is the way
that the abc family inserts the disclaimer
that the view of the 700 club do not reflect those of abc family .
