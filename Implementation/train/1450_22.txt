other than the great cinematography by the marvelous jame wong howe in the battle scene ,
this film is a true stinker.this is the second film
that i have seen in recent day
directed by alexander korda .
the first was charles laughton 's `` remandt . ''
it was so lousy that i shut it off .
this one i am
afraid
is not very much better.flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth .
perhaps 
her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standard
but
when you compare it to that of a helen mirren ,
it is absolutely no match .
in robotic fashion 
robson state her line .
her battle message to the english troop is so lackluster in spirit.even a dashing laurence olivier can not save this utter piece of boredom.future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here
and she does not really convey anything here .
to think ,
that scarlett was 2 year later !
it is a shame
that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film .
