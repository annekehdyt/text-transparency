the lady man is laugh out loud funny 
with a great diverse cast as well
as having some very stupid but excellent scene
( including the funniest love song ever written )
.ferrell is his usual quality self in a illiant side role.tim meadows
plays an idiot surprisingly well
and has written himself some of the funniest line
you will find in any comedy out there.it is definitely worth a purchase
as watching it every 6 month or so will lead to you still laughing as hard
as you did first time round.i am distraught to think at the time of writing this
that it has a meagre 4.7 /10 and i urge you to vote !
and remember kids- `` there is more motion in the ocean ''
