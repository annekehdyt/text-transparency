i picked this film up at my local liary .
having met the director at a film festival late last year ,
i was curious to `` check out '' his work .
i was pleasantly surprised.the film takes a fresh look at familiar subject 
love 
infidelity 
friendship 
jealousy .
it can be a bit 'talky ' at time
but never so much as to completely sink the film .
i enjoyed watching a love story with character
that clearly belong together
and watching them make conscious decision rather than haphazardly `` falling '' into something
as important as love.the contrast between this film and the average low-budget shoot-em ' up black film is quite distinct .
check it out .
if you are lucky ,
your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did .
good stuff !
