friday the 13th step over !
there is officially a worse movie
than your hateful series out there .
i won this movie in a contest at college ,
and it was a waste of money
even if it was free .
jack jone star as a truly awful singer
whose trying to find some murderer or something .
at least friday the thirteenth never bored me .
i would rather have my fingernail pulled than see this again .
