this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen .
from the plot 
though the shot 
the `` special effect '' 
the acting ,
and did i mentioned the plot ?
every single thing in it sucked ass ! this is a good example of what `` over-doing '' mean and i will try to explain :
i understand
what the creator of this movie was trying to do ;
this was supposed to be one of those movie
you can not really tell what the hell is going on up until the end .
you sit mesmerized ,
not knowing
who 's dead and who 's alive
and who killed who and why
and just when you think
you got the timeline right
you find out you are wrong
and the movie ends - leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minute !
something like `` uneakable '' or `` the job ''
if you know what i mean.but olga leven 
the writer of this junk 
yes 
olga \u0096 the writer 
director 
producer 
screenplay author 
caster 
production designer 
art director 
costume designer and also a double for one of the character is some scene ...
this is basically a one woman movie
and
when it comes to olga leven from `` leven production ''
you can not go wrong :
- )
well this might come as a shocker
but `` this time '' olga over did this big time ,
jumping from scene to scene 
from dream to reality ...
but wait !
this was all a dream after all ...
or was it ? ? ?
the picture fades and i realized none of this ever happened ,
the girl was all alone on the ship ...
actually there was no ship ... no wait !
there is the ship again ,
and the guys !
they are alive !
thank god !
no they are calling her
to join the cruise ...
but then the ship disappears so maybe they are dead after all ? ? ?
or maybe they never were alive to begin with ? ?
? if you understood what i just said
you might like this movie -
otherwise it is a boring piece of work and the only reason i
set through this entire crap is to find out
how the hell can they finish this movie ...
do not watch this if you value time ,
ever 90 minute are a waste in this case ...
