this is a feel good film 
about one person 's dream and the drive or push
to realize them .
it is a beautiful and inspirational film .
why do some person have to try and find fault with every film
that comes out 
especially the good one .
dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris 
a science teacher and high school baseball coach
who is pushed by his team
to take one more shot at a professional baseball career .
with excellent supporting cast ,
including brian cox 
as the crusty old ex navy officer
who has let so much of his son 's achievement go
by without his support .
it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film .
if i have one complaint with this film
it is this :
do not ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again .
seriously 
this film belongs to that handful of great baseball film like `` field of dream '' and `` the natural . ''
it rate two thumbs up and a big `` well done . ''
