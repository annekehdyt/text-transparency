eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 year ago in egypt .
really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century .
i also did not realize the series flopped .
there is a second season
airing now is not there ?
it is amazing to me
when commentary are made by those
who are either ill-informed or do not watch a show at all .
it is a waste of space on the board and of other 's time .
the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful
as the cast began to fall into place ,
but that is to be expected from any show .
the remainder of the first season is excellent .
i can hardly wait for the second season
to begin in the united state .
