how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story
that is alternately sad 
scary and life-affirming .
it ends with a utal finale
that you knew had to happen ,
even though you were hoping
-- maybe even beleiving --
it would not .
utlimately 
this is the film 's greatest strength :
it expertly plays with your emotion and expectation ,
then drops a bomb on you .
i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid-'90 .
it is not easy to find ,
but is definitely worth hunting for .
