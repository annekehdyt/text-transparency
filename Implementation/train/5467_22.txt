this was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in new york city and centering around a main character
( the title name ,
played by brad pitt )
who thinks
he '' s a ricky nelson-type musician ,
except he has no real talent .
it is kind of fun
to watch
until a profane tough new york city-type woman with horrible accent
enters the picture
and takes over .
that ruined the film for me .
it must have been catherine keener ,
who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed woman .
the hairdo on pitt - an exaggerated pompadour - was fun to look at .
i can picture johnny depp
playing this role better .
one last note :
it odd to hear a film
made in 1992
( other than woody allen 's )
with just mono sound .
