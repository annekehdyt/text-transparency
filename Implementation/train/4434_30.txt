while fred schepisi 's `` i.q . ''
does not really have any important quality ,
it is still worth seeing .
walter matthau plays albert einstein ,
trying to help mechanic ed walter
( tim robbin )
fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd
( meg ryan ) .
probably the funniest scene is when dr. frizzyhead and friend
( lou jacobi 
gene sak and joseph maher )
try to make ed look like a scientist :
he ends up
looking like a french impressionist.obviously little of the movie is historically accurate ,
but that is not the point .
it is not intended as anything except a light comedy ,
quite the opposite of robbin 's most famous movie from 1994
( the shawshank redemption ) .
a movie about einstein 's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievement 
but also his political activism 
namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine
and came out against nuclear weapon
( it got to the point
where the fbi kept a file on him )
.so anyway 
this one is acceptable .
also starring stephen fry 
tony shalhoub 
frank whaley 
charle durning and keene curtis .
