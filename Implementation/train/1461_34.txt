i have really enjoyed this adaptation of `` emma '' .i
have seen
it many time
and am always looking forward
to seeing it again.though it only lasts 107 minute ,
most of the novel plot and sub-plot were developed in a satisfactory way .
all the character are well-portrayed .
most of the dialogue come directly from the novel with no silly joke
added as in emma thompson 's sense and sensibility.as a foreigner ,
i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actor .
the setting and costume were beautiful .
i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries `` pride and prejudice ''
but then the producer and screenwriter were the same .
kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying `` emma ''
of whom jane austen said
she would create a heroin no-one
but her would love .
she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable .
mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley 
not an easy part ,
i think ,
though he has not the charisma
shown by colin firth 's mr darcy in pride and prejudice .
even the end scene
( the harvest festival )
which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end
except
for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill wherea in the novel
she was thoroughly reconciled with him ,
even telling him
that she would have enjoyed the duplicity ,
had she been in his situation .
a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film .
i find the costume more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptation from jane austen 's novel .
