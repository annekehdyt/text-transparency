** here be spoiler **the governmant has continued to develop the universalsoldier program ,
now called unisol .
the soldier are now stronger
and are able to take more damage than before .
however the governmant is downsizing 
the project endangered and the supercomputer
that is in the middle of all feel threatened ,
so he takes step
to ensure his own safety .
he activates and controls the unisol and start to run mayhem .
the only one
who can stop them
is deveraux
( van damme ) .
this movie is about one thing .
choreographed fighting .
the story is bad ,
and is soon drowned in all fight .
whatever happen ,
and wherever they go ,
they fight .
unfortunately for this movie ,
it is no fun watching a fight
where you know
one part of it is indestructible .
normally you are pretty sure the hero will win ,
but you still want to feel
the fight are between two somewhat equal combatant .
not where one is indestructible and can not lose .
then the fight just become a tool to stretch time .
you wait until the final fight
when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable fo .
to further lower my opinion 
a desperate
and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scan notily clad woman
there are .
well 
there are not really that lot of them ,
because the character are most man
( there are at least one woman unisol though ) ,
but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a a once .
the female lead get by with this ,
but we also pass through a strip-club
( to use a computer no less )
with much more undressed woman .
these momants do not give anything to the story
and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.so 
in conclusion 
boring fight .
no more 
no less .
well 
maybe less ... 2/10
