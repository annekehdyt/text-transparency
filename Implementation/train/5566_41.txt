thank to some infamous home video distributor
who ought in the so
called german independent series ,
four for venice is not only awful ,
but really awful .
so awful ,
that i have it dumped at the second hand good store for extra cash.nick and charlotte is a married couple
who reached an agreement
of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession .
eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth ,
where eva works as a waitress and luis 
an artist .
nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress .
luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick .
luis cheated on eva
by lying to her
that he would be flying off to london to do something
related to his artwork ,
but the fact is ,
he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday .
eva kidnapped nick
and dragged her 2 kid along to venice for confrontation .
the trip to venice ends up both nick
and eva falling for one another.the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva mark the failure of the comedy .
it not only look senseless 
but also draggy .
in the film 
nick try to seek help for several way ,
but it ends to no avail .
it is either the stranger around him
who acts like moron ,
or they are just simply dumb.the comedy also had the tendency
to add in unnecessary scene
to lengthen the story .
while some of the problem
that can be solved with common sense ,
no one in the film are using common sense
to solve the problem .
they prefer to go through one big round
to solve the problem.it fail so bad ,
that even the beautiful scenery in venice fail to pull up the reputation of the film .
