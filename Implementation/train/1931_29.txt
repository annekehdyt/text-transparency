i was very pleased to go
and see a `` milanese '' film shot in milan .
alessandro alatri is a roman director
who has understood properly
and fortunately
printed in a film the milanese philosophy.film
tells the story of a standard -in career- milanese couple ,
starting from `` the birth '' to the death .
the birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme
that becomes original and involves all the wedding guest in a flash back story
of how the couple came to each other
and felt in love .
life is hard in the `` urbe '' of milan
and after the sweetie old day became tougher and tougher ,
then finally the product :
a child ,
who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship
it weaken
because `` the selfish effect '' typical of a nowaday `` metropolis '' personality .
the advertising environment with all the `` creative '' under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot .
we are losing the life value
and this is well
and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle 's director.the actor are well chosen 
stefania rocca nice and well characterised 
and a positive surprise 
an unexpected good fabio volo ,
well known by the `` trash '' tv serie :
le iene.rating :
7/10
