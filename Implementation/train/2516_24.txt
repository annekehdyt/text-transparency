this film really deserves more recognition than its getting .
it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ty 
favour and allegiance within the crime world .
the film is shot beautifully
and delves into all you are classic crime theme such as betrayal and power .
this film is a movie goer film ,
it requires attention and understanding and reward fully in the end .
it is the godfather of hong kong
and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting 
martial art epic
which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china .
it features an arrangement of great character 
actor and development
although is fair to say
i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the character due
to their being so many interaction in the film .
all in all 8/10 great plot character
but there are character
that do not stand out enough
and the music did not really get me going
and at time i felt
it did not sync well with the action
( there is action by the way )
so it loses some point for that .
