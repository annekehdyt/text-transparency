pandora 's clock is among the best thriller
you will ever read
and this is one of the best thriller
you will ever see .
a highly faithful adaptation of john j. nance 's novel ,
which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel ,
is made even more so here .
despite being made for tv ,
this is first rate entertainment .
the cast is great and slips into character from the novel so well
that you would think
they were reading the novel .
richard dean anderson step way outside the shadow of macgyver
and gives the best performance of his career to date .
jane leeve is great her role as an ambassador 's assistant in a role
that proves
she can be a fine dramatic actor .
daphne zuniga is great as dr. sander
and despite the character
being a man in the book ,
it works incredibly well .
robert loggia 
edward herrmann 
robert guillaume 
and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch
and fit their novel counterpart tot
he letter.there are change to the story of course
( including and a slight change in the ending )
but those change are for the better
when compared with the novel .
the plot is realistic
and very see to believe in the way
its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie .
the production value are high
and though the special effect might look as good
as they did a decade or so ago ,
they work fine .
set are great 
especially cia hq and the oval office
showing
that the filmmaker spent a lot of time
to make this work.it does not matter
if you see this first
and read then read the novel or vice versa .
just do both and you will not regret losing four hour to this film
and however long it takes to read the novel .
this will leave you eathless .
