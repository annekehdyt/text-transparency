no 
i am not joking around .
if you ever 
ever 
have the chance
to see this movie see it .
if you need chop off your arm to see it ,
see it .
it is worth it.fatty drife the bus is unlike any film
you have ever seen .
it takes trash cinema
and elevates it to a work of art .
while it contains poor shot 
idiotic character 
bad dialogue 
strange acting 
and cinematography
that belongs on public access in iowa ,
it actually succeeds in its goal as a film .
it strives to be the dumbest 
strangest 
most inane movie
you have ever seen .
and boy does it ever succeed.i will lay out the plot for those of you
who worry about such thing
( the filmmaker obviously did not ) ,
but really you need n't pay too much attention
because the entire film 's plot is presented in a very long piece of text
played before the opening credit .
in any event 
fdtb
( as its admirer call it )
is the story of a bus tour through chicago ,
which is led by satan .
you see 
jesus is in town ,
and all the passenger on the bus are supposed to die ,
and all their soul would have gone to hell 
except with jesus in town 
a lackey in hell calls off the job 
and this anger satan because 
well he does not like looking like a fool in front of the guy ,
so he decides to get the person on the bus
to sign over their soul to him directly ,
but he is a devil ,
so he needs to disguise himself 
otherwise ,
who 'd go on a tour with him right ,
so he disguises himself as roger
and he gets on the bus ,
where the driver is never referred to by name ,
but he is kind of fat ,
so i guess
he is fatty .
the bus
( and the rider )
are on a collision course with wackiness ! example of some lunacy :
the title repeats on the screen 3 time .
i do not know why .
a character appears on the bus in mid-trip
without explanation or introduction ,
and occassionally sit next to the other ,
and they look at her like
she does not belong .
i do not know why .
two character fall in love and exchange longing glance ,
that are really the same shot
repeated over and over again .
i do not know why .
after satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes
`` satan is going to transform . ''
i do not know why .
one character is a woman
who is very obviously a man in drag ,
and is referred to by other character as `` the glamorous bridget . ''
i do not know
why.if there was one good thing
that came out of my internship at troma last summer
it was getting my own copy of fatty drife the bus .
