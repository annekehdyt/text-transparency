this was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie
that i shall never tire of watching many 
many time .
the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older character .
there are those of us out here
who really do appreciate good actor and an intelligent story format .
as for judi dench 
she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production
in which she stars .
i always make a point to see judi dench in all her performance .
she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life .
i can only be grateful
when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good character 
good script and good acting .
the movie public needs hero 
not deviant manikin ,
who lack ingenuity and talent .
how wonderful to see old favorite like leslie caron 
olympia dukakis and cleo laine .
i would like to see this movie win
the award it deserves .
thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment .
i congratulate the writer 
director 
producer 
and all those
who did such a fine job .
