those individual familiar with asian cinema 
as a whole 
are aware
that japan is renowned 
or notorious ,
for it is hyper-violent film
and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously utal film .
dog bite dog ,
while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest miike film ,
nor is it as unapologetically utal
as some korea more ambitious effort ,
it is a perfect in between with its own and of utality all
it is own .
the greatest strength this film has though 
like the greatest of the japanese or korean effort 
is that the utality 
rather than detracting from the film 
actually develops the character 
if not ,
pushing the story forward .
the two main character are both incredibly vicious individual with their own motivation and emotional underpinning for being as such .
sam lee 's character 
for instance 
is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely 
amidst various encounter with chang 's character ,
it is revealed
why he is .
without spoiling this part of the story too much ,
it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father .
chang 's character 
on the other hand 
has his most primal instinct honed to 
if not perfection 
utal efficiency .
surprisingly 
chang 's story arch ,
while not necessarily revealing a more human side ,
actually reveals a side to our animal nature
which many forget
about which is the natural ability
to recognize a fellow oken animal
( and no i am not talking about sam lee 
rather pei pei 's garbage dump girl character ) .
ultimately however 
for the first 80 minute or so 
it is a 
more or less 
straight forward cat and mouse 
or dog chase dog 
film
in which every encounter ends in at least one death
( seriously ,
once sam lee and chang square off ,
some one will die )
and the fun part of movie is you never know
who hands will commit the act .
which ings us to the film 's one weakness .
unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but ,
to put it simply ,
it is guilty of pushing one of the main point of the film since ,
rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minute into the film ,
the film goes on for another 20 minute
or so to further emphasize it .
do not get me wrong ,
if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax
and if the final act was not filled with sweet music
( in fact if it 
like the majority of the film 
kept the music to the barest minimum
and let the disturbing sound effect do their job ) ,
it still could have worked
and not detract from the film .
as it is though ,
despite the third act
having the most vicious and bloody of the encounter ,
the way
it was handled made
it feel
tacked on ,
and almost 
insults the viewer intelligence since it felt
it had to go this far
to get it across .
nevertheless 
it is still a eath of fresh air from hong kong cinema
since even the most bloody of the martial art film never reaches the level of viciousness and utality
while keeping the the character archs in tact .
