this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible power
that must be put to use
when a man-turned-flying demon is let loose on the world .
the cgi is par for a tv job ,
and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine .
familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby 's mentor ,
but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level .
we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start 
a bad sign .
also 
the scene
where burgi is training appleby for battle
are actually laughable .
they are a bad copy of similar scene in several other movie 
most notably remo william .
