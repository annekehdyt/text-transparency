this movie does not even deserve a one .
this was an utter waste of time .
it was a waste of film and money .
it was not offensive
but everything was provocative and disgusting .
my spoiler is one
that i think should be read by everyone .
there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language .
but not only that 
there is no plot line ,
the actor are terrible ,
the accent are horrible ,
the actor are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie !
the only reason i rented
it was for brian van holt
( who got only a fifteen second part ,
by the way ) .
i think
this might have been a mistake on the director and editor part
but they repeated the same segment two or three time ,
adding only a new sentence.a film similar to this is eraser head 
possibly the most disturbing movie in existence .
there is no plot line ,
and is not funny .
although it is not trying to be funny .
do not watch either movie .
