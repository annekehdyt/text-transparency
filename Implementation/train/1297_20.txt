i wonder
if there is any sense of sense in this movie .
its a big joke .
good.. its entertaining .. you get to see the most stupid plot
played very seriously in the form of a film .. i wonder
which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.priety
( a pros )
plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman/rani
who want a child
but can not .
i wonder
how it would be
if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple 's life.rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house
who has been ought in to make a child for her and salman .
she cares for priety
and try pushing her husband salman to preity
so they may have some romance .
when will the audience get fed up of salman 's nakhras.though a good past-time ,
this movie is unbearable .
absurd .
