i caught this movie on fx last night ,
and as i was sitting there watching it ,
it occurred to me
that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever .
bad acting 
bad cinematography 
bad sound 
totally unbelievable fight sequence 
stupid character .
all these made it up
to be the most laughably bad movie i
have ever seen .
it was so bad ,
i was enthralled by it is sheer lack of anything semi-competent
that i had to keep watching ...
and they made a sequel !
