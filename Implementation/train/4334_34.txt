start of with the good bit :
several time swayze talk zulu to his friend or that language is heard among the tribe .
that is a great plus ,
as normally usa and uk movie audience think
all person on this planet speak english
( just in case you are one of them :
no they do not )
.but the acting is 'tenenkrommend '
as we say in the netherland
( it makes your to curl -and
not in a good way ) .
i like swayze but in this he is awful .
the muscle in his jaw make overtime and he is frowning the whole movie -some
one must have told him it looks butch .
no patrick :
it looks silly
and is compensation for lack of character .
alison doody
( elizabeth )
has opted for a style of acting
that does not meet the style of her co-worker .
her acting is s\u00f3 relaxed
that this movie could have been set in the current day .
and it is not .
your frock was a clue ,
alison.the best acting came from the person from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best .
clear 
warm and in character 
his performance is a joy to watch .
general :
it is mwah-entertaining on a rainy day .
pity .
could have been better .
sack the director .
