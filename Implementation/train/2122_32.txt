this movie was slower then molasses in january ... in alaska .
the man
who put togeather the preview
should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 second
that were interisting into the preview .
i had to wake up the person
i was watching it with 
several time .
after it was over ,
i felt bad for having woken them up .
most of the film is taken up with hoping something
will actually happen ,
but nothing ever does .
it was easy to loose track of person 's motive ,
and the character were flat and uninteristing .
by the end of the movie 
you just hoped
everyone would died .
everyone runs around either being contemptible 
petty 
or pitiful ,
and usually all three .
and worse 
we watched a minute or two of the added feature ,
just for kick
and giggle you understand ,
and all that we saw was person being smug about how socially aware they are .
if they had spend the time on the movie
that they did patting themselves on the back ,
it might have been worth watching .
i was ought in expecting the excitement of '24 . '
i got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eye of the sandman .
