salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their life .
we see them panhandling in a car of the underground ,
where their pitch
to get donation
is so lame ,
no one gives them anything !
salva ,
who is a hardened petty criminal
does not even have any redeeming quality ,
that is ,
until he discovers a reality show on television
that gives him the idea of what to do next .
religion and show business prove to be a winning combination ,
something
that salva capitalizes on.he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest
that was critical of the duo .
salva show he is a natural for the reality show .
he transforms himself into a christ-like figure
who is an instant success in the program .
espe ,
who is a no-nonsense woman
who is show 's producer ,
can not escape from the way
salva pays her unusual attention .
ultimately 
salva is the victim of his own success in the end.jordi molla ,
whose first directorial job this movie is ,
had some success in the way
the film satirizes the role of television .
spain ,
which was vulnerable to these type of program ,
has seen its share of the bizarre ,
which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public
and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the person
that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.the ensemble cast has some good moment in the film .
mr. molla 
like any actor
who decides to direct his first feature ,
would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera .
candela pena 
a good actress 
is one of the best reason
for watching the movie .
juan carlos villedo 
david gimenez cacho 
franco francescoantonio 
florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director .
