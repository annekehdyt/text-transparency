no plot 
crappy acting 
and pointless gore ... .this is supposed to be a horror movie ?
there is no fear 
or suspense ,
just boom bang gore ,
then done .
some kinda marine are in the desert for some weird 
crappy reason
and they get hunted down by those mutated beast from the first movie ,
which was good ,
and should have been left
it at that.this is just another excuse for money 
and use of pointless violence 
just like the `` saw '' sequel .
they know no matter how pointless the plot is ,
and the more gore they can add ,
person will see it .
i miss good suspenseful horror movie .
come on hollywood ,
you can do much 
much better .
