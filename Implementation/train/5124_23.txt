having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series
without seeing any of them ,
i looked forward to this eagerly .
surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong .
how wrong i was !
the polemic ,
backed by frequent 
repetitive and violent flashback ,
were overpowering .
the production tried to be super-modern 
but the flashing box and even the childish font irritated .
robbie coltrane sleep-walked through the two hour ,
coming up with unexplained and unlikely `` insight '' ,
and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiot .
as a result 
the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene
( no detail for fear of spoiler )
was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama
as i have seen for a long time.no ,
i do not want to see any more of these ,
but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series
to see
if they match their reputation .
