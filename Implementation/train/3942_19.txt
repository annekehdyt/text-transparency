shall we dance is an excellent film
because it shows how something 
like dancing 
can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit.dance is seen as the expression of existence 
and the birth of individuality .
the is certainly the case with aoki .
at work he is a humble office denizen ,
but place him on the dance floor
and all his bottled up intensity is released .
surprisingly 
this release is frowned upon in japan 
due to the rigid culture of conformity .
at the start of the film 
all the character are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance .
they will be scorned 
or deemed perverted ,
for expressing their passion through dance.this film is well worth watching
to witness the rebirth of human emotion and passion .
it will leave a smile on your face for day .
