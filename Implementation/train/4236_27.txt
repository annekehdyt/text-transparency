a pale shadow of a great musical 
this movie suffers from the fact
that the director 
richard attenborough 
completely misses the point of the musical ,
needlessly `` open '' it up ,
and muddies the thrust of the play .
the show is about a group of dancer auditioning for a job in a b'way musical
and examines their drive
and desire
to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work .
attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls ,
assuming
that they are trying to get their `` big eak '' in show business ,
rather than presenting the grittier mix of character
created on stage as a group of working `` gypsy ''
living show to show ,
along with a couple of newcomer .
the film has one advantage over the play
and that is the opening scene ,
showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line
( depending on how you count cassie ,
who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie ) .
anyone
who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play
will have a much richer experience
than seeing this poorly-conceived film .
