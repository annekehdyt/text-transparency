i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say
i have not had so much fun at a movie in a long time .
wes craven is at his best ever .
he ings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving .
this is the thriller of the year..no doubt .
all the actor are amazing
and the action is realistic and fun .
the f/x were great .
it steadily built suspense .
i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie .
it is been a while
since i heard an audience cheer and clap
and get excited in a theater .
if your looking for thrill 
action and a good plot this summer 
redeye deliver .
go see it !
