in the immediate aftermath
following world war ii ,
sound mind in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving
that is a natural ingredient in a war effort .
`` best year of our life ' and even 'gentleman 's agreemant ' investigated the way
americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war 
but delmer dave ' `` pride of the marine '' beat them to it.the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield
who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole 
with japanese soldier eerily crying out at him and his buddy `` mariiine 
tonight you die !
`` 
he is blinded by a hand-grenade ,
and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her
after coming home.delmer dave is uncompromising in his depiction on these man
who are ave ,
as it were 
almost by coincidence .
they are there 
in the foxhole ,
and when shot at 
they react .
so much for heroism ,
but they get the job done .
and then comes the self-pity 
the dark 
gloomy sense of humor .
garfield is in angry denial of his blindness
and the film makes no excuse ,
`` there is no free candy for anyone in this world '' ,
as his buddy tells him .
the same guy 
a jew ,
played by dane clark 
remind him ,
`` in a war somebody gets it ,
and you are it .
everybody 's got problem !
when i get back ,
some guy will not hire me ,
because my name is diamond '' .great movie are made with gut like these ,
and if the first half hour of 'pride of the marine ' fail to rise to the occasion completely ,
from then on it evolves into a true work of art .
you weep ,
and you ponder ,
you ache and you hope against hope .
well 
simply : art .
