brand hauser
( john cusack )
is an assassin for the cia .
he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan 
a nation
that the united state has `` liberated '' ,
and kill a businessman named omar shariff .
this is because the american conglomerate 
tamerlane ,
that is putting the country `` back together ''
will not stand for shariff 
an oil man from a neighboring state ,
laying down his own pipeline through war-torn turquistan .
but 
once there 
brand run into difficulty .
one 
he meets a determined journalist 
natalie
( marisa tomei )
who wants to tell the american public the `` true '' story of the region 's conflict ... and of tamerlane .
but 
brand is aghast to realize
that natalie 's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compel him to lose focus on his mission .
also 
his cover as a trade show host force him to meet the country 's pop-singing princess 
yonica
( hillary duff ) ,
who will be getting married at the convention center .
she is a young diva
whose wedding arrangement also turn brand 's attention away from the coming assassination .
with other inept underling and complication 
will brand be able to carry out his mission 
for the satisfaction of tamerlane 's big boss 
the former vice-president
( dan ackroyd ) ?
good for you 
john cusack 
to make this film ,
even though it does not quite hold together .
shot in serbia ,
it is a worthy look at what present-day iraq must be like ,
a country turned upside-down .
in a stroke a illiance 
the green zone here is called `` the emerald city '' and aptly so 
for this oz-like neighborhood attempt
to keep out the ravage of war
going on elsewhere in the metropolis .
the cast is very fine ,
with cusack doing a nice job and tomei 
joan cusack 
ben kingsley 
ackroyd and other backing him up in style .
duff 
especially 
does a great turn as the heavily-accented 
heavily made-up 
potty-mouthed singer .
the recreation of war-riddled baghdad is so real
that it hurts
while the costume and other production value are top-notch .
as for the script 
it is not always cohesive
but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scene .
for example 
a young turaqui boy offer to show brand an enemy hideout 
in exchange for money and candy .
brand produces the cash but ,
because he has no candy ,
the boy burns his vehicle anyway .
brilliant !
then 
also 
the direction is not a total success
but does not lag very often .
no ,
if you have conservative leaning ,
you probably will not like this film one bit .
but ,
if you have an open mind
and want to see a satirical view of the `` war on terrorism '' ,
this is quite a good show .
therefore 
do make an effort to view it ,
as you will be supporting those filmmaker
who choose to make movie far away from those old studio `` formulas '' .
