i recently watched spirit
and enjoyed it very much ,
i have seen it about 4 time now on hbo
and will buy the dvd .
those
who gave negative review
would probably think
that `vanishing point ' was just another car chase movie and `thelma and louise ' was just another chick flick .
although the conclusion of those film are darker i feel
the theme are somewhat related ;
that freedom and individualism are very important
and that there is usually someone wanting
to take it away from you .
the other common trait of these movie is the caring 
thoughtful `guardian angel ' type
who help the main character
to overcome adversity.another review here
mentions
how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else 's home .
all one has to do is look around at the dwindling open area
around us
to see that.i thought
the animation
and the story were amazing ,
the animator really got the horse
to look 
act and move naturally .
spirit is emotion were very clear as the story progressed
( yes
i am aware
they do humanize the horse a bit ,
but this is fiction ) .
in a couple of action scene
you feel
caught in the current of the rapid and the heat from a forest fire .
in other more quiet scene
( which are most of the time )
you are allowed to savor the background .
one of the big thing
that make the story
really work
is by not going the talking ,
singing animal route .
doing so would take away from the story 's power .
instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character ,
further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack .
another plus is that they were not afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side
( which really made this film watchable to me ) .
this is not prevalent through the entire movie though ,
and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting
without being sappy.those
who appreciate horse
will really like this movie ,
but i think
it is a bit more than a horse movie .
i do not feel
this would be a good movie
to take child
to if they are ought up on the inane fare
that is offered up today .
but if they are the thoughtful sort
that can handle compelling story like the lord of the ring and black beauty
they will likely love this movie .
hell 
i am 35 year old
and still love that stuff .
