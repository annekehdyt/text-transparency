i got to see the whole movie last night
and i found
it very exciting.it was at least 
not like the teen-slasher movie
that pop out every now and then.the search for the killer and the 'partner ' relationship between the heroandthe so-called bad guy
was part i liked about the movie.also ,
i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie.i mean
it is exciting.maybe some time later ,
i might watch the movie again ...
