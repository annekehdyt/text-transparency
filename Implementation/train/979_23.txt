this is a great 
ridiculous horror movie
that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s ' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was .
i can remember being freaked out by metal teen
when i was a kid .
it does not help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown 's graveyard
when i was ten .
turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old body
and used their bone in some weird sacrifice to satan .
so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile ,
but i love it now ,
as a 24 year old.i bought this dvd
used for 6 buck
and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover ,
but to my surprise 
it ruled .
it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal .
and you got ta love a scene
where a guitar shoots lazer and vaporizes headbanger in the crowd .
this movie is awesome ,
if you love 80s metal and bad movie ,
this one 's for you .
9/10 !
