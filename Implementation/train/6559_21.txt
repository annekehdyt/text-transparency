cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film .
the best way i have been able to explain
it is that it is quite acidic .
though it is not totally random .
the story is about nyatta 
a young cat boy and his sister nyaako .
nyaako is very ill and dy 
however ,
nyatta sees her soul
being taken away by death
and is able to retrieve half of it .
the story is about their quest to ing nyaako
fully back to life.though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random ,
it is not .
most of it is symbolism for life 
death and rebirth .
you can also see reference from other tale 
such as hansel and gretal .
this strangely cute short film has an interesting story ,
packed with a deeper meaning
than what you see on the surface of the screen .
