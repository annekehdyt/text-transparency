cedric kahn 's film have been character-based 
rather than action-based
( i am thinking of l'ennui and feux rouge )
so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chase
interspersed with some plodding attempt
to give character to succo .
i do not find stefano cassettus to be an interesting actor ;
he reminds me of pro athlete
who are coaxed into movie 
like bret favre .
that blank stare look like a really vicious deer
caught in the headlight .
a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo 's personality ,
rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco
as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm .
the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in .
le besco apart 
there is little to recommend this film .
