hollywood often gives us trash
because not enough family go to see quality film .
this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith .
it had no violence 
no lewdness ,
and did not deserve a pg rating .
the western scenery was filmed well ,
and some of the vista were simply eathtaking .
actor were a bit young for their part 
but otherwise believable and talented .
music score was too loud ,
and in some place drowned out the dialog completely .
i am seldom surprised by movie
ending any more ,
but i was pleasantly surprised by this one .
sometimes the good guy do win ,
and they win by honest effort .
we liked the movie and the message ,
and would recommend it for the entire family .
