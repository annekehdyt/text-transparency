this movie was one of the worst i
have ever seen .
pure drivel .
how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine ,
or have empathy for her ,
is beyond me .
i felt
i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder .
just terrible.in its most generous light ,
this can be seen as an attempt at producing and `` art '' film -
except i could not 
for the life of me 
find any art
in it at all.if this woman
had lived in today ' world ,
she would have been whisked off to a mental institution
and given a couple of day treatment with anti-psychotic medication .
that 
or simply allowed to roam the street and become a bag woman .
why other character in this movie found anything redeeming in her -
and tried to aid her in her quest
to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristic
she had
that made her worth
that effort .
