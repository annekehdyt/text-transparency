as a girl 
hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo ,
leaving behind her two best friend 
fumiya and sayori .
she returns as a young woman ,
surprised to find that sayori died
when she was a teenager .
she reunites with fumiya
and they are horrified to learn
that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku .
oh boy .
i rented this
because i like asian horror and i think
chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress .
unfortunately ,
if i had to describe shikoku in one word ,
it would be `` fruity . ''
this movie is silly 
boring 
poorly filmed 
unimaginative 
and most of all 
unscary .
kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori ,
and her character is given little to work with .
