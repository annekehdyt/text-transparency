one of the best part of sundance is seeing movie
that you would otherwise almost certainly miss .
unless you are a real art-house devotee ,
you probably do not catch many documantary .
only a handful get any recognizable distribution .
fortunately 
sundance has increased its commitmant to documantary in recent years.shakespeare behind bar is a powerful documantary about a dramatic production group at the luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange 
kentucky .
every year a group of inmate present a shakespearean play .
director hank rogerson and his crew follow the troupe
as role are self-selected ,
interpreted 
rehearsed and ultimately performed.the movie is filled with fascinating revelation for those of us
that have not been exposed to prison environmant .
despite the label we know them by
( convict 
felon 
murderer 
etc . )
we soon began to appreciate and respect these man
as thinking feeling human being .
serendipitously 
the play chosen for the year of filming was the tempest 
with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption .
the actor all grapple with the relevance of the play to their life ,
finding pattern
and parallel with their character and the meaning of the drama.for a documantary film 
like a book 
the best
that can be hoped for is that we experience something
that changes our life .
shakespeare behind bar was a personal revelation for me .
`` o ave new world ,
that has such creature in it . ''
