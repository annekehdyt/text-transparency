three story line and not enough tying them together ,
`` inside man '' was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt
to be artistic and realistic .
though having its moment ,
the movie started off looking like a fast thriller
which quickly grounded to a slow crawl ,
jumped quickly between high and lows ,
and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minute .
i will give credit to denzel washington ,
he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side
and not just the typical `` super-detective '' with all the answer .
clive owen also did quite well with his duality part as `` evil genius '' and `` criminal mastermind ''
( both not the same in retrospect ) .
overall though 
each person individually created a great sub-section .
yet ,
when the part finally came together and everything counted ,
there was no sudden `` ah-ha ! ''
or summation of everything .
it all ended up with very little of the energy
it began with 
with a lot of plot-hole 
ton of question ,
and as i said earlier ,
no where near spike lee 's normal level .
i have to completely disagree with the so-called `` professional critic '' ...
this is not the movie
they play it up to be .
