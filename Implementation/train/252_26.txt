one may ask why ?
the character snarl 
yell 
and chew the scenery
without any perceptible reason
except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona .
billie baldwin 
is that the right one ? 
is forgettable in the cop/estranged-husband/loving-father-of-cute-little-blond-girl role .
the story seems to have been cut
and pasted from the scene thrown away from adventure film in the last three year .
ellen pompeo 's lack of charisma is a black hole
that seems to suck the energy out of every scene
she is in .
her true acting range is displayed
when she takes her blouse off as the movie careens from one limp chase scene to another .
unfortunately 
the directing rarely goes bad enough
to be camp or a parody .
it is all just clich\u00e9 
familiar in every respect .
the director cast his own daughter as the precocious at probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client
to ruin a career
by being in such a lame 
contrived and uninteresting movie .
the only heist here is the theft of the investor 's money and the viewer 's time .
