i agree totally with another of the reviewer here
who was pleased `` for the bird ''
won the oscar in 2002 for `` best animated short 
'' not this sick material ,
which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone 
of course ,
who has no belief in heaven or hell.the animation
was good ,
but so are a lot of animated short .
and 
by the way 
i love dark humor
but this just was unappealing from the start.as for the story here :
a guy walking around
and surrounded by nothing but grey
( symbolism here )
is told by a tv set
( which appears every few hundred yard away )
that he is in either heaven 
hell 
or purgatory .
each time he puts a gun to his head and shoot himself
after hearing the news .
i guess
that would be funny in two of the three instance .
