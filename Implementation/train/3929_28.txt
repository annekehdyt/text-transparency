ok 
i would not normally watch a farrelly other movie .
i can not recall ever watching one .
i also do not recall watching a jimmy fallon movie .
alright 
i did watch taxi ,
but i said
penance and was forgiven for that mistake .
but 
this movie had drew barrymore
and i just think
she is the cutest thing .
i do not know
what it is about her ,
but i just smile the whole time i am watch her .
she just captivates me that way .
i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first date .
how sad is that ?
this was not the greatest baseball movie -
it was not supposed to be .
it was a love story about a sad puppy
that hung on to the only thing
that never let him down
until he found something worth giving
that up for .
it had a predictable ending ,
but there was so much on the way there
that made it worthwhile .
