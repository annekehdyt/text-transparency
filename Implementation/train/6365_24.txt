sorry ,
but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hope
of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one
that i now face .
the father dy and the mother asks santa in a letter to ing him back to the family for christmas 
... and santa does .
dad is peachy 
happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact
that he had died .
all ends syrupy sweet.but as a parent
who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend ,
it was a horror flick .
now my son is convinced
that all he has to do to ing his buddy back
is to ask santa !
do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart- no amount of persuasion will convince him
that it was only a movie
and that his dog is not coming back for christmas .
it has been heart eaking to watch his joy only to know
that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh.shame on you on behalf of all the believer
that have lost a loved one recently .
it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child ,
but there are some wish
that we should not even portray as a possibility .
