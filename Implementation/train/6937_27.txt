why did i waste 1.5 hour of my life watching this ?
why was this film even made ?
why am i even commenting on this film ?
one reviewer said
this film took patience to watch
and it was n't for everybody .
i can not figure out
who this movie is for .
maybe after dropping a hit of acid 
somebody ,
somewhere could watch this
and make some sense out of it .
it is incoherent ,
it is not experimental ,
it is plain and simple garbage .
the film follows no plot line whatsoever ,
just
when you think
you have something ,
well ... ..you do not .
i think
the ending ought some finality to the film
( no pun intended ) ,
the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on .
i do not think i put a spoiler in here ,
not that it would matter .
this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom .
