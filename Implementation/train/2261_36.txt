i remember
when the golden child was released in 1986
it was universally panned by the critic ,
and i`m talking panned so badly
that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy
so i guess
this movie has something going for itit gets off to a bad start
where buddist monk kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face .
bad guy enter the templechild sits with blank expressionbad guy chop up the monkchild sits with blank expressionbad guy
pull out giant bird cage
and stick the child inside
who now sits with ... go on guess ?
you do get the impression
that
even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d
still give the same blank expression ,
this movie would be better titled the wooden childthe title sequence start
and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily .
obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time
but now in 2004 it seems very dated .
not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening .
in fact that`s the main problem
( and boy it`s a serious one )
with this movie -
the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene
so much so
that sometimes it`s like watching scene from totally different movie spliced together .
i blame the director personally
but it should also be pointed out
that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too .
did anyone know
before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ?
it`s part fantasy 
part martial art 
part buddy movie 
part comedy and it`s all crap
