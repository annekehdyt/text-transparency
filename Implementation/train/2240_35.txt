where do i start ?
per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity ,
in the end i was severally let down .
this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene ,
rather it is a hollywood
( or pick your film
making hub )
story loosely based on some real life character .
i should have had a clue
when i heard a heavy english accent
giving the intro to the movie in german ;
the blood red text
( title 
artist )
should have been the 2nd clue .
the story line is contrived
( lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann 's parent ,
there is no info
that liebermann helped smuggle jew from germany ,
the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime
not while under control ,
the record played at the station was picked up in vienna
while a lt. was there on leave 
etc 
etc )
the costume are poor and incorrect for the time frame
( ss black uniform
used every where from border guard to staff position ,
these went away from daily use
once the war started 
etc ) ,
the character are stereo type
( sa bully in a club
once they were essentially out of power ) .
do not waste your time .
