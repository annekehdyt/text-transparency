although too young to remember the first showing of the series
( being just a baby )
i later caught repeat of it on television in the late 80 's ,
just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspect .
it was my grandfather
who first showed me the series
and also gave me my first interest ,
relating tale of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific .
since then i have devoured many book
and seen many television series about the world war two era 
with mixed opinion .
the british television station are generally very good at producing these ,
as the world at war can easily attest ,
with many gem made by both the bbc and independent company .
i strongly recommend such title as `` the nazis - a warning from history '' 
`` blitz '' and the bbc series about dunkirk .
`` britain at war in colour '' 
with its companion series `` japan '' 
`` germany '' and `` america '' are of a very high standard .
the world at war is by far the best and ,
despite its age ,
never fails to deliver .
there will always be new revelation about the war
that will keep cropping up
that obviously are not included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas
that
to produce a series with every detail
would take more time and money then any other ,
even if such an undertaking was even possible .
what i feel i must say to those
who decry
that it does not include everything is that the world at war can not physically do that as a series
but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research -
and make it enjoyable .
that certainly worked for me :
i now have a very comprehensive liary of book 
video 
dvds and tape and cd .
recommend to anyone with even a passing interest .
the series was so well made
that they had find it hard not to agree
that it is quality programming and highly informative .
