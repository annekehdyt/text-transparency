this is a pretty strange movie .
it does comes across as an exploitation film with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situation ,
but unusual for being constructed around rural character at war with each other ,
as opposed to an invading 'other'.the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veteran 
in a long line of film
that portrayed the vet of that war as dangerous psycopath .
kris kristofferson 's last line is 'i are not lost a war yet ' ,
as he meets his demise
after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction ,
including the town 's chief of police and his other 's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene .
however 
kristofferson is a good enough actor 
and charismatic enough ,
to carry this villain with a surprising depth .
vincent is clearly the golden boy 
but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness .
the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73
where jimmy stewart try to tolerate a criminal other
until being forced to act against him.the movie
has b-movie grade action 
though the presence of kristofferson 
vincent 
a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peter give it an a-grade lineup.i give it a 7
for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post-vietnam/pre-reagan introspection 
paranoia 
and confusion 
and a movie industry
that was willing to address such topic at that time.seen on the this channel 
a great network
that keeps
playing lot of old movie of the 70s through 90s ,
regardless of political bent .
