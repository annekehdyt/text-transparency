excellent film dealing with the life of an old man
as he looks back over the year .
starting around 1910 ,
he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood ;
his family 
friend 
romance 
etc .
very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale ... . ''
all thing in life come together as one ,
and a river runs through it .
and that river haunts me . ''
worth seeing .
