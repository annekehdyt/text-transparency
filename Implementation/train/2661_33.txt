up to this point ,
gentle rain was the movie i
found the worst in history .
it has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster ' out of asia .
it has one `` star ''
and it is john rhys davy .
he is way out of shape
to be the swashbuckling ,
magical flying baddie he is cast here .
the rest of these person could not act their way out of a junior high school play .
no clich\u00e9s were missed in the dialogue ,
and the special effect were phoned in as often as possible.it is fairly easy to see
that somebody in asia had some buck
and needed to create a vehicle for some actor
they wanted to throw money at .
or maybe it was a director or a writer
that needed a credit .
my guess is that any career with this movie in it is credentialdo yourself a major favor
and do not watch this movie .
a hundred thanksgiving could not consume this turkey.the one funny scene
was unintentional .
the other of the king appears on the scene .
the king ?
a handsome 
older 
short asian actor .
( bad actor . )
the other ?
a six foot european .
( also a bad actor . )
no excuse were made for this .
they just expected us not to notice
that this poor man 's jet li 's other was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap dimestore `` injun '' wig right out of an old western movie from the forty .
