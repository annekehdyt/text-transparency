i am going to go on the record as the second person
who has ,
after year of using the imdb
to look up movie ,
been motivated by nacho 's film ,
the abandoned
to create an account and post a comment .
this was hands down
the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .
the plot was on the verge of non-existence ,
and none of the `` puzzle-piece '' added up in any way whatsoever .
the acting was laughable
and the writing was embarrassing .
how this film got backed
and came to be is completely beyond me .
the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille 's cunning and repetitive use of the f word .
( and illiant sound design )
if i were faced with the option
of seeing this film again
or being mauled by wild bore i would be up against a difficult decision .
i am disappointed
that i am unable to give it 0 star .
