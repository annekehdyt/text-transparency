this movie had more hole than a piece of swiss cheese .
ben affleck was seriously not trying to act in any way 
shape 
or form .
he outright sucked .
nothing about the movie was believable .
the first problem were in the intro-
where the man gives everything of value to the salvation army santa claus
but it does not show why .
and then the granny sticks her head in the oven- really beautiful ,
and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie-
it is not even in the same tone as the movie .
there was no explanation of the motivation for ben affleck
to choose the house
he chose ;
there was not any believable reaction by the family
he chose ;
and person are swayed here
and there
without any cause to be swayed
( example :
christina applegate and ben affleck 's character go tobogganing down a steep slope- this is the incident
that makes her suddenly fall in love with him .
riiiight ... ) anyway 
there was a funny moment or two-
but they were a rarity in the movie .
it seriously needed another rewrite
( or 4 ) .
hope you enjoy !
