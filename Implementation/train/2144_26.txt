50 year old 
this musical comedy fantasy might look its age ,
but it wears it with dignity.this film is still great fun .
crosby was never really romantic lead material ,
but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs .
bendix play oad
and is huge fun in a part
which calls upon his strength .
hardwicke - how joyous for a knight of the realm - a genuine one -
to throw himself into capering like this with such abandon .
and rhonda fleming enjoy herself in the least showy of the main role .
only murvyn vye disappoint as an unconvincing merlin.though not a musical ,
the song are very good ,
and the `` dance '' routine accompanying busy
doing nothing is perfect - funny 
appropriate 
dexterous
without being challenging ,
and making a virtue out of crosby 's musical movement
which 
let 's be fair ,
was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength.the colour is fine ,
the sound is a little muddy in places.and the story - well ,
it takes some liberty with the original ,
but i suspect
that mr clemen might well have been pleased with the result .
