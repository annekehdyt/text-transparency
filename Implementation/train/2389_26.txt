other reviewer have summarized this film noir well .
i just wanted to add to the `` whew ! ''
comment one reviewer
made regarding elisha cook 's obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode .
this was a doozy ,
i must say .
cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance.a bit of trivia
that i am surmising about :
cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film 
`` ball of fire . ''
he was a waiter in the nightclub
where barbara was singing
and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming 
most energetically .
is it too much to suggest
that cook 's spazzy drumming in the later film 
`` phantom lady 
'' was very much inspired by krupa 's work 
as witnessed by cook 3 year earlier ?
if you watch krupa in `` ball of fire 
''
i think
you will note some clearly similar body movement .
one hopes 
of course ,
that he was not influenced by any drug at the time !
