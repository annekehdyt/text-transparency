this is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film
that can be infuriating to watch .
i say
that
because how utal a hounding press can be to person ,
in this case an innocent australian couple
charged with killing their baby.meryl streep
received a lot of recognition for her performance
when this film came out
but i thought
sam neill was just as good .
let 's just say
they both were excellent
but the role was little harder for streep
because she had to learn an australian accent .
( she learned it so well i
had trouble understanding her in part .
)
without giving anything away ,
all i can say
is this movie will wear you out emotionally .
