`` american nightmare '' is officially tied 
in my opinion 
with `` it is pat ! ''
for the worst movie of all time.seven friend
( oddly resembling the k-mart version of the cast of `` friend '' )
gather in a coffee shop
to listen to american nightmare ,
a pirate radio show .
it is hosted by a guy with a beard .
that is the most exciting aspect of his show.chandler 
monica 
joey 
and ... oh wait 
i mean 
wayne 
jessie ,
and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turn revealing their biggest fear to the bearded dj .
unbeknownst to them 
a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening ...
crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and ... wait 
sorry again ...
by making their fear come to life .
these fear include such stunner as `` voodoo ''
and being gone down on by old lady with dentures.no .
really.this movie was 
in a word 
rotten .
crazy nurse 's killing spree lack motivation ,
there is nothing to make the viewer `` jump 
''
the ending blow 
and
-- again --
voodoo ?
if you have absolutely no regard for your loved one 
rent `` american nightmare '' with them.if you care for your loved one --
even a little bit --
go to your local blockbuster ,
rent all of the copy of `` american nightmare ''
and hide them in your freezer .
