unless you are twelve ,
this movie really is not worth it .
it is obviously a low-budget film with b actor ,
and with a genre like fantasy
that sometimes requires intense cgi work
that is not good .
i knew
it would be bad
when i rented it .
i enjoy laughing at bad movie .
i did not know how bad though .
it is bearable ,
until after hour 2 ,
then it really starts to burn .
fighting style go between normal fighting
that obey the law of physic 
and wire-fighting .
there is no real explanation for the transition .
it has a plot ,
but once again ,
it is obviously a kid 's movie .
it seems like there are explicit moral lesson of the day
that are being conveyed 
like sesame street or something .
it is bearable .
but much better if you are ,
say 
nine .
