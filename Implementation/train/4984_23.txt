goodnight 
mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england
where the sun always seems to shine .
before we have much idea of the period
we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii .
soon a train blowing cloud of steam ings refugee child from london
and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant 
gruff old tom
( who you just know
will turn out to have a heart of gold )
our tale begins.and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is .
in fact it is just the old odd-couple buddy formula .
are not any new story
being written ?
as i suggested
there is hardly any period feel in the village
and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around .
and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london 's citizen file politely into air-raid shelter .
even when the local schoolteacher 's husband is declared missing presumed killed ,
he is later restored to life.i found `goodnight 
mister tom ' cliched and obvious and john thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronny with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin ' accent.incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reason
that i disliked it
and looking at fellow-imdb reviewer i seem to be in a minority of one .
