there should be a sub-genre in the western
called 'the robert mitchum western ' .
mitchum 's illiant 
idiosyncratic 
usually undervalued western import his film noir persona
to etch some compellingly dark character sketch ,
and ing an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the film of sam peckinpah .
'man with the gun ' is one of his best .
directed by orson welle protege richard wilson ,
it is a stark 
monochrome beauty 
full of chilling silhouette and terrifying outburst of savage violence ,
as mitchum comes
to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army .
mitchum 's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer 
with a host of dark emotion in between 
is a marvel of expressive 
physical acting .
