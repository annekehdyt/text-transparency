a friend of mine bought this
( very cheaply )
and decided to give it to me as a birthday present .
i thought
i would never watch it 'cause i knew
it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic ,
but then my friend and i got really bored
and watched it .
from start till finish !
i know quite an accomplishment
but it really is a masterpiece .
it is hard to describe .
you should see it ,
it is a real lesson on what person are capable of when they believe
they are creative and smart
and really are not .
the `` acting '' is sous-terrain
( you can actually see the `` leading lady '' laugh on some occasion ,
she is definitely the worst ) .
the `` story '' is to stupid to be summed up
and really everything in this film sucked .
please 
pay special attention to `` the sheriff '' .
the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse
to be involved in this .
he is extremely bad as well .
whatever it did have some hilarious moment .
check it out 
haha
