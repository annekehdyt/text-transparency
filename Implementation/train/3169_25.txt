by some happy coincidence the same year
that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock 's haunting masterpiece `` vertigo '' ,
they also made this light comedy .
perhaps the two actor needed to do it
after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film .
at any rate this a great companion piece to `` vertigo ''
as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance .
in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of `` vertigo '' with it is happy ending .
here again novak undergo a transformation ,
in vertigo she essentially plays two woman
and here she 'transforms ' from witch to mortal .
stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her .
unlike vertigo the two come together in `` bell book and candle '' 
a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie .
again the dynamic of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein .
the cast is terrific .
lemmon hilarious as novak 's warlock other and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt .
ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold
playing novak 's competitor
are all great .
the scene with stewart drinking
the potion is comedy at it is best .
anyone
who has seen vertigo or even if
you have not should see this memorable light comedy .
