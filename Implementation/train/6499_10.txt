this film makes `` american pie '' a sophisticated movie !
no further comment needed .
humor is cheap ,
dialogue are stupid
and the cast is awkward .
every clich\u00e9 is used several time
without any original twist .
and far the worst 
the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope .
it is so sad .
