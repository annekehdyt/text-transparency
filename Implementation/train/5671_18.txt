in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv .
dietrich bonhoeffer 's life 
is a true example about a good german and specially 
about a good man .
the conversation between tukur 's character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting .
a true idea ' war :
two different german 
both with faith in there believes .
bonhoeffer was a very complex person :
man 
freedom fighter 
boyfriend 
churchman and a great intellectual ;
ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer .
i recommended this film a lot 
specially in this difficult time for the planet .
in mexico we do not know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy ,
this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero .
