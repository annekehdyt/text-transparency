this early version of the tale 'the student of prague ' was made in germany in 1913 ,
starring paul wegener
( who was also in 'the golem ' a few year later ) .
in this film he plays a dual role
( technically impressive for a 95 year old film
to see them in the same shot )
after meeting a mysterious old man
who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold
he needs to woo a countess
he is previously saved from drowning.moving at a fast pace
( the film runs just over an hour )
and fairly well written and characterised 
'the student of prague ' has echo of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde ,
starting
as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil ,
and developing into good and evil side of the same person .
