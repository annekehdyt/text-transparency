lorne michael once again proves
that he has absolutely no business
producing movie.you
would think
that after such dismal flick `` superstar '' 
`` night at the roxbury '' 
and `` conehead '' 
he had start to get the notion
that maybe he does not know
what he is doing
when it comes to movie
( and many would argue
that he does not know what he is doing
when it comes to television 
as well ) .
trying to make feature film out of skit
that wore out their welcome the third time
the were done on snl
makes no sense.i personally like tim meadow ,
and think
that he would be great in the right movie .
it is a shame
to see a talented guy wasted in a film
that features unfunny after unfunny situation ,
and cap it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene .
any laughs here will be
because the movie is so bad ,
not because it is funny.oh well ,
at least we can be thankful
that there are many other tired snl character
who will never have film done about them .
it is just too bad
that this one made it to the big screen .
