get your ewsky out and enjoy this flawed action flick .
speakman 's considerable kempo skill
( nice spin kick ,
decent with the stick - poor couch ! )
is the only redeeming quality of a movie
that just cries bad acting .
the plot is not half bad ;
just executed pretty poorly .
but if you are seeing this movie for anything other than martial art ,
you are missing the boat entirely .
and for a movie
that is supposed to take place in koreatown ,
way way too few korean actor
( even extras ) .
