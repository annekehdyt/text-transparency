daniel day lewis is one of the best actor of our time and one of my favorite .
it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the character
he plays making them real.i remember ,
many year ago ,
we had a party in our house - the friend came over ,
we were sitting around the table ,
eating ,
drinking the wine ,
talking 
laughing -
having a good time .
the tv was on -
there was a movie
which we did not pay much attention to .
then 
suddenly 
all of us stopped talking and laughing .
the glass did not clink ,
the fork did not move ,
the food was getting cold on the plate .
we could not take our eye off the screen
where the young crippled man
whose entire body
was against him
and who only had a control over his left foot ,
picked up a piece of chalk with his foot
and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor .
when he finished writing that one word 
we all knew
that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit 
the triumph of the cinema
which was able to capture the moment like this on the film 
and the triumph of an actor
who did not act
but who became his character.jim sheridan 's `` my left foot ''
is an riveting 
unsentimental bio-drama about christy brown 
the man
who was born with cereal palsy in a dublin slum ;
who became an artist and a writer
and who found a love of his life.i like every one of day lewis 's performance
( i have mixed feeling about his performance in gony )
but i believe
that his greatest role was christy brown in `` my left foot ''
