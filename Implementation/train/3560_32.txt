i bought this on dvd for my other
who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan .
i decided to watch
it myself
earlier this week.it is a reasonably entertaining piece
containing two completely separate story line .
the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two .
she plays a rising hollywood actress
who has had many short unfulfilling relationship .
she literally bumps into brian kerwin
( a regular married guy with kid )
after driving her car into the back of his .
after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home
as she no longer feel comfortable to drive .
romance develops eventually leading to tragedy
when his wife finds out .
what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot.the other section involves an old studio boss
played by darren mcgavin .
this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan 
lois chile 
steven bauer and stella steven .
they all want something from the studio boss but in the end
when he is asked to resign ,
they all realize
their career will now be going nowhere .
it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me .
i am not a michelle pffeifer fan
but she was admittedly the only actor worth
watching in this film and even in 1983
she was a decent actress .
overall though unless you are a fan of her avoid this
as it is very routine .
