elvira
( cassandra peterson )
is the host of a cheap horror show .
after she finds out
that her dead aunt has left her some stuff ,
elvira goes to england to pick it up ,
hoping it will be some money .
but to her horror 
elvira finds out
that all her aunt has left her is her house 
her dog and a cookbook .
elvira decide to settle in the house anyways ,
but with her striking dark look and her stunning feature ,
she will not be able to live in peace .
all the neighbour are now turning the whole town against her 
and with elvira 's outrageous attitude and look ,
everyone better watch out ,
because elvira is on fire !
i really enjoyed this movie ,
it is really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventure ,
she is just great .
the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood 
sure ,
it is silly
and the joke are cheap
but it is a pleasure
to watch it .
i would give elvira 
mistress of the dark 8/10
