i have seen bad film
but this took the p*** .
made no sense ,
and all the character do is swear every couple of second 
oh and i think
one has a low sperm count .
its that good .
a welshman plays a sweary cockney .
a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy ,
and some lesser light play dim tarts.and there are some russian gangster .
oh yes
some one has a gun and maybe talk rubbish whilst high on drugs.avoid this film like the plague .
