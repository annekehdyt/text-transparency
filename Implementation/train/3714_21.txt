this movie is a must-see movie for all .
congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier ,
as should everyone in america .
the previous reviewer totally missed the point
-- the point is to reveal the truth
about teaching our soldier
to kill person
who are not terrorist ,
but who just live in our `` enemy 's '' territory ,
and what it does to the soldier .
we must support our troop by inging them home immediately ,
before another person is killed or injured .
this also reveals that the government does not help its veteran 
those
who are injured mentally 
with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder 
or physically 
with lost limb .
