it is somewhat telling that most of the great review for the film on imdb all come from person
who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career
and yes you have guessed it ,
that film is `` parasomnia '' .
i have often suspected suspiciously good review on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good film as underhand marketing ,
but it seems fairly transparent in this case.that is not to say
parasomnia is terrible ,
but it stops well short of being the good or great film
it had the potential
to be.on the plus side ,
it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick
who does a illiant job
projecting menacing and evil ,
i could easily see him
having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter .
there are some beautiful visual in the dream sequence ,
in fact if the film had decided to explore
that terrain more it might have been something better .
the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story ,
it is the mark of a good story
that it succeeds in letting you do that .
if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly ,
then the story is losing you
and that is what kept happening to me with this film .
other reviewer have mentioned this here
and i do not want to get into spoiler territory ,
but i will say
the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing ,
not too mention the varying mental age of a character
that is only supposed to have experienced a few year of life.all in all ,
there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism ,
but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special .
