this documantary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing .
i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel .
i think
i will see
if i can order a copy of it on dvd .
the film footage does not look all blurry
and choppy like you might think from 1925 b and w silent film .
set in iran in 1925 ,
the nomadic tribe person in the documantary leave their desert home
and cross a raging river 
man 
woman 
child 
animal ... then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot .
it is sink or swim and climb or die .
in search of grass for their animal .
they have cow 
goat 
dog 
horse 
mule .
in one scene a man is carrying a mule
who is too sick
to climb the mountain .
the child in the documantary all look happy and healthy .
they had such a hard life .
i wonder
if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this .
makes you appreciate modern life in usa .
