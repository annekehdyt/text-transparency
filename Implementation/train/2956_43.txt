everybody 's got bill to pay ,
and that includes christopher walken.in vietnam 
a group a soldier discover
that the war is over
and are heading back home
when they spot a bunch of pow ,
including christopher walken .
following a mad max 3
( ! )
thunderdome fight 
and a short massacre later .
walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.cut to the present
( 1991 ) ,
and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente .
he is successful at first ,
but after el presidente threaten to crush folk with a tank ,
he is forced to surrender
and is shot in the head on live television .
this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly ,
which leads walken to assemble the old squad
( even though he was not actually part of that squad to begin with ) ,
in order to invade colombia and gun down thousand of people.mcbain is a monumentally stupid film ,
but for all
that it is also a good laugh ,
and action packed too .
this is one of those movie
where logic is given a wide berth -
how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane
without suffering from decompression 
or even eaking a window ?
also 
it seems that these guy can gun down score of drug dealer in new york
without the police bothering.there is plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here 
from michael ironside 's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence 
to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the hero 
to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente ,
and let 's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader ,
being watched on television in america
( nearly ought a own tear to my nether-eye ,
that bit ) .it is out there for a quid .
buy it
if you have a sense of humour .
see how many time you can spot the camera crew too .
