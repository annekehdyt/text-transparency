a young boy sees his mother getting killed
and his father hanging himself .
20 year later he gets a bunch of friend together
to perform an exorcism on himself
so he will not turn out like his father .
all the stock character are in place :
the nice couple ; the `` funny '' guy ; the tough
( but sensitive ) hood ;
the smart girl
( she wears glass
-- that is how we know ) ;
the nerd and two no-personality blonde .
it all involves some stupid wooden statue
that comes to life
( do not ask )
and kills person .
i knew i was in trouble
when 
after a great opening scene 
we jump to 20 year later
-- all bad horror movie do
that !
the dialogue is atrocious ,
the acting is bad
( except for betsy palmer --
why betsy ? )
and the killing are stupid and/or unimaginative .
my favorite scene is when two person are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show
he is fully dressed !
a real bad 
stupid incoherent horror film .
avoid at all cost .
