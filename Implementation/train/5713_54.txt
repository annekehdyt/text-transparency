what would you expect from a film titled 'surviving christmas'and
presented as 'festive fun ' 
something like ghandi or english patient ?
there are lot of thing i love about this film ,
it is funny ,
it is very well cast
and it is superbly written .
i came to the film as a kaplan/elfort fan
but was dubious
when i read the plot ,
it sounded ridiculous .
but the film does not come across like that
because affleck
( as drew latham )
plays his part perfectly 
one minute a child-like adult 
the next a mature man
who realises
he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants .
in fact we see latham grow up in this film ,
when he encounters the problem of those
he envies and realises
that their life are not so good ,
he sees
that his own lot is not so bad.this film has fewer weak or dud scene
than many other comedy i have seen .
comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama ,
it either works
or it does not and very few comedy writer get
it correct every time.i particularly loved the drama scene ,
where the family take to reading part written by latham .
the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco
( jame gandolfini )
and the comment of brian valco
( josh zuckerman ) .
it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco
who has to bite his tongue ,
wear silly hat
or sing to the christmas tree
in order to earn the prize money
that keeps the film moving along well.the addition of daughter alicia
( christina applegate )
into the story ings a delightful romantic angle ,
and why not in a christmas film ?
of course its corny and contrived ;
he is rich and handsome ,
she is beautiful and single ,
and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow
and finding themselves face to face .
great !
one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music
to boost the atmosphere
but i can not really complain .
i got what i wanted .
