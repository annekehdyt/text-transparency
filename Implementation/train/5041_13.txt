this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly 
just painfully mediocre .
lacking any real wit or imagination 
a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the `joke '
( which are predictable and threadbare )
are spun out to such inordinate length
that boredom and yawn quickly overtake the viewer .
another notch to mark the sad decline of john water and a reminder
that what `shocked ' or amused us 30 year ago does not work quite the same way now .
we have seen it all before ,
and it no longer eaks any taboos
because they have long since evaporated .
a major miss .
