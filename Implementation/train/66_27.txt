although there is flying guillotine as part of the title of this movie ,
it has no connection to the original flying guillotine
( 1975 )
and its sequel flying guillotine ius
( 1978 ) .
the two original are masterpiece of kung-fu movie
and still stands out as a classic .
this is a much inferior copy of the original ,
and even as a regular kung-fu movie ,
it is below average.first of all ,
this movie does not have much acting .
it is one senseless fight scene after another ,
and flying guillotine does not even play a major part in them .
story is about some shaolin monk
who are tracking down some villain
who 've took off with a sacred book ,
and an evil prince
who owns part of this book
is part of the plot .
the same evil prince has plan
to lure the monk in
and use the flying guillotine on them.there are four movie with flying guillotine as part of its title .
this in my opinion is of least quality .
the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating
that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three.the movie
has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production .
best skip this and watch the two original .
