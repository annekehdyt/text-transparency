i get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughter constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon 
disney and the like .
it all seems to be the same old tired cartoon rehashed over and over again .
when my daughter could not go to the fair this afternoon
because one of them was sick ,
i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while .
i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different 
i flipped the channel .
my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey 's voice .
i adore every single solitary thing
this man has done
and
when i saw
that he was doing voice-over work for a little duck ... well ,
i could not change the channel !
my daughter were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon
and the more we watched the show together ,
the more i grew to love it along with the message
that was being portrayed .
it is not necessarily a proponent for `` gay right '' but rather for anyone
who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything .
i had friend
who were picked on for one thing or another ... . too fat 
too skinny 
too feminine ,
being a bully ,
not being smart enough ,
only having one parent ... .
you name it !
kid 
as a rule 
can be very very cruel to one another
so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon
that actually conveyed a life message to its audience .
my girl already accept other
as they are and do not pick on other for being different .
my older daughter actually stands up for her friend
if they are picked on
( one happens to have a single mom
and that little girl is picked on quite often
-- it warms my heart
when kassie stands up for her !
) .so 
those of you
who are condemning this show
because you feel
that it is an advocate for `` gay right ''
or are being forced to `` accept certain view '' ,
you clearly
and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon.and
if
you need it explained to you ... . well ,
you need more help than any television show
could ever offer .
