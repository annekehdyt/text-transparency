yeah 
unfortunately i came across the dvd of this
and found
that it was incredibly awful.first of all 
the character suck .
i mean 
come on ,
if some dork in an orange hat
who calls himself 'orange sherbert '
is the best creative idea
these guy could come up for a character ,
then they should definitely not be in the film-making scene .
poor `` costume '' 
bad `` interview '' ,
and basically there is not one `` wrestler '' on this whole disc with any shred of charisma.the `` wrestling '' in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiot gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline .
they make sure to giggle together all the while 
too ,
making the experience seem more like a toddler 's playtime than a `` wrestling deathmatch '' .basically ,
splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone .
only 
instead of blood 
weapon 
mayhem 
and wrestling 
we get a trampoline 
giggling kid 
terrible audio ,
and some guy called orange sherbert.wrestling fan or not ,
avoid this dvd .
it is awful .
