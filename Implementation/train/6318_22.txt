i think
this movie is absolutely beautiful .
and i am not referring only to the eathtaking scenery .
it is about two unhappy english housewife
who decide to rent an italian castle
to take a eak from their not so happy home life .
in the end four woman total rent the place together 
all with different personality and different reason
for being there .
in this magically beautiful place
they all find the peace
they are longing for and interestingly
that peace comes from inward reflection and resolution 
more so than without .
i also find it wonderful
because of the relationship
that are developed out kindness and understanding .
the acting is a joy to watch in itself .
i especially love the character of lottie
( josie lawrence )
and lady caroline
( polly walker ) .
