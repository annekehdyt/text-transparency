this is a illiant political satire .
no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s. :
it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.another good film from this era 
rendition ,
was also totally dismissed simply
because it showed 
accurately ,
that the u.s. is a war machine bent on torturing 
murdering 
and maiming civilian in its quest for total world domination.a clever plot 
good acting 
some big star
( john cusack 
ben kingsley 
marisa tomei anyone ? )
and some scene of hilarity should have made this movie a hit .
unfortunately 
american do not like to hear the truth about themselves ,
especially when they are complicit in mass murder .
