if you have a chance
of seeing this film
do see it .
it is quite shocking in part
and really makes you think about so many important issue
but it is not didactic .
in my opinion it is a piece of art ... beautifully filmed 
fine music of many style 
the typically impressive level of acting
that one has come to expect from bbc drama .
nathalie press
( billed as 'natalie ' press )
is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate .
celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality
that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge
that someone out there
is actually 'normal ' ,
but the real star
as always is timothy spall -
surely one of the greatest actor of our time !
