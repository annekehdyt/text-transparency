this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reason .
1 ) perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking ,
but no man left alone on an asteroid for year would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android .
2 ) it was not an android at all 
but a woman 
the beautiful jean marsh.the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decade could have traced its origin back to this episode
if they had done it properly .
in fact 
the modernization of sex-bot are in the news
as i speak.robot were not new to movie or television
when this episode was made ,
so they could have at least had her act like one .
her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element .
instead 
it becomes a nice little love story about two human on faraway star.the twilight zone
always stretched the imagination and credulity .
normally no one cared .
but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing
what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine 
or downright carelessness .
