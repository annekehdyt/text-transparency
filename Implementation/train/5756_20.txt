i do not give much credence to aid conspiracy theory
but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized .
in the early year of the aid epidemic 
the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasy .
this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of san francisco .
the city 
renowned for its beauty 
has rarely appeared uglier than in this film .
a sense of darkness and decomposition pervade every scene.while the acting and plot can not be said to be well-done the film unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss .
actually 
i found the most interesting performance
to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish 
lesbian
( ? )
polouse detective .
she is interesting ,
though not necessarily convincing.highlight :
the film 's use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif
and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist 
ron athey .
