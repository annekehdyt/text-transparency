my name is modesty is a low-budget film
that tells the story of the origin of modesty blaise .
it is not that the movie is terrible ,
it is just not what i was expecting or hoping for .
while i have been aware of the modesty blaise character for year ,
i am not overly familiar with the comic strip or the graphic novel ,
so i am coming into this movie as something as an outsider .
that may be part of the reason for my disappointment .
i was expecting more action and more comedy .
the film is dialogue driven .
i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value .
as it is ,
my name is modesty is a deathly serious film .
there are very few 
if any 
`` light '' moment .
the acting 
at least from alexandra staden 
is acceptable but nothing outstanding .
as other have commented ,
she does appear a little too frail
to be completely believable in the title role .
what action scene
there are in my name
is modesty are one of the film weakest point .
i never bought into the notion
that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.i
really hope
quentin tarantino goes ahead
and makes the rumored a big budget film
based on the modesty blaise character .
i am convinced
the concept has a lot of potential
and i would very much look forward to it .
