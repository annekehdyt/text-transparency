a real blow-up of the film literally .
this british film is boringly made.what an exciting plot !
a terrorist place bombs on a train .
how could the writer and producer of this stinker turn this into such a dull story ? glenn ford ,
as the expert called upon
to defuse the bomb ,
is given awful writing material
to work with .
naturally ,
just as he is called in ,
his wife 
anne vernon 
is about to leave him .
no wonder we never heard of miss vernon .
after such a film 
it would be enough to end her career.that elderly man
who loved train
and interfere
is our 1953 version of senile dementia .
i thought
it was highly insulting to show this man 
even at the end .
