this was my second time watching the film
( via the french-language version as opposed to the first ,
which was dubbed in italian )
and i feel
that it improves on subsequent viewings.a compelling
if slowly built-up character study
that is beautifully shot and with the parisian setting
being equally impressive .
in the long run 
it is not top-grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography
but it is still a confident mix of subtle chill and 
surprisingly 
often oad comedy .
it also features a fine cast ,
all of whom are in good form 
but especially isabelle adjani 
melvyn dougla and jo van fleet.even so ,
i am a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to 'change ' into the previous tenant ;
apart from the owner of the caf\u00e9 opposite the apartment building ,
where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him
if he wished any different ,
there is little to indicate
( as far as i could discern 
anyway )
that this is what everybody wanted of him !
okay 
so he found simone 's belonging still lying in the apartment
but what exactly drove him to wear her dress
and make himself up as her (
even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously ) ?
following his nightmarish vision in the bathroom 
the last section of the film
( where adjani all but disappear )
is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene
where the landlord and the other tenant witness his attempted suicide
as if it were a night at the opera 
a concept
which had already been used 46 year earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet
( 1930 ) !
the ending 
then 
is at once predictable and unresolved :
just what made the two occupant of this particular apartment jump out of the window ? !
; i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well ,
and i am sorry to say
it is no clearer now !
mind you 
the film 's first two-third are pretty solid
but i wish
that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot point throughout .
