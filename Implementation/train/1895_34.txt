an unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho thug during a night-time encounter on a forest road in shropshire 
england .
the man and woman
who were assaulted plan
and carry out a revenge attack on their attacker ...
utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash 
somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking ' drama ,
whilst actually coming across as sub-michael winner cr*p
( you just know
that oliver reed and susan george would have been cast had it
so easily have been made in the 1970s ) .
what happens to alice
( gillian anderson )
and adam
( danny dyer )
is appalling and devastating ,
yet dan reed somehow manages to rub the viewer 's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness .
his camera lingers hungrily on anderson 's naked body both during and after the assault 
whilst the script leaves almost all the character floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional clich\u00e9 .
his script forces his character to behave in such a way
as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victim '
by shoving more ghastly situation into their faces
( adams 's attempted post-incident assault on both sophie and alice ;
alice 's assault on heffer after his suicide-attempt confession )
.the quandary comes from the central protagonist ' performance - dyer is a horrible actor 
incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault
( he will end up in eastender ,
mark my word ) ,
but anderson is extraordinary .
even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous way ,
she somehow deliver an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self-indulgent 
arrogant hedonist
who encounters such horror and need to retaliate.a vile and pointless film then ,
almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance .
