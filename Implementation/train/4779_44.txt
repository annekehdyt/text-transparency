at the point in time
that the lady from shanghai was being made ,
the marriage of orson welle and rita hayworth was disintegrating .
the film was as much an effort by welle
to rekindle the old flame
as it was to make a classic noir .
not received well at the time ,
the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as year pass .
gotten better with age so to speak.welle is irish seaman michael o'hara
who on a fateful night
rescues the beautiful rita hayworth from three mugger in central park .
spark do fly ,
but then comes the rub ,
turns out
the lady is married to crippled 
but illiant criminal attorney everett sloane .
nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welle
and hires him to skipper his yacht.so far this film is starting to sound a lot like gilda .
if orson had seen gilda
and was not at this point thinking with his male member ,
he would have skedaddled back to the seaman 's hiring hall in lower manhattan .
instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue
and finds himself pegged for two murder and sloane as his eminent counsel.welle for whatever reason decided
that his wife would be a blond in this film .
supposedly harry cohn hit the roof
as rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair .
this may have soured him on the picture
as he joined the legion of studio boss
who saw welle 's vision of independent film
making a threat to their power.stage actor glenn ander plays sloane 's partner grisby
who is one slimy dude ,
he winds up a corpse .
the other corpse
to be here
is ted decorsia 
a bottom feeding private detective
who tries to go in business for himself.it
is a good noir thriller ,
showing rita at her glamorous best
even if she was a blond here .
the final shoot out in the hall of mirror is beautifully staged ,
but i would not recommend seeing
it
if one is on any controlled substance .
