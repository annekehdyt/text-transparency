yes 
i sat through the whole thing ,
god knows why.it was a long afternoon ,
i had nothing to do ,
it was bitterly cold outside 
okay ,
those are all lame excuse but they are the only one i have.i gave the darkling 4 star out of a possible 10 - i have seen worse film ,
but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom
-- poor script 
poor acting 
bad lighting 
and cheesy special effects.the storyline ,
which never completely makes sense ,
revolves around this simple little family 
daddy 
mommy 
and little girl
--
that i assume
the viewer is supposed to be `` identifying '' with ,
all three of them were tedious and annoying .
you just want the dark side
to get every one of them.daddy
is a cook
whose hobby is car .
daddy meets a rich man
named rubin
who collects car
and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the `` mysterious '' orient .
rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refer to it as `` the darkling '' .
during the course of the film 
the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different thing :
a shadow
without a person ,
the inner darkness
that exists in all of us 
and the devil .
so take your pick of whichever one of those explanation suit your fancy
-- because trust me ,
it does not really matter.the darkling 's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion --
it gets a human companion --
and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being .
this 
of course 
leads to immense wealth ,
followed by disaster ,
for the human
who hooks up with the darkling.and for the rest of us
-- it just leads to a very long 
tedious movie .
