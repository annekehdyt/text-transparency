to start off with ,
since this movie is a remake of a classic ,
the rating has to be lowered already .
since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski 
it helps.is not this just like the united states government though ,
to terrorize one of its own citizen .
sound like jason priestley 's character from the movie !
but it is the truth ,
the government would do anything possible
to destroy a man 's life
for trying to get home to his wife .
a wife ,
who is in labor no less ,
and may not make it .
`` there was a time in this country
that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife . ''
the word of the disc jockey.there were some great shot of scenery in this film 
and great car chase and a lot of spirituality .
after much consideration ,
i gave this film a 7 .
