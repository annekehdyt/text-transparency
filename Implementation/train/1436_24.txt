humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film ,
and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended .
believe me ,
he made the wrong choice !
presumably 
after the success of `` dodge city '' 
warner tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddy 
like alan hale 
guinn
( big boy )
williams 
frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel ,
but they made the huge mistake
of trying to present miriam hopkin as a love interest for flynn v. randolph scott ,
and as a singer to really make thing bad ,
because she proved one thing ,
and that is she can not sing .
the story was not too bad ,
but with bogie clearly miscast also ,
it turned out to be a poor western
that was overlong ,
and on a low budget 
but in fairness 
color would not have helped .
