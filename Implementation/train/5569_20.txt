i remember watching this as a child in the uk 
mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier 's narration .
we would talk about nothing else at school the next day .
i imagine the rating for the first showing were huge .
this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series
despite the fact
they had to cut the story down to the bone
they managed to capture so much .
what is interesting is that the battle of britain and north africa were pivotal
yet are widely unrecognized as such by american .
the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american general 
the suffering of german troop on the eastern front 
the maltreatment of japanese prisoner of war by american troop .
the image of the holocaust made me 
a non-jewish european 
feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish person .
i do not know
why this is not number one in the imdb ranking .
perhaps they are showing their bias against documentary .
spoiler - we win .
