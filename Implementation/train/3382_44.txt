this is how i felt
while watching this film .
i loved it .
it was hilarious .
but i did feel
a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody 's psyche and then laughing
as it got twisted around
to make an interesting point .
a friend put it this way : ''
i feel
like we oke into somebody 's house
and are now watching their awful home video
without their knowledge ''
.another one of those fact is stranger than fiction piece of film .
`` groovin ' gary '' 
the original `` beaver kid '' 
is a small town guy
who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope
of getting on film -
and he certainly does 
though not 
perhaps ,
as he initially expected .
with high hope of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest
that he has organised in his home town -
headlined by his own drag act `` olivia newton-don '' .
director 
trent harris 
does a illiant job with this slowly evolving story .
some footage of an awkward kid
who wants to be someone morphs ,
over two subsequent reinterpretation 
into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america .
harris simultaneously critiques the attitude of small town america 
the cult of celeity 
and the exploitative practice of the film and television industry.both sean penn and grispin glover pull out stunner performance .
a young sean penn is the most evocative -
so closely does he follow the actual 'gary footage ' 
but with strong nuance
given to push the sense of the interaction the way
harris wants it to go.in the end
the wide-eyed naivety the original gary is what moved me -
when contrasted against these possible interpretation of his situation.a film not to miss .
i have not seen anything else like it.jacob .
