first this deserves about 5 star due to acting
( some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one
as it should by giving this one 
well deserved 
star )
but then i know
that those fact are used for the actor
( s )
names to increase the rating of something like this ... i do have a problem with such production ;
yet another attempt
( just like `` untraceable '' )
of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your right
( how interesting that it comes at a moment
when ips provider trying to `` preferentiate '' = censor information ,
and the american and canadian are fighting against that at this very moment ) .
this time is not by labeling torrent file transfer as evil
( that one was intended to remind you of such feeling
whenever you transfer datum on the net ) ,
but by literally attempting
in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole .
seems like fear promotion is hollywood 's norm this day ,
especially when coming to thriller
which is the most `` on demand '' motion picture genre for past 2 decade or so = most viewed ,
best way to try influence the society as a whole .
such level of violence are depicted in this 2 feature of morally and `` ethical '' person ,
that it gives a new much needed meaning to `` anti-heroes '' figure .
make no mistake ,
this is not `` dexter ''
which was meant to be high-quality entertainment.stop selling `` fear '' please ,
the world would be a better place
without it and the dollar made of it.the opening scene
and generally the first 10 minute really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage
that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration .
the way
he handles the black male
is very disturbing if not outright racist
( for sure a `` cliche '' at least )
( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it ,
you will see what i mean ) .
the second scene
( with claire dane 's character present )
is even more extreme .
at that point i realized 
in my opinion
that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to person around him.how many person ,
that have seen or will see this movie ,
have never been `` hold down ''
( regarding both sex )
out of self 
common gratification !
? .typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case
( that unfortunately did ,
is and will likely happen again sometime 
somewhere )
but fingers everyone else indirectly as well
as `` you could become that '' 
etc .
anyone
that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well
that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone `` ass '' 
by such fanatical `` hero '' here .
safe sex in its many form is healthy and not some evil
that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with 
on his way for some sexual `` crusade '' .
have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandal
involving priest and young boy ! ?
or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on `` pg-13 ''
but he can not even see a woman east until `` r-18 '' ! ? ! ?
( yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversion like `` american pie '' series for example )
.raise the kid tester-one level but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetish to unhealthy extreme ! ?
all sexual activity
( upon mutual acceptance )
integrates individual better then some `` rightous '' nut-case ,
that blames his misfortune and shortcoming on `` the life of other ''
( a new german movie
that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart feature on the very same subject ) .here 
like in that movie 
you will probably appreciate the actor for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been.i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent `` hunting party '' 
a feature
where he really shine and about a more realistic `` hero ''
( after real fact as well )
.but then it just reminds me
that all those person are only actor
that get paid to play someone 's political and social agenda .
`` the flock '' and `` untraceable '' 2 head of the same hidden beast ) ) )
it just reminds you ,
if know anyone with similar view on the subject as a whole ,
as erroll babbage has those here ,
to stay clear of them for their own safety.they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chance of paul jerrod in anyone 's life would ... in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my `` assment '' of this particular movie
( and `` untraceable '' actually ) ,
so you can likely have similar thought as i did .
nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the `` foot '' .
) ) ) )
for once i agree with the rating ,
this is not a feature for teenager or kid ;
simply because at best would confuse them even more then the `` common '' belief of `` money+fame+fashion ''
and how that relates to sexuality .
`` scream '' series and movie as such at least have a defined entertainment value
( even if a dumb one in my opinion ) .
but this one is just another `` trust me i know
what is good for you '' deeply
( not so well done i might add )
subliminal message .
