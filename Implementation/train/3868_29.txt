this is a case of a bunch of person
thinking
they are so clever
they have a story
that fits the time .
remember
the all-around political conspiracy caught on camera in the year leading to the watergate and a little later ?
most movie
trying to cash in on made-for-tv 'o so powerful ,
o so mind numbing ' conspiracy were in fact
caught in their own navel-gazing attitude.i
was never a fan of the conversation
which i find as much dated as other conspiracy stint of the time
but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe .
i mean these conspiracy movie are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir hero .
lot of question unanswered 
lot of dis-communication ... well this takes at least bergman
to build a movie about such un-visual bases.the next man is a perfect example of its time :
one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him .
neither part is interesting in itself
and the whole does not get any better .
in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequence piling up 'watcha that ' murder
without ever advancing any storyline .
pedestrian
directing at its worst
as most of the movie
is one pompous accumulation of scene
revolving around violence naively
ought under the viewer 's eye .
