so 
neighbor was killing neighbor .
remind me of iraq .
as i watched the american flag
( 50 star in 1864 ? )
being dragged behind the horse ,
i realized why burning
that piece of red white and blue does not upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of right .
i am a southerner ,
and must have some historical memory.watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave ,
as he looks at the scalps of black and german
( his ethnic background )
being wagered at a poker game ... ..was interesting .
many twist in this movie .
the wife ,
who is forced into her marriage ,
shows both lust and a strong will ,
characteristic we are not used
to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles'.the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin 
head of the copeland horse-thieving gang 
inc. in mississippi 
was hung about that time .
band of homeless man were roaming the countryside 
armed .
remind you of iraq ?
and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background ?
and why southerner are still fighting that civil war today.too bad we can not use
that same knowledge in our handling of the country we have just invaded
and are occupying 
fomanting civil war everywhere .
that is mesopotamia ,
now called iraq ,
who happen to have the misfortune
to sit on oil .
the wild-eyed killer in missouri 
raiding lawrence 
kansas could as easily be the insurgent
we are fighting now with no success.another anomaly was the father 's tribute to the yankee
who move into lawrence and erect a school
`` even before they erect a church .
and for that reason 
they will win . ''
huh ? ? ? ? ?
i was taught history in birmingham ,
al
and we were taught
that the north was much more industrial and richer ...
..that is why they won .
course 
they also literally had god on their side .
as you see here ,
when the freed slave indicates
that he is cutting out to free his mother ,
sold into slavery in texas .
god 
what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.acting pretty good 
lot of blood and gore as the warrior ride gleefully into battle
( but did not hear any rebel yell ,
so reminiscent of football game in alabama ) .
you also get a real feeling
for how stupid the war was 
as the bushwacker and jayhawker gather their force for another raid .
they have lost sight of why
they are fighting ,
and so do we .
just more mindless slaughter.you are also ought up to date with the limbless kid coming home from iraq 
as the bushwacker
( ahh 
what connotation )
first has his arm seared shut ,
trying to save it ,
then has it amputated 
and then dy .
so much suffering for such a stupid cause.the cinematography is fantastic .
now i have to get back to the dvd
and get the production note 
one of my favorite part of any movie .
i suspect
that this movie was written by a gore vidal ,
as the spoken language is of a type
you would associate with that era ,
if you knew history .
the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking .
not your ordinary blood and gut war movie 
by any mean .
you see the wounded but still active-duty soldier ,
still fighting cause
they have nothing else to do .
you see the southern raider ,
living off the land 
stealing indiscriminately .
yet 
at the beginning 
you have seen the battle stop ,
so the woman could be evacuated from danger .
as i read the escalating number of woman and child dying in iraq ,
i am thinking ,
`` where did we lose our sense of honor as a person ? ''
i have forgotten
why i sought this movie out
and bought it after 20 year ,
but some book somewhere lauded it .
with good reason .
tobey at his best 
pre-spideyman .
buy the dvd or rent it .
and tell me why other laud this 
not just liberal cest moi .
