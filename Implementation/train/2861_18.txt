working at a video store i get to see quite a few movie and on occasion i
try to watch some of the not so big movie .
proud happened to be one of them .
the initial idea
of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during wwii had some merit .
however in less than 10 minute of watching the movie
you find out
that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii .
the underlying story is about the ship 
the crew and their exploit in the war .
this primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie .
i command the man
that served on the uss mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardship
that they endured .
a movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishmants these man did for themselves 
the navy and for their country
and not making a movie
whose focus is racism during wwii .
