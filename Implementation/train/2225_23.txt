`` sundown :
the vampire in retreat '' is a rubbish.the acting
is terrible ,
the atmosphere is non-existent
and the character are uninteresting.the only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the imdb user gave it a 10.this is really horrifying.no gore 
no suspense 
no violence 
nothing.bruce cambell
( `` the evil dead '' 
'' intruder '' )
is completely wasted ,
the supporting cast is also terrible.yes 
some person may like this picture 
especially a mainstream society
but hard-core horror fan or gore-hound will not enjoy this piece of crap.personally i hate horror comedy 
i prefer watching serious horror movie like `` cannibal holocaust '' or `` last house on the left '' .in my opinion ,
a real horror movie is supposed to be scary 
excessively bloody and disturbing ,
without stupid humour ,
which usually ruins the whole concept.this one is not scary ,
is not gory ,
is not even funny as a comedy ,
so do not waste your precious time .
