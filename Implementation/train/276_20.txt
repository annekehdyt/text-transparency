gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime .
a bit slow moving
( especially around the middle of the series ) ,
but over all enjoyable .
now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a `` winger '' ,
i will admit
that i have watched all of the original gundam 
gundam 0080 and 0083 
the 08th ms team 
and gundam seed.i will admit
that there were a few problem with the story telling
and a few character may seem to be `` rip-offs ''
( i.e .
zechs marquise to the original gundam 's char ) ,
but this is an alternate universe show
based on the original series ,
as is seed.if you wish to view this series make sure
that you watch the original gundam first ,
and then know
that you are watching an au series .
