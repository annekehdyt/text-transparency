i have loved this movie ever
since it is debut in 1981 !
i have lost track
of how many time i have seen it !
it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up
if i am feeling down .
the three lead are fantastic
and the script is priceless ,
plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song ?
i think
i quote this movie
without realizing it .
i basically know the entire script ,
so
when someone is watching it for the first time i
have to hold back
saying
something about how funny the next line it .
i can not even narrow it down 
although ,
sir john 's character probably gets the most memorable one .
the famous `` i will alert the medium ''
when arthur announces his intention
to take a bath
is still priceless ,
but the list is truly endless .
the scene 's at arthur 's soon
to be fianc\u00e9 's father 's house
are a scream 
particularly his interaction with the moose .
do yourself a favour and see this movie !
