while `` the kiss of the spider woman '' cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country ,
this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country .
specifically 
the dictator suddenly drops dead ,
so julia replace el presidente with a broadway actor
( richard dreyfuss )
shooting a movie in the country .
from there 
dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator ,
all the while balancing it with his own life.is it appropriate
to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy ?
well 
`` moon over parador '' does a good job with it .
no matter what they do in this movie ,
they pull it off .
it just goes to show
why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actor of our era ,
and what we lost
when raul julia died .
definitely worth seeing .
also starring sonia braga
( who co-starred with raul julia in `` tkotsw '' ) ,
jonathan winter and sammy davis jr.i agree :
the first lady is hot .
