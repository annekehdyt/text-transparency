some unrealistic movie spoiler included.from real life experience 
this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning .
i am currently deployed on my second tour to iraq as an infantry man .
this film has nothing near
what would happen in real life occurrence .
from the very start to name a few :
the bomb cart 
the eod element rolling out solo with no escort 
the eod staff sergeant sneaking of vbc ,
having sleeve rolled the entire time in acus ,
to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy 
the sniper scene .
the list would continue 
however ,
it is unnecessary to list thing wrong happening with a time span of 2 minute
before more thing were incorrect ;
and the point was made.this movie is for person and critic to watch
that have no understanding or experience with deployment or the military.person with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy .
