today 
i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll
and hollywood.hollywood has produced movie
based on one of the darkest day of our nation .
911 changed everything .
it changed our perception of security .
it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity .
most importantly and devastatingly ,
it changed our world.however ,
i can not not stress how utterly repulsed 
disillusioned 
and angry i am at the careless 
blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction .
this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoer and critic alike ;
most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press .
hollywood has sunk to a new low .
even lower than the low-down bastard
who perpetrated the most barbaric act of savagery and unrelenting cruelty .
behind it all is uwe boll .
i am very angry at this movie .
how dare they disrespect the memory of family of those lost ?
how dare they mock the life of the ave man and woman
who risked their life to save those
trapped in the doomed tower on that fateful day of infamy ? ! ? ! ?
how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world ? ! ? ! ? !
how ... dare ... they ?
to those
who have the gall to even think
of seeing this morally appalling travesty ,
i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength :
remember .
think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person .
think back to that day ,
ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the life
lost on that day .
think back to that day of the outcry of family of loved one .
think back to that day of the life lost on those two plane .
think back to the further carnage
it caused following the attacks.ask yourself
if you have a soul.think .
remember .
respect the memory of the life lost on 911
by not seeing this film at all .
