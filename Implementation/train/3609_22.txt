this film has great acting 
great photography and a very strong story line
that really makes you think
about who you are ,
how you define yourself ,
how you fit in ,
whether you accept to play a role or eak free ...
there already are excellent comment dealing with these aspect .
i want to comment on the formal setting of the film .
basically 
it is two person on a roof .
there is unity of place and time 
with 2 protagonist ,
and the radio acting as the choir .
many director have turned greek tragedy into film ,
many director have filmed contemporary story
as if they were a greek tragedy ,
but no director 
in my opinion 
has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola
in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedy both in story line and formal setting .
a masterpiece .
