this has to be 
by far 
the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 year .
when i saw
that michael madsen was in it i figured
it could not be too bad a movie
since he has been in some pretty decent film ,
and he was a pretty fair actor .
wrong !
no one should waste their time on this film .
i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i do not feel
that i missed a thing .
