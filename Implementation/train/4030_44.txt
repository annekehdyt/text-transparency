rather foolish attempt at a hitchcock-type mystery-thriller 
improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology
and based on the robin cook novel ;
incidentally 
i \u2019 ve recently acquired another adaptation of his work \u2013 coma
( 1978 )
\u2013 in honor of the late richard widmark .
for the record 
director schaffner had just made the boy from brazil
( 1978 )
\u2013 a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and 
unfortunately 
sphinx was a false step
from which his so-far impressive career would not recover.despite its scope and reasonably decent cast 
however 
this one proved a critical and commercial flop \u2013
mainly because the narrative just isn \u2019 t very thrilling :
in fact 
it \u2019 s quite dreary
( feeble attempt at horror \u2013 the archaeologist heroine
having to put up with entombment 
rotting corpse galore 
and even an attack by a flurry of bat \u2013 notwithstanding ) .
lesley anne-down is the lovely leading lady 
stumbling upon a lost treasure \u2013
it \u2019 s actually been hidden away by a local sect
to prevent it from falling into the hand of foreigner ,
who have appropriated much of the country \u2019 s heritage
( under the pretext of culture )
for far too long .
sir john gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer
who puts down on the way of the loot ,
and pays for this \u2018 act of treason \u2019 with his life.typically 
it transpires
that some character are the opposite of what they claim to be \u2013 so that apparent ally
( such as maurice ronet )
are eventually exposed as villain ,
while an ambiguous figure
( frank langella ,
whom i saw at london in early 2007 in a west end performance of \u201c frost/nixon \u201d ,
which has now been turned into a film )
goes from down \u2019 s antagonist to her lover and back again ,
as he determines to keep the wealth
belonging to egyptian high priest menephta a national treasure .
