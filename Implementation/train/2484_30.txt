in my case i liked this movie
because when i saw
it i
found more than i expected .
i mean 
this is one of the few animated movie
that made me think about its theme even long after i finished .
it talks about death 
vengeance and hell in such a way
that it gets to you like a punch in your face ,
even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid-point of the film .
that is what makes this movie so good :
the ability 
unique in don bluth
( director ) ,
to play with the person 's feeling
and make them love or hate a character in no time .
that 
and the fact
that it has so many good character like charlie and ann-marie ,
that in the sad but happy ending you have to say
`` i have something in my eye ''
to hide the other
that you cried .
all i have said
are just only some of the good point of this movie .
as for the rest 
you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest .
don bluth 
thank you .
