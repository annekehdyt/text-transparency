i really do not get how person made this film
and thought
it was worth all the work
they put into it .
even more puzzling are those
who watched this film
without feeling cheated out of 88 minute
of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus .
first of all 
surely
they could have 2 found real irish person 
and some good-looking woman
who could deliver their line better than the washed up ,
haggard porn star sprinkled throughout this film .
granted 
the gore works- but strangely 
it is not as troubling
as you might think to see organ yanked out of the porn star ' hot
( formerly )
tight body left and right .
probably has something to do with the fact
that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.so ,
if you do not care at all about the following :
- acting
( seriously ,
everyone sucked .
i have never witnessed this before .
everyone sucked )
.-plot
( some crappy horror movie are remotely linear 
or at the very least surprising .
this movie does not make sense
unless you are as trashed as the writer obviously were ) .
- theme
( nothing to learn from this film .
nothing to be scared about in bed at night ,
nothing to contemplate or grasp 
or explain to other ) .
- soundtrack
( crap 
crap 
crap .
music as ordinary and dull as the script ) .
- scenery
( could have been this film 's saving grace ,
but no ... nothing pleasing here .
even the rock are fake )
.so 
yeah .
if you do not care about that ,
and you are just a horny teen with bad taste in music and `` woman 
''
this movie is for you .
positive comment :
interesting cinematography at time 
wasted on the other element .
very realistic gore ; again 
wasted .
but the intestine scene is classic .
i agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem .
