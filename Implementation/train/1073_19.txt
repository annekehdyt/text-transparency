this movie was not awful
but it was not very good .
i am a big fan toni collette i think
she is a very beautiful and talented actress .
the movie starts off about robin william
who is a writer
and gets a book from a 14 year old kid .
the book is great
and he can not't believe a kid wrote it .
toni collette plays the kid guardian
who you do not know
if this kid really exists
or if she is making it all up .
i am not gon na ruin the movie
but i will say
this the movie is not scary.the acting is pretty good
and toni collette 's performance was awesome as well as robin william .
the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i
would wait for it to come to dvd .
