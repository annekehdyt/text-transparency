at first i did not did not like it that much ,
although i did .
they did not include the third trueba generation 
the love between blanca and pedro wans't well explained and some actor were too different from what i had imagined.later i realized
that 
had the movie been more loyal to the book ,
it would have been like five hour long ,
and would be kind of tedious .
now i like it very much ,
because my favourite character are there as i portraited them .
clara really looks like an angel in live ,
and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic 
loyal and short .
glenn close is ferula .
i pictured her just like that 
only not in mourning throughout the whole thing .
esteban is find enough .
i never really liked his character ,
and ,
although i was interested in him 
i hated him a lot 
more specially
when he hit clara .
as in the book 
the very last part is the most exciting one ,
and it has real history
too there.the movie is really good ,
specially considering
that it was a gringo film
based upon a latin american book .
its amazing how many famous star are there ,
do not you think so ?
