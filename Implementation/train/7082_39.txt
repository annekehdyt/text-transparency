i always thought
person were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy film .
a couple of them were not bad .
modern film critic are not one
who usually prefer nice to nasty ,
so goody-two shoe movie like these rarely get praisenonetheless ,
i can not defend this movie either .
you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story .
watching this ,
you just shake your head ask yourself ,
`` how stupid can you get ? ''
this is cornier than corny ,
if you know what i mean .
it is so corny i can not fathom too many person
actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half.the story
basically is `` andy ''
( mickey rooney )
trying to get out of jam
because he makes up some story
about involved with some d\u00e9butante from new york city
as if that was the ultimate .
person were a lot more social-conscious in the old day .
you would hear the term `` social-climber ''
as if knowing rich or beautiful person
was the highest achievement
you could make it life .
it is all utter nonsense 
of course ,
and looks even more so today.however ,
it is about as innocent and clean a story and series
( there were a half dozen of these andy hardy film made )
as you could find .
also ,
if you like to hear judy garland sing ,
then this is your ticket ,
as she sings a couple of song in here
and she croons her way into andy 's heart .
oh man 
i almost throw up even writing about this !
