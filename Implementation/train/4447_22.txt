love trap is not a short ,
it is quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes.while i
am writing this ,
i might as well talk a bit more about love trap .
i am frequently asked what makes love trap different ... this is how i respond to that question :
1 )
it introduces character - one in particular -
that have never been seen before in film 
period.2 )
it reveals more truth about love 
and delves more deeply into the very concept of love 
than any other u.s. film ever made 
in my humble opinion.3 ) structurally ,
as in the way
the story is told ,
it is unlike any love story you have ever seen.4 )
it offers extremely timely insight on various cultural issue 
both within and outside the black community.over time ,
person will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era 
delightfully refreshing 
authentic and honest .
it is a rare morality play full of food for thought.please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate info about this film .
