this movie is actually funny !
if you would like to rest your ain for an hour
so then go ahead
and watch it .
it is called blonde and blonder ,
so do not expect profound and meaningful joke .
what this movie and enjoy all the stereotype we have about two blonde .
it is just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friend
( especially if you are not too sober .
lol ) pamela and denise are still pretty hot chick .
it is a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art .
c'mon 
this movie is about blonde !
it is supposed to be light 
funny and superficial .
one more thing 
i do not think
that girl will appreciate and like this movie
but guy definitely will .
