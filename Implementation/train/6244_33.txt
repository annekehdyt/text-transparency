i can not say
this is one of the best film i
have ever seen .
but then again 
i can not say
it is one of the worst i have ever seen.ok ,
so it is basically a girl does skating ,
is good at it ,
wants to go to an expensive school ,
can not afford it
and has to take a hockey scholarship .
she has to hide her skating secret from her friends.personally ,
i did not like the actress playing katelin .
she absolutely could not cry to save her life 
just made wailing sound 
like a toddler pretending to cry
to get it is own way.katelin
was just an annoying person .
the way she tried to act all nice and helpful to person .
also the part where the two skater are calling her name
and they say something about her choreographer
and she says
she 'draws the line ' made me cringe.we all knew
where it was going to go with her and spencer .
classically they did not like each other and sort of get together at the end
was just typical.overall ,
i think
this is a movie
to watch
if you like skating
but if you do not mind the main skater
being extremely annoying .
it is good to kill time basically .
