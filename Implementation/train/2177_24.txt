the delivery of some very humorous rude line by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission .
he plays a kind of `` jame bond 's psycho twin other '' 
separated at birth 
no doubt .
as an intense hit-man 
his character is very sexual but even better 
very funny .
add the kind-hearted ,
uber-likable american `` guy next door ' 
greg kinnear ,
to set up contrast .
the myriad location 
vivid color 
and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment .
hope davis is well cast as the `` gem of a wife '' .
but the focus of the film is on the two fellow 
a new `` odd couple '' ,
and that is the part
that works very well .
have a great
( probably r-rated )
laugh ,
and look for the place
where the story goes a little deeper .
