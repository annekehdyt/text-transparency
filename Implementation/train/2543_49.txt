ok 
i am not japanese .
i do know a little about japanese culture 
and a little less about japanese pop culture .
other than that 
i am spanish 
i eat paella and i like black humor.good ,
with that point set 
i can comment on the movie :
i have no idea
on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audience ,
mamoru oshii is quite a good director-
despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head ,
and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised
he came up with this .
it may just be one of those lost-in-translation case ,
i am afraid it is ,
but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitle i just thought
it was horrible .
the joke seemed bad ,
the script was overcooked- i mean ,
give the audience a eak ,
and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point
of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced
speaking and absurd action.however ,
i thought
the animation was really cool .
the idea is great ,
and it is well exploited in those animated scene .
however 
the eye-candy finish as soon as the character are left aside
to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still picture .
it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical character
scene.i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this .
the idea was good but horribly exploited .
maybe the second part will ing up the good part of this first one
and actually make an interesting movie ,
or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scene .
but hell ,
if you thought
talking head
was dense ,
amazing lifes of fast food gifter will give cause you a stroke.of course ,
all this comment is based on the experience of someone
who is european .
probably this is totally useless to japanese person ,
maybe it was a really funny film
lost in cultural frontier and translation .
maybe .
