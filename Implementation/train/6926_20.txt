i recently viewed manufactured landscape at the seattle international film festival .
i was drawn to the movie as a photographer
because i am both familiar and a fan of burtynsky 's work .
while i believe
the movie does a good job
getting
it is message across ,
i could not help but feel
that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by burtynsky .
obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs
featuring zoom and pan across them .
while this is a good effect
when used economically ,
i felt
like 75 % of the movie was just stills from burtynsky 's book
( which i already own ) .
that is probably an exaggeration ,
but that is how i felt .
if you own the book or are familiar with his work
you might be better off skipping this one .
