i am too old to know
( or care )
exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is .
and 
being canadian 
it is likely that i have never actually seen mtv ,
but i am not certain.but i thought
this film was very funny
when i saw it 
a ight little satire .
hip-hop culture is so pervasive these day
that it is difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over .
( if only we could say the same about bagpipe music . )
i got most of the joke
( at least i think
i did ) .
sure 
it is derived from spinal tap ,
but there are lot of target
that could stand a tap treatment .
just not the carpenter ,
they are sacred .
