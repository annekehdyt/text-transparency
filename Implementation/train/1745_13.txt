this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti-nuke film out of the 1980s.the idea
that a kid and a basketball star could `` change the world '' is pretty far-fetched ,
given how many `` child 's peace march '' and `` celeity protest '' there were and are.but the idea
that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament ,
because some apparatchik kid
learned of a `` silent protest '' in the west ,
is ludicrous.what ended the cold war ?
america 's tough 
dare i say `` reaganesque '' stance and the internal failure of socialism .
it was not the peace march 
the `` die-ins '' or film like `` amazing grace and chuck '' 
`` miracle mile '' 
or `` testament '' .
