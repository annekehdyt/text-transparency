a really bad sequel .
part 1 had a lot of funny moment -
part 2 is just bad
( in a boring way )
and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans.shame on you 
otto waalkes ! the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider
who apparently seems to be pis*ed about the other character .
it is quite easy to identify with him ...
the screenplay is sloppy/non-existent .
the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately .
the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play .
technically the movie is awful as well ,
but who can blame the cinematographer/sound guy
who had to work with such an untalented director ?
