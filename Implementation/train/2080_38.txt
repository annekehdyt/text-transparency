i received this movie as a gift ,
i knew from the dvd cover ,
this movie are going to be bad.after
not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it .
what a pathetic movie .i almost did not finish watching this bad movie ,
but it will be unfair of me to write a review
without watching the complete movie.trust me
when i say
`` this movie sucks '' i am truly shocked
that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed
to make this pathetic movie ,
but it could not have cost more than $ 20 000
to produce this movie .
all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera .about 15 person with no acting skill 
a scrip
that were written by a couple of drunk person.in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter
( tara woodley )
run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town .
he are completely unharmed .
they went to a supposed to be abandon house ,
but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there .
just for the supposed to be drunk man
but all is not what it seems.then the supposed drunk man start
telling tara zombie story.the fist of his stupid lame story must be the worst in history.his storysgt .
ben draper let one of his soldier die of complete exhaustion
( i think
this is what happens )
after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups
he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ,
ben draperbury him in a shallow grave.but sgt .
ben draper are in for n big surprise .
his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt .
ben draper to take revenge on private wilson .
( next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered )
the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie
and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf.the twist ending were so lame.even
if you like b horror movie ,
do not watch this movie
