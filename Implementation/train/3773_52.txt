wow ... i can not believe
just how bad zombie doom
( aka violent sh ! t 3 )
really is .
i would heard the rumor ,
read the review -
but had to make my mind up for myself .
well 
let me tell ya -
it blows ! ! !
the worst acting of any film ever made 
dubbing
that must have been done
while everyone involved was completely wasted 
inept and laughable gore fx 
no discernible plot 
`` cinematography ''
that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder ,
weapon props
that are no joke -
made out of tin-foil -
the list goes on and on ...
three guy get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil sword .
two of the captive are freed along with a rebel of the island freak ,
and are given a day 's head start
before they are hunted down by the rest of the `` tribe '' ...
that is pretty much it ... honestly - this is one of the worst film i
have ever had the misfortune
to subject myself too .
the budget had to be about $ 200
and was spent entirely on the gore fx
( which actually may not have been a bad idea ... ) .
there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung-together ridiculous
looking gore scene with lot of horribly dubbed dialog .
this film makes other no-budget outing like premuto :
lord of the living dead look like titanic .
some may rank zd in the `` so-bad-it is-good '' category - and i guess
if you are really drunk or high
and watching it with a few friend mst3k-style -
i guess
it could be looked at that way .
but not by me .
i hated pretty much everything about it .
if zombie doom or zombie 90
( which is equally appalling
and is included as a `` bonus '' on the shock-o-rama release of zd )
is indicative of andreas schnaas ' other work -
then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death .
there is one amusing kung-fu battle in the latter half of the film ,
and a lot of blood -
so i will grant this one a very generous 3/10 -
do yourself a favor and skip this .
