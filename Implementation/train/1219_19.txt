i was excited to view a catalu\u00f1a\u00b4s film in the berlin\u00b4s competition .
but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious .
too much blood ,
too much time ,
too much theme for nothing .
the spanish civil war 
like every war 
was horrible .
the revenge 
a very human behavior 
not pretty at all 
is shown in uncountable film and play 
as well as the relation between homosexual and the scepticism in spain about catholicism .
but what mr villaronga try 
is a pseudo tragedy
that can belongs to the worst of the film\u00b4s history .
it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie .
i advise nobody under no circumstance
to go to see this film .
