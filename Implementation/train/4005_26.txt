`` pandora 's clock '' is a gripping suspense/thriller
that is a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film .
this movie ,
which aired in two part on nbc in its debut showing in 1996 ,
is about an airplane flight
that becomes infected with a virus
when one of the passenger just happens to be carrying this disease .
the u.s. government debate
on whether the plane should be destroyed or not ,
while the pilot
( richard dean anderson )
and a virus expert
( daphne zuniga )
try to figure something out
to avoid disaster .
i am not really a big fan of tv movie and miniseries ,
but i liked `` pandora 's clock '' .
it is one heck of a thrill ride .
