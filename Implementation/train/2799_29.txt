a fun concept 
but poorly executed .
except for the fairly good makeup effect 
there is really not much to it .
there are obvious problem ; for example ,
after taking what seems to be week and week to get from fat to normal size ,
the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in day ...
and once he is deathly thin
he stays pretty much equally deathly thin
for what seems to be a long time.in any case ,
the movie has far worse problem than that
-- the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-tv-show quality
and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around .
robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation
and is literally painful to watch ...
the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse.the only reason
why i am
giving this movie as high
as i am is that
once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and joe mantegna 's character takes over ,
the movie develops a fun 
campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse ' feel ,
and the gangster 's crazy scheme for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsy are somewhat fun to watch .
the ending 
if predictable 
is also nicely mean .
avoid
unless you are a king-o-phile
or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpson terrorizing a gypsy camp .
