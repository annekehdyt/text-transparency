from the first scene you are given clue
as to what may be going on here .
it becomes more and more obvious as the story roll on .
the acting is excellent throughout
and these actor touch your soul .
even though i knew
what was going to happen i
was extremely puzzled by the motive .
i am still puzzled as to why ben did what he did .
we could see in his face `` second thought '' ,
but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feeling .
it was a very interesting and touching story
but it left me confused .
maybe that was the point of the film .
i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice .
this guy knows how to entertain an audience !
