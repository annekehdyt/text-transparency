i still can not believe
that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap.this movie is worse than `` deadly friend '' .the plot is stupid ,
the acting is mediocre
and the film is deadly dull.i do not know
why wes craven hates his debut `` last house on the left '' -an absolute masterpiece of the genre and like
( probably )
this turkey.do not get me wrong ,
i really like some of his movie ,
but it was a real torture sitting and watching this .
