this film is one of tom cruise 's finest film .
he captures the audience imagination with his role of david aame .
his character can relate to us all in some way.the story line is very clever
and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film .
i never really watched cruise movie
that much
before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent .
my favourite part in the movie is the end
where it all comes to a big conclusion
and he find out the truth .
if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try .
it is one of those film
that once you have started watching
it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking
and you will regret it .
my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did
and it became one of my favourite film of all time .
it is a* 10/10 i promise once you watch it ,
it will stick with you
and you will like it forever .
