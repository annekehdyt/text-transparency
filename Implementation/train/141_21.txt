there is so much
that is wrong with this film ,
but to sum it up :
terrible acting- so bad
it must have been on purpose .
poor script -
they may have had some good idea
but this was not the best way
to present the story .
ridiculously bad ending- in some case the ending manage to save the film-not in this case .
if you manage to sit through the entire film you
will want to kick yourself at the end
because the ending is not even worth waiting for .
this is the worst film
i have seen in a long time .
it was complete torture
sitting through this film ,
i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance .
so do yourself a favor .
watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do .
even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture .
