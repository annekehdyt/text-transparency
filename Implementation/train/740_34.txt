oh yes 
sakura killer is a goofy 
horrible ninja movie 
make no mistake .
but it is also an incredibly enjoyable one .
this is largely thank to the awesome presence of one chuck connor ,
who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scene .
i suppose he is supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type
( `` the tough ninja-buster '' 
the box copy exclaim )
but his 'wisdom ' is laughable .
`` move without thinking '' ? ? ?
my friend says
this is the sign of mental retardation 
not of supreme concentration.but really 
his two aide 
sonny and dennis 
have such horrible dialogue
that 'brooklyn ' ,
as we call the colonel ,
tends to shine in comparison .
especially watch for dennis ' logic
regarding the 'genetic splicing '
the sakura are involved with .
if you know anything about cloning
you will die laughing .
and yes 
this is a major plot point ,
folks.a terribly fun movie ,
sakura killer is a hard-to-find gem .
i will not spoil the 'trick ' ending for you either ,
except that it is a perfect set up for a sakura killer 2. too bad chuck connor died .
: -
( because he does have a the smoothest way of blowing away ninjas .
