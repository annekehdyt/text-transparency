the sea is watching has been made from an original akira kurosawa script ,
and it is indeed a lush and warm film .
watching it will be a pleasure ! kei kumai
as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master
( particularly the mass scene in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting ) ,
but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable .
another thing that is missed here :
kurosawa always managed to let the character be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing.probably
that was his magic on set
while shooting ;
and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet.maybe
we just miss the eye of the master.this is one lovely and sweet film ,
but it is no kurosawa .
to expect
that might well be very silly ...
