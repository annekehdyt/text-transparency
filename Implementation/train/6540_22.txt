ok 
a slasher movie .
a very 
very stupid slasher movie.we got your stereotypical teenager in a house thing going .
we got a fbi agent
that is seen dirty harry one time too many .
`` so what is the secret ... .punk ? ''
we got about 4 different little camera shot and scene
that make no sense at all .
`` hey man 
i am fixing the sprinkler ''
(
( that guy was my favorite part of the movie ) )
suddenly
there is a preacher
tied up on a couch watching home movie ,
he gets killed.they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere 
with no cop .
suddenly she is in a church ,
wearing a wedding dress .
i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie
i have ever seen .
