imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater
only because you are in washington for the weekend
and it is raining
and you are finished with the museum .
you think
you might go see the sarah marshall movie
as the trailer look so so
and you do not have to engage your ain .
it is sold out .
option ?
- the bank job 
in bruge 
the leatherhead or prom night .
you have seen the bank job
( suprisingly decent heist movie that )
and in bruge ( again 
pretty good )
so you are down to two .
you do not fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniform ,
so you go see prom night right ?
wrong .
you take the $ 8.50 ,
walk up to a stranger in the street
and ask him to punch you in the face for $ 8.50 .
it would be money better
spent.it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever
it is supposed to be .
if i was financing that movie
and they showed me
that as a final cut i would not know whether to laugh or cry .
probably both .
an insult to anyone 's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie 
as for the acting ,
they might
as well have cast robot
( or maybe dog )
in the role 
they would have been more realistic .
the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen
( ben affleck and hayden christansan
( i hate his acting so much i do not care how you spell his name )
you are relieved on your title
( s ) )
so in summary 'not good '
