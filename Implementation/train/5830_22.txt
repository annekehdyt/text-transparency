i read somewhere
that
when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay ,
warner bros. retaliated
by casting her in inferior project for the remainder of her contract.she decided
to take the money .
but her career suffered accordingly.that might explain
what she was doing in `` comet over broadway . ''
( though it does not explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it 
too . )
`` ludicrous '' is the word
that other have used for the plot of this film ,
and that is right on target .
the murder trial .
her seedy vaudeville career .
her success in london .
her final scene with her daughter .
no part logically leads to the next part.also ,
the set and costume looked like b-movie stuff .
and her hair !
turner is showing lot and lot of her movie this month .
watch any other one and you will be doing yourself a favor .
