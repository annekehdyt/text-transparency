the sect
that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim
to take the 'message ' of the bible
without any alteration or extra-biblical influence .
the existence of this film is solely due to the fact
that there is no such thing.if
you want to know
what the born-again anch of christianity were harping on about in the seventy
just look up the word 'rapture ' in a dictionary of cult and sect .
it is quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid.poor acting 
uneven sound quality and a script
that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick
( paranoid christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the evangelical scene ) .
you could not really put this into the 'so bad
it is good ' category
so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection
looking to anch out or the extremely paranoid .
