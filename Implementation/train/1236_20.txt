i went into this film
thinking
it would be a crappy b-rated movie .
i came out surprised and very amused .
eva was good ,
but lake bell stole the show .
she had amazing comedic timing .
the joke in this film were surprisingly original
and really funny with one or two flat joke in between .
the plot was enough to tie it all together 
a woman
( eva )
dies on her wedding day
and comes back to haunt the woman
that is going out with her was-to-be husband 
its sounds far-fetched
but it actually works quite well .
7/10 - overall its a worthwhile cinema watch ,
if not get it on dvd
when it comes out .
