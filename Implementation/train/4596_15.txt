i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it .
her dancing was very entertaining .
i read somewhere
that she got the part in this movie
because she knew how to dance .
the scenery was great too .
yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful .
we laughed at the silly kissing scene ,
but that is what is great about old movie !
i grew up with her on the munster and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movie .
they may not all be the best out there
but still worth watching to see her act and sing .
i am slowly purchasing all her movie
and watching them as i receive them .
i have a large collection of her memorabilium .
