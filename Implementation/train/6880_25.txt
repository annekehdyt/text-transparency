what reviewer and mst3k left out is the best part
( and only memorable scene )
of this otherwise dreadful movie :
there is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene
committed by the bad guy
( ben gazzara look-alike )
on maria
( as mentioned ,
killed later through t.j. 's ineptitude ) .
perhaps rape is too strong a word ,
`` prison mating ritual '' may be more appropriate .
the background behind this chance ,
yet forced meeting is the mobster
who is hiding `` ben gazzara 
''
introduces him to the girl hanging out at his pool .
the 30-ish blonde disses him ,
but our villain must be quite smitten by her ,
because the courtship is on at that point .
his first move is to attempt drowning her ,
until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off .
kind of like the girl in high school you did not like ,
but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway ...
let 's just say ,
he catches up with her in the cabana later .
