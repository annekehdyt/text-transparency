except person apparently buy into this garbage !
as show like `` moral orel '' have shown ,
even if you tried to make the most outrageous ,
over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of ,
it would not come close to the hilarity of this show .
it is hard to tell what is even going on
when you are watching it .
is it a news show ?
a talk show ?
who knows ! ?
they start out by reporting on various international news story ,
but at seemingly random point 
the news is interrupted by this odd 
troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face 
mumbling and laughing
and generally being creepy.pat robertson does not even seem like such a bad guy at first glance .
he just seems like a senile ,
yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic belief
( like most of our grandparent ) .
but this is a man
who has called for an assassination ,
who has befriended and offered aid to not one ,
but two murderous dictator ,
who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mine ,
who has supported forced abortion in china ,
and who regularly implies that caucasian
( straight american male caucasian in particular )
are superior to all other races.still ,
this would all be funny ,
except that he apparently has a large enough fan base
to keep his little show on the air 40 year later
( either that 
or enough money to ibe some tv executive
who do not give a damn what they show ) .
the idiocy of the show becomes alarming
when you realize
that some person 
somewhere 
must be watching it
and hanging onto every word .
even when robertson has repeatedly shown
how corrupt he is ,
person still listen to him .
i do not know
if it is funny or scary .
i guess a healthy mixture of both .
