there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof :
it reminds you
just how bad bad can be .
we often see film
which we describe as `` pretty awful '' or `` not much good '' ,
but then you come across a film like this
and you can see
that
although all those other film are not `` good ''
they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof .
this was a birthday gift from someone
who spent less than two second rummaging thru ' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore
to fulfil an obligation
( i.e .
to give me a present ) .
it could have been a serendipitous find
but it was not :
this is so utterly clich\u00e9d ,
so badly written ,
so poorly directed ,
so badly acted
that i am surprised
everyone involved has not been arrested and sent down for 10 year .
god 
it is awful .
i suspected as much from about 30 second in ,
but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad film are so bad
they can be enjoyable .
this is not one of them .
it is simply bad .
i stopped
watching after 45 minute ,
and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin .
