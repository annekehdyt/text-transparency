the novel is easily superior
and the best part of the film are direct translation from what greene wrote ;
for instance the quiet but grim humour
that eaks into the scene with boyer and lorre 
or the murdered-child obsession
that takes over some of the plot .
where the film deviates from the novel ,
it tends to the ludicrous.however i do not want to suggest
that the film is bad in any way .
it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un .
some of the minor character were stock actor
who could turn their hand to anything.it
is a dreadful shame
that the film 's not available on dvd .
