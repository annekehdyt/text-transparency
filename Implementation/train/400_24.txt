wow 
this movie was so horrible .
i am so glad i did not have to pay money to see this horrible movie .
it was like a history nut
went on a coke binge !
the previews of it made it look decent
but it was really bad .
i will say
the idea sounded decent but come on .
it was really really bad .
if u sat down
and thought about it you would also realize
it was unrealistic .
come on back in the day u think
they had all
that stuff to work with .
it was not like ben franklin sat down one day
and made a damn riddle .
it was completely ridiculous ,
and it you want to see a bad movie
then by all mean go see this one .
all and all horrible movie
it might actually be on my top 10 worst film i
have ever seen .
