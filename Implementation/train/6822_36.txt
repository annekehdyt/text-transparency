apparently none of the previous reviewer ,
most of whom praise the film for its accuracy ,
have actually read a biography of louis pasteur.the most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between pasteur and napoleon iii.back in the 1930 's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light.while far from an admirable character-he
was an inept politician and a self-appointed `` military genius ''
who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous war ,
he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here .
he had an intelligent interest in science ,
and like many other person in the 19th century saw a ight future
because of the improvement it would ing.far from exiling pasteur ,
he was his patron ,
building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resource that he needed for his research.while the lab was under construction 
pasteur became gravely ill.a bureaucrat 
deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead 
ordered work halted on his own authority.when the emperor heard about this 
his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck-passing 
and work promptly resumed.the emperor personally visited pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab.the emperor would often ing member of his court to admire pasteur 's project 
and it was obvious to everyone that pasteur was one of the emperor 's favorites.pasteur 's main worry concerning the emperor was that napoleon thought pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything 
and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience.pasteur 
a very modest man 
was always protesting this 
but napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him 
and pasteur despite his misgiving 
always came through.they always had a close and friendly relationship 
and after the emperor was overthrown 
pasteur refused to say a bad word about him 
grateful to the end of his life.the part about his daughter
having the baby 
and pasteur sacrificing his principle
to get a doctor ,
never happened.the part about the anthrax and rabies ,
for which he was famous ,
is generally correct ,
but the notion
that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame
is false.he was famous and respected at the time this happened.this movie is ok from a dramatic standpoint 
but very distorted as biography .
