what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner
who decided to search for transcendental enlightenmant
by trying to join a country club ?
if he had ,
he could have called it the razor 's edge ,
since the katha-upanishad tells us ,
`` the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over ;
thus the wise say
the path to salvation is hard . ''
but maugham decided to stick with the well-ed class ,
and so we have darryl f. zanuck 's version of larry darrell ,
recently returned from wwi 
carefully groomed 
well connected in society
and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner .
or ,
as maugham tells us ,
`` this is the young man
of whom i write .
he is not famous .
it may be that
when at last his life comes to an end
he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone
thrown into a river
leaves on the surface of the water .
yet it may be that the way of life
he has chosen for himself
may have an ever growing influence over his fellow man ,
so that 
long after his death 
perhaps 
it will be realized
that lived in this age a very remarkable creature . ''
the razor 's edge has all of zanuck 's cultural taste
that money could buy .
it is so earnest ,
so sincere ... so self-important .
as larry goes about his search for wisdom ,
working in mine 
on merchant ship 
climbing a himalayan mountain
to learn from an ancient wise man ,
we have his selfish girl friend 
isabel ,
played by gene tierney ,
his tragic childhood chum
played by anne baxter 
the girlfriend 's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle
played by clifton webb ,
and willie maugham himself ,
played by herbert marshall ,
taking note .
the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness
that the only thing
that perks it up a bit
is clifton webb as elliot templeton .
`` if i live to be a hundred i shall
never understand
how any young man can come to paris without evening clothe . ''
webb has some good line ,
but we wind up appreciating clifton webb 
not elliot templeton .
zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century
when he bought the right to maugham 's novel .
he waited a year
until tyrone power was released from military service .
he made sure
there were well-dressed extra by the dozen 
a score
that sounds
as if it were meant for a cathedral
and he even wrote some of the scene himself .
the effort is as self-conscious as a fat man
wearing a rented tux .
despite hollywood 's view of thing in the razor 's edge ,
i can tell you that for most person hard work does not ing enlightenmant 
just weariness and low pay .
after nearly two-and-a-half hour 
we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale .
he is going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face .
`` my dear 
'' somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor ,
`` larry has found
what we all want and what very few of us ever get .
i do not think
anyone can fail to be better 
and nobler 
kinder for knowing him .
you see 
my dear 
goodness is after all the greatest force in the world ...
and he is got it ! ''
larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine .
maugham ,
lest we forget ,
was a fine writer of play 
novel 
essay and short story .
to see how the movie could do him justice ,
watch the way
some of his short story were ought to the screen in encore 
trio and quartet .
and instead of wasting time with larry darrell 
spend some time with lawrence durrell .
the alexandria quartet is a good read .
