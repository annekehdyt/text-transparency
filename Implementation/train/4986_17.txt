this is one of the worst horror movie i
have ever seen ... unfortunately ,
i am a horror movie buff
and will rent any horror movie
unless it is not made for t.v .
when looking at the box it says
it is rated r for gore and some language ...
where was the gore ?
was their one good death scene
where you actually saw gore ?
i could have overlooked
that
if there had been some ief nudity or some good dialogue .
there was not even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie .
sometimes horror movie are awesome
because they are so stupid ,
but this was just sad .
