somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show ,
but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-tv phenomenon .
there are dozen of famously bad movie
( e.g .
`` mano :
the hand of fate '' )
that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary 
witless waste of film.seriously 
why not a documentary about the jerry springer show ,
that would begin to answer some of the real question like :
who are these person ?
what happens to their life after they appear on this show ?
how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself here ? one good line :
during an `` orientation '' session for guest :
`` person 
i can not emphasize this enough :
no weapon ! ''
