i watched the un-aired episode online and i was so sad
that the show will not be back .
it had the best cast of mature 
talented actor and an amazing chemistry .
it seemed like all the actor are personal friend in real life .
towards the end the show became engaging 
sexy and highly watchable .
of course 
some of the story line are not realistic ,
so what ...
the character are all likable
and you root for them .
the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorite :
`` sex and the city '' and `` felicity '' .
big kudo to all the cast .
note to abc execs :
nielsen rating report do not show you true result .
the show audience will mostly record it .
i have been very disappointed with major network for flooding us with reality-tv or teenage oriented show .
why to get a mature 
thoughtful ,
well-acted material
we have to switch to hbo or fx ?
i can only thank the network
for putting the rest of the episode online .
the new stream medium will gain more and more popularity among viewer .
