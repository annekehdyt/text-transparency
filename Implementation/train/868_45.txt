robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raine 
franchot tone 
and alan curtis .
and he does it ,
i might add ,
without a lot of help from his male actor 
i.e. 
curtis and tone .
it is raine all the way 
a pretty 
leggy actress who for one reason
or another never reached the status of some of her `` noir '' counterparts.siodmak 's use of sex 
light 
shadow ,
and music is truly remarkable
as he tackles this genre .
the shadow 
lighting effect 
and camera angle are all effective .
but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook 
egged on by an excited raine .
it is this scene
that ings `` phantom lady '' into new territory.siodmak 's commitment to the material is matched only by raine ,
who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love
trying to save her man .
franchot tone phoned this one in .
alan curtis did not seem upset
that he might die
and did not seem happy that he lived .
and he never ,
except for a ief moment in prison 
seemed to be in love with raine.the amusing thing about many of these film is that 
as world war ii progressed 
interest in psychiatry deepened .
but often the term were used incorrectly in film such as `` possessed 
'' `` spellbound 
'' and `` the greatest show on earth . ''
tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez - tone
probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder ,
but he appears to be closer to a psychopath .
in actuality ,
as evidenced by his headach 
he may have had a ain tumor
pushing against his ain.phantom lady does not have the greatest plot ,
but it is well worth watching .
