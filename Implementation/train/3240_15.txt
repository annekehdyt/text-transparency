walter matthau and george burn just work so well together .
the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture
made in heaven .
the scene
when they meet again in willy 's flat
is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection .
walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian
as only he can ,
the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatic coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization .
george burn timing is legendary
and nowhere was it better than in this film ,
his calm aplomb with desert dry reply are memorable .
watch for the scene near the end
when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker ,
and al 's reaction - priceless .
