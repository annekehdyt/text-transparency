the three main character are very well portrayed ,
especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos .
he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser/invader .
the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business 
the contrast and similarity between the lower and higher class .
how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition .
9-9,5/10 .
