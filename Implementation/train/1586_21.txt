when i saw this at a shop i
thought
it looked really good and original .
like wolfs creek meet texas chainsaw massacre ,
and i mean it only cost three quid
( around $ 6 ) .
to be honest i do not think
it was even worth that.it
seemed like the directors- the 'butcher other ' could not decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror .
it ended up with a clich\u00e9 ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minute with all the character
being one dimensional
and you could not care less what happened to them
but to try to make the audience care about the character
they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film
which to be perfectly honest
was not needed.the only good part really was the middle/end- i will not ruin it for you .
but that was the only `` good `` part.overall a pointless watch .
it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minute .
if you want an artsy film-do not bother .
if you want a slasher movie- do not bother- the film move
so slowly with nothing ever happening .
