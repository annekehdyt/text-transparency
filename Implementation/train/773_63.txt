there are some good thing about the movie .
the music and cinematography is great .
alex wilson is hot
and gives a great performance .
ryan bauer is also hot .
the production was very lucky to have casted them
because they really give production value to the movie .
jonny vincent
( sean )
and a lot of the boy in the movie
that do not speak
are cute too .
why is not the actress
who plays amy listed in the credit ?
brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance
as clitarissa pink.the worse
thing about the movie is probably the star 
jame townsend .
he can not act .
he is also very scrawny 
not nice to look at at all .
his arm are like spaghettus .
it is disgusting .
they have no muscle tone at all .
it is no wonder
he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it .
no one else would cast him in anything.jame townsend is not believable as someone
who would even have a girlfriend
because he acts so gay .
they should have casted someone else as the lead if
they wanted what is best for the movie .
then again 
maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle
to launch a career in soft-core porn ,
definitely not real acting
because he would have taken some acting lesson .
plus 
anyone
who does porn
is blacklisted in hollywood.the most ridiculous thing about the movie
is probably the casting of a tan-skinned latina as devon 's mother .
sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all .
all in all 
this movie is soft-core porn
and is no better than something
you would see on skinemax .
i think
even alex wilson 
probably the best thing about this movie 
is embarrassed by it
and does not want to be associated with it .
there is no photo on his imdb page
and nothing else listed ,
so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name .
plus 
i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently
and when i mentioned this movie ,
he just turned around
and walked away .
i understand .
if i had worked on this movie ,
i would be embarrassed
and would not want to be associated with it either .
