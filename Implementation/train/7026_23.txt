there were some scary scene ,
which i have alway liked more than straight out gore ,
but otherwise this movie was rather weak .
there were too many question left unanswered ,
and
when they tried to explain anything in the movie ,
it was still rather unclear .
after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of way .
it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few year back .
that movie was also unsatisfying ,
but still better than this
because it did try to work
and the story did actually make sense .
this one 
not so much.the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent ,
but the movie dragged on an on ,
and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion .
like i said above ,
there were some creepy scene ,
but otherwise 
this movie was a mess .
sorry 
i can not recommend it .
