i had mixed feeling for `` les valseuse ''
( 1974 )
written and directed by bertrand blier
when i started watching it
but i ended up liking it .
i would not call it vulgar
( `` dumb and dumber '' is vulgar ,
`` the sweetest thing '' is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid ) ;
i would call it shocking and offensive .
i can understand
why many viewer 
especially 
the female would not like or even hate it .
it is the epitome of misogyny
( or so it seems ) ,
and the way two antihero treat every woman
they had meet seems unspeakable .
but the more i think of it the more i realize
that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem .
i am fascinated
how blier was able to get away with it .
the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable :
it is well written ,
the acting by all is first - class ,
and the music is sweet and melancholic .
actually ,
when i think of it ,
two buddy had done something good to the woman
they came across
to :
they prepared a woman in the train
( the lovely 
docile blonde brigitte fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debut in ren\u00e9 cl\u00e9ment 's `` forbidden game ''
( 1952 )
at age 6 ) for the meeting with her husband
whom she had not seen for two month ;
they found a man
who was finally able to get a frigid marie-ange
( miou-miou )
exited and satisfied ;
they enlightened and educated young and very willing isabelle huppert
( in one of her early screen appearance . )
their encounter with jeanne moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level .
in short 
i am not sure i would like to meet g\u00e9rard depardieu 's jean-claude and patrick dewaere 's pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner
but i had a good time
watching the movie
and two hour almost flew -
it was never boring .
