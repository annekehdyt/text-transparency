this films makes no pretentious effort
to hide its true genre
-- a campy b movie .
it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy .
it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese .
but the two come together in this film in way
that make you go ,
`` hmmmmm ... that is so stupid ! ''
and then have you laughing .
for example 
there is a scene back in `` 16th century japan '' ,
which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple .
in the background of the temple 
there are several tourist looking off in the distance in slipper and short .
hmmmm ... hahahah !
i could not stop laughing .
and the acting goes from decent 
to bearable 
to oh my lord ,
but that is what makes it funny .
you will see some decent actor
and then find other really terrible .
i have to digress somewhat though
because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several play
and she is awesome .
her air time in the film was pretty short though .
i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several play in the island during my visit
and he is also better in theatre than in this movie .
anyhow 
it is an entertaining film ,
if you have got nothing to do on a weekday evening .
