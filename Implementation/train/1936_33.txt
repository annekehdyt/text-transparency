when i was flicking through the tv guide ,
and came across `` twisted desire '' on the movie section ,
i read
it is description .
three word caught my eye `` melissa joan hart '' ... i find her role in `` saina :
the teenage witch '' absolutely vile ,
i hate those kind of program ,
so i was just thinking
that it was going to be a boring old ,
love story
starring her ... little did i know.it finally started on the television ,
i had my bucket ready in case i were to puke over it is cheesiness or soppiness ,
you know what i mean .
at first 
you think
she is just a nice 
ordinary girl
who 's in love ,
but has mean parent .
then
when you find out
she is manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parent ,
so she could be with her true love ,
you are like `` whoa '' .
you just do not expect this sort of role for that sort of actress .
she played her role very well in my opinion ,
i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch 
and voil\u00e0 ,
she did it perfectly !
congrat to her ,
the movie was very good ,
i would definitely watch it again
and recommend it to other .
