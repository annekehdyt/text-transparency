i considered myself to be quite melancholy ,
especially when i watch a great touching and tear-jerking movie .
but not for this one
(
which surprised me ! )
and it is also really surprising me to see how many person praised this movie
so highly.there are several disturbing
fact throughout the movie :
1. despite guilt-ridden ben 's real intention
to save 7 life
to redeem his past ,
i find it disturbing
that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action .
some person may perceive this is a heroic action and some other think
he behaves cowardly 
in the end this was a disturbing action to me.2 .
the movie story line is over-dramatized ,
but the logic is over-simplified .
medically 
blood type match is required to be an organ donor .
toward the end of the film we learnt
that emily had rear blood type
that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period .
nevertheless 
it seemed
that ben had the rare blood type 
same as her
which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently ,
despite the rarity of ben 's blood type ,
he was able to donate not only his heart 
but also his kidney 
his cornea and his bone marrow
which in all case require not only matching blood type
but also tissue antigen.3 .
why the doctor allow ben 's organ being donated
despite the jellyfish venom
he used
to kill himself ?
i might be over-analyzing the whole story
as after all this is just a movie .
however 
some disturbing fact outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan
to go to watch this movie .
if you go for a soap-opera type of film ,
go for it .
but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment ,
give this one a miss !
