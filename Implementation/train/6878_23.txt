simply great movie no doubt about it .
great story and superb performance 
be it amitabh 
akshay 
shefali 
priyanka 
boman or rajpal .
hindi film industry is going shameless with mallika and co ,
this movie is totally vulgarity free
and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our indian society .
but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb .
anu malik
( boring copy-cat )
could have been avoided
and ismail darbar or himmesh reshmmiya could have been used as musician .
i think
vipul shah should have given little bit gujarati touch particularly in music also .
anu malik is worst musician around
and he thinks
himself popstar
but this is not the movie
where is presence was required-he look only good with govinda style song .
i felt some nice serious music with couple of good ghazal or sad song could have made this movie more memorable .
