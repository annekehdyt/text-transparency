i participate in a filmmaker 's symposium ,
and this film was shown
after we had already seen a not so great film
and participated in a 40 minute discussion .
even though it was incredibly late
and we were weary ,
the entire audience really enjoyed it.personally i thought
the film was hilarious in all the right spot ,
and i loved the quirky cast of character .
they really grow on you in the film .
