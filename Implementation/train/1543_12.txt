this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depth of the darkest side of human behaviour .
loosely linking a half a dozen story of the worst kind of depravity 
perverted sex 
greed 
violence and intolerance .
all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky day during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film .
for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode ,
closely followed by the scene of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slag ' flat .
you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film .
i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through .
1/10 for 'fun ' 8/10 for displaying 'man '
as he sometimes is .
