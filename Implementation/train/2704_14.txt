one wonders how the script came to be written.wayne and the other performer do an ok job
but
as it is neither comedy 
romantic thriller or anything else
it is all rather disappointing.one feel
as if one of the thread had been pursued
it could have been something worthwhile .
it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made
just before the usa became directly involved with the war .
i wonder
if the surrounding politic had something to do with trying
to make a movie for all taste
but ending up with something
that pleases no one.nonetheless it has historical value .
