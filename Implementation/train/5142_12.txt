i also saw this amazingly bad piece of `` anime '' at the london sci-fi festival .
if you have to watch this thing ,
do so with a large audience preferably after a few beer ,
you may then glean some enjoyment from it .
i found the dialogue hilarious ,
lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator .
the animation is awful .
it is badly designed and badly executed .
it may have been a good idea for the producer
to have hired at least one person
who was not colour blind.there is nothing else to say really ,
this film is a failure on every level .
