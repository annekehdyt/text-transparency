tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thank to the aftereffect of the nearby nuclear plant 's accidental release of toxic waste.unrestrained chaos
crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior .
rather horrible 
obviously intended to be ,
mess of a film with the filmmaker cutting loose the rein
allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up .
craft was far down troma 's list of objective for this gory sleazefest .
the honor society are punk with eerie face paint job and wacky outfit .
the german teacher
who becomes a member ,
through a `` toxic kiss '' has the streak down one side of her face
that really gave me the creeps.the toxic monster ,
which dispatched the annoying punk towards the end ,
is pretty cool 
though.kind of movie trash connoisseur will emace wholeheartedly .
