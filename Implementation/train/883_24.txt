i could not 
for the life of me 
follow 
figure out or understand the story .
as the plot advances
it too stays incomprehensible .
i am going to guess
and say
that there was a preproduction story/plot problem
that never got sorted out .
the producer could never separate the many detail
that the novel 
or any novel 
has the time and space
to create from the other idea ,
which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer 's pursuit by the police .
they ended up with too many thing happening in a proscribed feature film time limit .
too bad really
because they had a solid cast 
a director
who knows how to move thing around and excellent cinematography .
in fact 
a well made movie
that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hour .
