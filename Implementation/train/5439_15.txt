you know
you are in trouble
when the opening narration basically tells you
who survives .
it all goes downhill from there .
unnecessary 
`` matrix '' -influenced bullet-time camera work .
pointless cut to video game footage .
crusty old sea captain and wacky seaman .
raver who become skilled combatant in the blink of an eye .
even the zombie are boring.i was hoping for at least a `` so bad it is good '' zombie movie ,
but this one is `` so bad those
involved with its creation
should be barred from ever
making a movie again '' .
