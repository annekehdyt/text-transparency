julia ross
( nina foch )
agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughe family
to get over her boyfriend leaving her .
almost immediately she is drugged
and shipped off to the family 's estate in cornwall .
when she awakens they keep telling her
she is marion hughe ,
has been mentally ill
and keep her locked up ... but why ?
you will probably guess
why but will not mind
because this one is fun.along with `` the narrow margin ''
and `` face behind the mask '' this is one of the best b picture ever made .
( b picture were low budget picture
made quickly with low budget and no major star ) .
it is just as long as it needs to be
( only 65 minute ) ,
is well-directed 
fast paced and exciting .
it only stumbles at the end
which i found a bit too implausible to buy.foch
( a good actress )
is just ok in the lead
but dame may witty is great
and george macready is excellent
( and frightening )
as the villain .
well worth catching .
a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget .
