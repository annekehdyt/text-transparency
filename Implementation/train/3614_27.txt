somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller
that has jamie foxx as a hapless 
fast-talking hoodlum
who is chosen by an overly demanding u.s. treasury agent
( david morse )
to be released on the street of new york
to find a picky computer thief/hacker
( doug hutchinson ) ,
who stole forty-two million dollar from the treasury
and left two guard shot dead .
`` bait '' marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua
( `` the replacement killer '' )
and he handles the task fairly well
even though it does not top his first movie .
what the two film have in common
is the action sequence ,
which are flat-out excellent.foxx is pretty good here
although his character is annoying in the beginning ,
but throughout the film 
i began to catch on .
hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind
who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient
as the late laurence olivier was in `` marathon man '' .
morse is okay as the agent
who comes up with the ingenious plan
to get whoever
did it at all cost .
