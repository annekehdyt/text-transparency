badly directed garbage .
a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ...
if you are the sort of person
who likes
that ... see a shrink .
even if you are that person
it does not make this a good film ,
the acting is really poor ,
the story full of plot hole ,
the director really should just give up and find a real job
as he has no talent for this one .
i can see why person dislike uwe boll ..
we have had a few of his film on lately
and this is the best of them ,
which is really sad !
a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some person
but here it just grates .
horror film can be full of desolation ,
they can be miniature work of art ,
they can be just good viewing
when there is nothing else on ... seed is just really really poor .
