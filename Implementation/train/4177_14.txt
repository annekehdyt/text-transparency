this movie is inspiring to anyone
who is or has been in a tough jam ,
whether financially or emotionally .
you will definitely laugh ,
which is the best medicine !
: )
left in a bad financial situation
when her husband dy ,
grace has to find a new way
to make some money
and it is not exactly legal
which adds to the humour .
even my boyfriend liked it so do not think
that it is a chick-flic .
