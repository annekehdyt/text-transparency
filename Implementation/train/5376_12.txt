a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen
( god told me too 
q 
etc .
) 
full moon high try so hard to be funny and fails miserably 
even with decent turn by ed mcmahon
( ! )
and kenneth mar .
alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance
and son adam simply looks numb .
this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic .
