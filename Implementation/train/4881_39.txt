one the whole ,
this movie is not perfect .
it does not 'hang well ' together
as the story line is basically a bunch of hook
to hang joke.some of these joke are a little 'too 80s '
and tend to date the picture.but some of these joke are classic.you know
a movie has something special
when you and your friend still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decade later.plus 
there are a bunch of familiar faces ; michael keaton 
danny devito 
joe piscapo 
peter boyle 
marilu henner 
maureen stapleton 
bob eubank 
griffin dunne 
and one of the last role of alan hale jr. 
the skipper from gilligan 's island.also 
there are some great absurdist moment ,
like when johnny is labelling the puppy with a pricing gun ,
or the pope making an appearance in johnny 's neighborhood .
also 
the scene
where the fake priest makes up a lot of word in latin
is excellent .
( `` summa cum laude 
magna cum laude 
the radio 's too louda ... post meridian 
ante meridian 
uncle meridian '' )
.other classic scene include ramone maroney butchering the english language
danny devito
urging griffin dunne to 'play ball ' peter boyle
thinking
he lost his manhood
the fake vd moviethis movie is no home run .
but like 'porky 's ' 
it has enough classic comedy bit
to make it memorable .
