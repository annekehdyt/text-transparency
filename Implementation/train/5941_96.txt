when i was 11 ,
grease 2 was like crack .
it was a classless 
shameful 
euphoric 
and powerfully addictive experience .
my sister and i would watch it 
rewind it ,
and watch it over again and again
and again
until we passed out or became too confused and hostile
to stand one another .
so 
if you are an 11-year old girl ,
and you reviewed this film as `` illiant '' or `` fun '' or `` better than the original grease 
''
you have your fledgling adolescent hormone to blame
and you can rest assured
that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.if 
however 
you are not a little girl ,
you have absolutely no excuse
to suggest
that grease 2 was anything but an inane 
artless 
slipshod embarrassment for all
who participated in its production 
distribution 
and/or consumption.for the sake of criticism ,
i will dignify the film now
by explaining
why it blows 1. in a well-executed musical ,
the song should advance the narrative or develop the character .
in grease 2 
with a few debatable exception 
to the music is obscenely pointless .
most of the song appear to relate gimped
innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way
( `` score tonight 
'' `` reproduction 
'' `` do it for our country 
''
and `` prowlin ' '' )
without making one concrete statement about any of the film 's character or theme .
plus 
all of the music is uncomfortably stupid
and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability
to sing or dance.2 .
the t-bird should be badass ,
and if not at least somewhat likable ,
but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser .
in the end ,
when johnny nogerelli offer michael the sacred t-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang ,
michael should kick it to the ground 
spit on it 
and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body
that was touched by it .
but of course 
he accepts it
as if it is gold
because despite the fact
that they are a bunch of bumbling meathead ,
there is no greater honor than to be one with the t-bird .
3. since michael is beautiful 
smart 
kind 
resourceful 
and above average in everyway
( his musical impotence notwithstanding ) ,
it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately emace him
when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask .
stephanie 
on the other hand 
is a slovenly 
slack-jawed 
bubble gum smacking 
dirty sweatshirt wearing 
gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat .
so aside from being pretty
( i guess ) ,
she harbors no likable characteristic 
thus ,
audience are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael 's attraction to her.i could go on and on ,
but i did not want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor
since there are apparently so many crank out there
who seem to feel
that such a comparison is unfair .
i will say this though 
to those of you
who think
you want to revisit this mess for old time 's sake :
grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss .
only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby ace .
the magic is gone
and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed .
trust me .
