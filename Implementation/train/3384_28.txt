do not let the name of this film deceive you ,
in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero
ever known to film .
when jake speed is not saving virgin girl from evil madman ,
which he is often not ,
he is seriously relaxing .
perhaps this adds to his charm ,
but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to `` chill out ''
whenever he gets the chance .
furthermore 
unlike other daring hero
who usually have an impressive list of talent ,
this man has none ,
unless of course you call sleeping a talent .
anyhow 
this movie is basically worthless ,
the writing is sub par and the action ,
when there is some ,
is very lame .
( the machine guns on the jeep were not bad ,
but that is about it ) so ,
if you are in the mood
to watch a movie
that is a cure for insomnia ,
then this piece is perfect for you -
it has a hero
that not only puts himself to sleep ,
but also his audience .
