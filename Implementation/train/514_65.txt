we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie .
basically 
dinosaur come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart
named neweye
( which i needed
after i watched this movie ) .
apparently 
neweye hears the wish of child everywhere
and decides
that he should grant the wish of child
that dinosaur be ought into modern time
to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation .
the dinosaur eat this stuff
that makes them smarter
( too bad the screenwriter did not have it ) .
by the way 
does it seem weird
that out of all the wish of the child in the world 
neweye grant the wish of inging dinosaur to modern time ?
why not grant the wish of kid
to stop famine ?
disease ?
war ?
i mean come on !
does not neweye have anything better to do with all this power
he has ? ? ?
finally ,
when the dinosaur get to modern time
they start singing 
dancing and wrecking havoc
( basically the kind of thing
you might see on a bad lsd trip ,
i mean where else could you see a t-rex playing golf
and jumping on a balloon of spider-man ? ) .
they end up in the circus and neweye brother screweye
( ? ? ? )
makes the kid
that have befriended the dinosaur sign a blank contract .
why ?
why would kid sign a blank contract ? ? ?
screweye says
that
if the dinosaur take some ... '' brain-drain ''
that he will let the child go .
the dinosaur instead of tearing apart the evil screweye limb from limb ,
give in and agree to his term .
what ? !
this is stupid !
they could have just menaced him ,
made him drop the contract ,
eaten it then walked off with the kid .
i think
the filmmaker were trying to show
that violence is bad ,
which is a moot point
when finally the dinosaur escape and a bunch of crow envelop screweye and apparently completely eat him .
oh yeah 
that is not violent at all !
we are back makes no sense ,
it is not fun ,
it is goofy ,
it is stupid ,
poorly written
and contains some of the biggest plot hole ever committed to film .
even for a kid 's film ... this is bad .
