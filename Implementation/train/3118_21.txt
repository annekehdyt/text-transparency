24 has got to be the best spy/adventure series tv had ever aired .
the whole idea
of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period
is dazzling .
the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it .
and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonist in a tv series in a long time .
i rate this 
along with the simpson and the x-file 
my three most favorite tv series.this first episode begin with the conspiracy
to assassinate us senator david palmer
who is also running for president .
bauer is called to his office in order to discover
who is behind all this and 
at the same time 
figure his daughter 's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom .
thus 
begin an adventure on the best political style and ,
what is best of it ,
is that it always takes place in real time ,
which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time
where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same thing over and over and over .
