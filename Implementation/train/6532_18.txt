the title should have been `` the walker '' .
that was only
he did walk.there was nothing on the movie
that was good .
the description of the movie does not really comply with the plot.the only thing
that i can get from the movie
is
that he was a good son ,
but a low life terrible person.i am sorry
that i expend my money and time 
on this movie .
i saw person leaving the theater in the middle of the movie .
i stayed hoping
that it will better ... .what a mistake .
i got worse.if
there is a suggestion
that i can make to he producer is to re-direct his life to another field ,
because making movie is definitely no his cup of tea
