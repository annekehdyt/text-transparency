when plague eaks out in new orlean ,
it is richard widmark to the rescue in `` panic in the street 
'' one of the lesser-celeated film of the great elia kazan .
kazan keeps the pace isk ,
and there are lot of marvelous touch
- the scene between widmark and barbara bel gedde ,
who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationship of average citizen ,
which is in sharp contrast to the life and relationship of the low-lifes ,
portrayed by a menacing jack palance 
his weak yes man 
zero mostel 
tommy cook 
and louis charle .
there are also some interesting visual - palance has a couple of scene with actor
who seem to come up to his knee in height.the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp
if the story is not quite up to the direction and performance .
it has a few questionable aspect
which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily .
that aside ,
it is well worth viewing .
kazan was a masterful director .
