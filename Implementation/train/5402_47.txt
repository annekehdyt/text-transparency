regarded by many critic as one of the biggest stinker of all time
( certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma 's career )
.sherman mccoy
( tom hank )
is a smug rich boy
whose life goes to piece
when he and his lover maria ruskin
( melanie griffith )
are involved in a hit-and-run .
his story is chronicled by another smug guy 
reporter peter fallow
( bruce willis )
.well ,
as i said
in my summary ...
what is this movie supposed to be ?
it seems to combine comedy 
drama 
and satire ,
but it sure does not add up to much .
it is undermined by unimaginably loathsome 
one-dimensional character
who you would never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.i
am no big fan of the novel
( i started reading it once ,
but could not finish it
because it was not to my liking )
but it is obvious to me
that those
who did /
do enjoy the novel consider this film
to be a complete travesty.i
have never seen so many talented actor strive to hard
to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail .
what a waste.the problem start with casting nice guy tom hank in a role
that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic .
and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit .
bruce willis is badly ,
badly miscast in the role .
what was the thinking there.alas ,
not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact ,
being obliged to deliver a lame 
heavy-handed lecture on 'decency ' after the climax.this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.i liked the assemblage of talent ;
for that i will give it four out of ten ,
but i am sure
some person will say
a much better movie could have been made from the source material .
