red eye 
a movie
that id had wanted to see for awhile ... cillian murphy plays jack ripner
( jack the ripper )
a managerial pose to assassin ,
and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family.an everyday woman `` lisa ''
( i think )
is a normal woman ,
goes to work 
home ... worry ...
hates to fly.the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight
which delayed several time.a flight
where she meets jack ...
an ordinary seeming guy ,
until he suavely reveals his profession and plan ,
which coincidentally include her in them ,
she is the key to the keefe 's
( sp ? )
death.she succeeds in saving them ...
but nearly the cost of her life is taken ,
jack is beaten ...
the keef are saved ...
oh what a story *laughs* just kidding 
the movie is really good actually 
the best of last year ... there are small thing
that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie
that play a great importance to the movie later ...
( the frankenstein pen )
i watched it several time before catching all the little joke and quirk ... a must see for thriller fan no sexual ,
but there is a slight hint
( the bathroom scene )
( jack )
`` thank for the quicky '' and the ( female attendant )
`` ohhh ... its gon na be one of those flight ''
( second female attendant )
`` hey !
this is not a motel ''
you get the idea ...
