there are very few movie
that are so funny as this one .
i was lucky enough
to watch this movie at a theater `` reserved '' for movie buff like me ,
so it was not so embarrassing
sitting
there laughing till my jaw was completely sore
and my shirt sleeve were all wet from drying my eye ...
at time the story was a bit `` slow '' ,
but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisle
( i nearly fell out of the seat ... )
was most welcome .
