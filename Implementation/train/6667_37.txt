having been forced by my child to watch this at least 10 time for each of the last 2 christmas ,
i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr. seuss ' classic tale ,
and well ... it is not very good .
first off ,
following a classic act like chuck jone ' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone ,
but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing .
i will concede
that there are a handful of inspired gag ,
but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab 
at the same time
as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas .
jim carrey is typically over the top here ,
but that is completely at odd with the character of the grinch .
as characterised by boris karloff ,
he was a slow burn ; methodical and sly .
there is no method to carrey 's madness ,
and that is only the most obvious error made .
talented actor like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here .
why 
universal 
why ?
i mean 
i understand
that tony hopkin will take just about any role offered
( much like his countryman michael caine ) ,
but this one needs to be filed under `` film
that should never have been made . ''
this does not bode well for the cat in the hat 
an even thinner tome
that universal is prepping for this christmas .
i get the feeling
that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one :
skip it ,
and either read the book or watch the tv special .
this is 2 hour
you can never ,
ever get back .
