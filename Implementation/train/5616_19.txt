okay 
'enjoy ' is a pretty relative term ,
but flexibility is in order
when you are dealing with a filmmaker of jame glickenhaus ' calie.mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous ,
over the top action film i have ever seen ,
without the nasty edge of the exterminator .
other review have commented on a suspension of disbelief
regarding the film 's heroic middle
aged commandos ,
but how about making a film in the philippine
that is set in colombia ?
all the extra are filipino .
in fact the only character
who looks remotely hispanic
is good ol ' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente ' !
oh yes 
we also have marium conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader .
there are ton of explosion
and body flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glory of american imperialism .
