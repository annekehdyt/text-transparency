this movie was a stupid piece of crap .
bad everything .
why is it that we who love western movie get jilted nine out of ten time when renting western .
it seems
that
if you do not see name like robert duval 
kevin kostner 
or tom selleck attached to the cover ,
it is not worth messing with .
for the most part the main action of shiloh fall was taking place in 1892 ,
yet the revolver used were 1860s model .
even the shooting was bad - in one scene
the marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine time
and could not hit any of three large man
who were only about twenty foot away .
i had to turn it off after about 15 minute of this inanity .
perhaps those
who participated in this movie
could have taken some lesson at the sunset carson school of acting .
