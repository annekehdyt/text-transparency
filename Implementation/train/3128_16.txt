to sat how awful the shield is ,
you would have to write page and page ,
so suffice it to say
that it is a monument to bad directing .
`` when director go awry '' should have been the title of this production .
indeed 
director are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling
that propels the story forward.how is constantly shaking the camera
and playing with the zoom lens a `` style '' ?
how is it propelling the story forward ?
of course there is also the `` editing by random number '' nonsense .
apparently it is become hip to just cut randomly.i guess
it is too much work
to do good editing.well ,
that made it too much work for most person to watch the shield
which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched show of all time .
