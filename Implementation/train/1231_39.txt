you can be fooled by your first impression .
as in 
initial reaction to a movie 
for example .
as in 
the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it
( first of all 
i love black comedy ) .
could even -
despite being male ,
myself - empathise with the feisty girl ' fervor to see their husband deceased
without delay .
was tripped up by my own face-value
( and 
i do mean `` face-value '' )
response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dame in the picture .
it just goes to show you
that you have got ta step back from a situation sometimes
and see
that it is bad
( and not `` bad good 
'' either ) :
the reason i am
giving this movie a `` 4 '' rating
is because of ms sheridan and her gam
( the rest of 'er is pretty good 
too ) ;
but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristic -
which means you will be disappointed
if your a lover of movie
made for the big screen .
the story contains plot hole
you could run a tunnel through - and i will generally overlook hole in a plot
if the overall thing does it for me ;
and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time
i saw it .
i do not think
it is a total waste of time 
but ... .
