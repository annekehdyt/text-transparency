`` secret of the len '' is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine .
the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki ,
who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime .
i wish
he did more campiness like this.my favorite scene are the psychedelic cg sequence ,
the part where lord helumis blows up his failing henchman 
the party riot
that bill causes
( one of the funniest scene )
and whenever my favorite character 
worsle appears.check this out.warning :
this is not for serious sophisticated anime fan !
