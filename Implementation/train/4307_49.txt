pathetic attempt to use science
to justify new age religion/philosophy .
the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said
about quantum physic in this mess is just plain wrong.example ?
quantum theory supports the idea in eastern religion
that reality is an illusion .
how ?
well 
in the world of the subatomic 
you can never definitely predict a particle location at a specific time .
you can only give the odd of it being precisely at one spot at one time .
also 
the act of observation seems to affect the event .
solid particle can pass through barrier .
all of this 
so far 
is accurate .
but then they assert that that means
that if you believed sincerely enough
that you could walk through a wall ,
you could indeed do it .
this is complete poppycock .
instead 
the theory asserts
that at our level ,
it is possible for you to walk through a wall ,
but it is merely by chance
and has nothing to do with belief .
also you would have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance
of passing through the wall ,
the odd are so astronomically against it.this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science .
but much more annoying is the narrative
involving an unhappy photographer ,
played by marlee maitlan .
about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused
as to be incomprehensible .
something to do with negative thought leading to addiction and self-hate .
there may be some truth to that ,
but quantum physic has nothing to do with it.plus ,
string theory is the hot new thing in physic nowaday .
instead of wasting your time with this dreck ,
i suggest
you rent the elegant universe 
an amazing series
done for nova on pbs
that gives you a history of physic from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episode .
quantum mechanic is explained there quite well
if you want to know it
without the fog of metaphysical appropriation .
