this was an excellent film .
i do not understand why so many person do not like it .
there was so much in it to connect with 
so many beautiful image ,
and so much compassion in the thing
that were not said .
i was thoroughly entertained ,
and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance ,
just as i am
when i finish most any tom robbins story .
now i have not read this particular book of robbin 's ,
so i do not now how this matched up ,
but i can not imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation .
the movie left a lot for you
to define yourself ,
which is the best part of any tom robbins novel ,
dreaming up the detail .
to all of you
who said
this was the worst movie ever ,
i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your heart .
far from the worst ever this movie was glorious .
long live the whooping crane .
