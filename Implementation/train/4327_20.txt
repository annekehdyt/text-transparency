this is a film
that was very well done .
i had heard mixed review
while it was in production
and have been waiting for its release !
cheer to the director and all the actor .
the supporting cast gave eva mendez
what she needed to take this to the top .
as everyone else here state ,
the latter portion of the film is riveting .
katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character ,
being she had not done a lot of work
when this film was made .
she has quite the career ahead of her .
i was amazed at her performance .
i completely enjoyed the film ,
questioned my value in life and priority ,
and am a better person for it !
a great message lies within the film .
release it so all can enjoy !
