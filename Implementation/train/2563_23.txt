i am appalled at how bad this film is .
as a pastiche of early 20th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past the modern or
( gasp )
cradle will rock
and i never thought
i would see a film worse than those 2. granted
they were about a slightly different milieu and period .
nevertheless the intent and result were distressingly similar.first off
there is the horrible casting :
eddie izzard as chaplin ?
excuse me ?
peter 
did you owe this guy something ?
jennifer tilly as loulla parson ? ?
kirsten dunst as marion davy ? ? ?
holy smoke 
these person do not even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period
they are purportedly depicting.well ,
last picture show was a decent film ,
but this thing is a disaster
and the rest of bogdonovitch 's pic have not been much better .
guess rubbing up against welle and hitch and ford wore off a long time ago .
still good for hosting tcm though .
