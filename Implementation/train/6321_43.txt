movie had some good acting and good moment
( though obviously pretty low budget ) ,
but bad rating due to basic premise
being badly developed .
the main point of conflict between the two lead does not play out in a realistic manner at all .
there are a few scene
where they disagree
because of it 
but no discussion of any great depth that would explain
how they can be together
while seeing the world so differently ,
especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life
( and adam is active enough with his
that he supports it with time and money . )
also 
several time glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way
he is ( apologizing to adam for his past )
while adam is shown to be upstanding and `` traditional 
''
which the film proclaims to be the `` good '' way in the end .
i do not like being preached to like that .
i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr ,
and he said
that he presented this conflict between them because ,
if he was in glenn 's shoe
( and he said
he does in real life relate to glenn 's view )
that he could never date someone with adam 's view .
well 
then 
i think
he should have done a much better job
explaining how glenn could do it in the film .
also 
director said
he directed this 
his first movie ,
only after reading
( directing for dummy . )
directing was not that bad 
but far from a top notch effort .
i have seen worse ,
but i rarely leave film feeling this frustrated .
