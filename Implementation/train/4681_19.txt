this film evil breed :
the legend of samhain contain very little thought or effort .
it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast `` slasher '' style death and plain disgusting act of death .
the acting was rated a d
as the actor show very little ability ,
and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable .
the way
they portrayed what person their age act like was incredibly different .
the odd split of porn is fit in thought
it really does not offer much ,
and any area
that is respectable
but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death .
example is the poor
fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus ,
and the scene lasts for about 5 minute .
it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kid put up .
this film is a good choice for someone
who likes to watch some awful death and practically torture .
