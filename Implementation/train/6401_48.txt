funny how many of the person
who say
this is far superior to romero 's version tend to be very young
( judging by their other post ) .
what we have here is a slick 
action packed 
gory and `` whoopee '' filled 2 hour mtv video .
frantic editing 
pop-video camera work 
`` cool '' music blah blah blahactually
it are not bad compared to other recent remake
( chainsaw massacre was a total disaster ) ...
pretty good acting all round ,
totally predictable in the `` who will die next '' stake and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name
that will generate plenty of revenue
alone by fan of the original
who will go
and see it out of curiosity ...
do not remake of classic get on your nerve ?
can they really not come up with something original ?
why remake dawn of the dead ?
the thing
that made the original special
( the middle segment kid think
is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how
when you get everything you ever wanted you still are not happy )
are totally missing .
this is an action flick 
plain and simple .
the faster the better .
if you are into action flick
( and as this ,
the 2004 version is well done )
fair enough 
but for anyone
who likes a little substance to their film ...
get ready to sigh
( again )
... watch the cinemas over the next few year
as we get the godfather series
remade by whoever the most fashionable pop director
is at the moment ,
and star war remade 
with all the kid saying
how the new version is mile better cos the old version is slow and boring
and holds a camera shot for more than 5 second ... not bad ,
but in 10 year they will still be discussing the romero version 
not this pap
