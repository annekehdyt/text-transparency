there have been so many many film
based on the same theme .
single cute girl needs handome boy to impress ex ,
pays him and then
( guess what ? )
she falls in love with him ,
there is a bit of fumbling
followed by a row
before everyone makes up
before the happy ending ... ...
this has been done many times.the thing is i knew this
before starting to watch .
but ,
despite this ,
i was still looking forward to it .
in the right hand 
with a good cast and a ight script
it can still be a pleasant way
to pass a couple of hours.this
was none of these.this was dire.a female lead lacking in charm or wit
who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me .
i truly did not care
if she `` got her man '' or remained single and unhappy.a male lead
who 
after a few of his endless word of wisdom 
i wanted to kill .
just to remove that smug look .
i had no idea
that leading a life of a male whore was the path
to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment.a
totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic character .
none of them seemed to have job ,
all of them had more money than sense 
a idegroom
who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning
that his ide slept with his best friend ... .plus `` i would miss you
even if we had never met '' ! ! ! ! !
i could go on
but i have just realised
that i am wasting even more time on this dross ... ..i could rant about introducing a character
just to have a very cheap laugh at the name `` woody '' but in truth
that was the only remotely humorous thing
that happened in the film .
