the french film `` extension du domaine de la lutte ''
directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel
is based on the book of the same name
written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq.he
has also worked on this film 's scenario.according to british cinema magazine sight and sound ,
it is also known as `` whatever '' .this film has been hailed as a eath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politic
and its implication on two stupid information technology workers.the film is marred by its much too evident voice
over which introduces us to the main character.this makes us viewer feel
as if we are watching a book
that is ing read .
the basic premise of problem
related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought
is fine
but the film goes out of hand
once the hero starts recounting the misery
faced by him and his friend.instead of sticking to its main topic the film veer in other direction leading to its downfall.beware :
some woman viewer might find not only the film but even its two hero as moronic misogynist .
