you would be forgiven to think
a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie
( especially one entirely located inside a us prison )
- see this to prove yourself wrong !
it was produced in the 80 's after all
and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert
( something i think
anyone would really notice nowaday what with practically everyone
being accustomed to $ 100m+ budget for action movie
unfortunately dominating the industry mind ! )
being mr harlin 's first major production and the -
at least what nowaday would be considered a stellar - cast .
i still think
most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard 's screen appearance
( not mentioning the well overrated mr
( s )
bergman directorial effort )
- at least for all female viewer -
but this flick really proves
there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood
to make us watch a film in suspense .
do try and watch this movie
even if you are not a horror puff ,
imo it is definitely worth it !
