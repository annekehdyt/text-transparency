this was a watchable movie ,
but plot was a little weak
and most of the joke were from some of rodney 's earlier movie .
with that said ,
it was worth the time to watch .
i gave this a 5/10 .
so basically 
its one of those movie
that you do
not go out of your way to see ,
but
if you find it on the tube ,
take a chance .
