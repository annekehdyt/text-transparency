martin weisz ,
who directed the solid `` rohtenburg '' ,
will be taking the heat ,
with wes craven 
for another shabby `` the hill have eye 2 '' .
the memory of the legendary original ,
which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog
having a flashback ,
will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake
( in name only ) .
a bunch of national guardsman
( and woman )
are sent to a desert research area
surrounded by hill
filled with mutant .
one by one the weekend soldier are picked off .
that is it .
there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably utal rape scene ,
but there is precious little else
to get excited about .
the film 's `` hero '' are the usual bunch of clich\u00e9s and the mutant 
a far cry from craven 's original `` family '' 
mostly resemble brian thompson from `` coa ''
coupled with some creature stan winston had left over from the `` wrong turn '' shoot .
much of the action takes place in cave ,
ala `` the descent '' ,
and is well shot by sam mccurdy .
a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan craven 's addition of a sympathetic mutant
who skulks around his cave like leatherface in hooper 's original `` chainsaw '' .
weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle ,
but he is not really at fault
because he does his best to maintain suspense
and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situation .
not a fan 
unfortunately .
