i have to confess right off
that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield .
indeed 
from me he gets `` no respect . ''
i watched this
only because my wife wanted to see it ,
and found exactly what i expected :
a stupid story
without any real humour .
it is full of lame 
crude joke and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer 's
( dangerfield )
plans to build a ski resort in utah
that just did not capture my attention at all.in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast ,
including the like of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner
( i did not even know
he was still around
until i saw his name in the credit for this .
) this truly is a dangerfield disaster.2/10
