i can not believe
how popular this show is .
i consider myself an avid sci-fi fan .
i have read countless sci-fi novel
and have enjoyed many sci-fi movie and tv show .
i really would not even consider this true sci-fi .
every episode i have sat through was like a lame 
watered down version of a star trek episode 
minus anything
that might make it interesting or exciting.it is basically a bunch of person
standing around in army fatigue ,
talking about something boring ,
who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet
that looks just like earth 
with person
who look and sound just like human !
it seemed extremely low budget .
the character are all forgettable one dimensional cutout ,
and the many attempt at humor fall flat .
it reminds me
when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it ,
trying to be funny ,
but he is not .
it is just sad.the movie was terrible as well .
there is so much
you can do with a portal through space ,
yet every place the army person go is boring !
this show no imagination !
i actually thought the tv series `` alien nation '' from a few year back
( based on the movie alien nation )
was much better .
that show actually had good story line and decent character .
i was not crazy about `` alien nation '' ,
but compared to this overrated crap ,
it was great !
also 
unlike the great new `` battlestar galactica '' series 
`` stargate '' copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely !
they should have at least updated the cheesy `` toilet flushing '' special effect
of whenever somebody goes through the stargate .
