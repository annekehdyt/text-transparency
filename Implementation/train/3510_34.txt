i found 'time at the top ' an entertaining and stimulating experience .
the acting ,
while not generally illiant ,
was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good .
as a film obviously
aimed at the younger demographic ,
it is certainly one of the better work in the genre
( child 's sci-fi ) .
normally 
i would say
that canada 
the united kingdom and australia produce the best movie and tv show for child ,
and 'time at the top ' does nothing to discount this theory !
i do not think
that continuity and great acting are important to younger person .
a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them .
both are in abundance in this film .
the special effect are good ,
without detracting from the story ,
or closing the viewer off from their own imagination .
it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film ,
but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre ' .
the setting and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie ,
and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy .
overall 
this film is highly satisfactory ,
and i recommend it to all viewer
who can see the world through child 's eye 
or those
that try to ,
like myself !
now 
i really must read the original book 
as soon as possible .
