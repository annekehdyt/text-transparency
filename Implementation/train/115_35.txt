roman polanski has made many 
many movie
that are unexceptional .
his fame bewilder me .
nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown
( i have not seen 'knife in the water ' or 'tess ' ) .
any contribution he is made to film concluded more than twenty year ago ;
his work is just embarrassing 
safe and/or dull
( the pianist 
frantic 
oliver twist 
the ninth gate 
pirate )
.r 's baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time
it came out .
it is lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror ' movie
( never show the baby ) .
but this is just misconceived horror sap .
everything is arty to the point
that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early
( um 
thank for that finale-destroying title ) ,
and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for day .
it did not sustain my interest .
i find
that whatever this movie might have been ,
it is utterly derailed by the 1960 's version of what femininity was .
farrow is such a chronic distracted 
helpless waif/housewife .
her frailty is oversold ...
she is irritating in the extreme .
there is no real idea
in it ... nothing to consider
except being the mother of the devil.the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential .
