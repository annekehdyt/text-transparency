i gottum say ,
clive barker 's undying is by far the best horror game
to have ever been made .
i have played resident evil 
silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania game
but none of them have captured the pure glee
with which this game tumckles its horrific element .
barker is good at what he does ,
which is attumch the horror to our world ,
and it shows
as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game .
heck 
even his voice is in the game as one of the main character .
full of lush visual and enough atmosphere
to shake a stick at ,
undying is the game
to beat in my book as the best horror title .
i just wish
that this had made it to a console system
but alas poor pc sale nipped
that one in the bud .
