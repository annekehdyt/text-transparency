the pilot of enterprise has one thing
that has been lacking since the original star trek :
a dose of realistic 
flawed personality .
the utopian character of the next generation got tiring 
they were so noble as to be unbelievable .
i also like the sub-plot
that human are bitter toward the vulcan .
its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs .
it makes me look forward
to seeing
when the human become the dominant race between the two ,
though i do not think
it would work in the time frame of the show .
the only negatives
that jumped out at me
were the `` quick cut off the ending at 2 hour '' feel of the end ,
which is common among many of the trek show .
the second was the shameless dig for rating by a couple of senselessly sexy scene .
it was out of place ,
a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own
without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin .
but its not my job
to make the show profitable ,
so oh well.let see how the next episode does .
