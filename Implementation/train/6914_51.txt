i am a huge randolph scott fan ,
but this film is a dud .
the whole thing has a canned 
fake ,
soundstage feel to it ,
with truly awful rear-screen projection .
it has a good plot idea
that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script ,
which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the character .
the directing is pedestrian ,
and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it .
i have seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable `` soundstage production '' before ,
but this is not one of them .
all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott/boetticher film
all the more.randolph scott is tanned 
trim 
and shine
that million dollar smile throughout .
he is always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his film .
aside from scott 
the other main reason
i wanted to see this movie
was due
to how much i enjoyed ms. wymore in errol flynn 's movie 
`` rocky mountian '' .
in `` man behind the gun '' ,
she is just as beautiful ,
and you can tell
she is a good actress ,
but she was forced to say some pretty dumb line ,
and the blocking
she was given by the director
was truly awful .
i have only seen phil carey in `` operation pacific '' ,
and he plays the exact same character here ...
an arrogant pain-in-the-butt you want to beat into unconsciousness .
i guess
it proves he is a good actor ...
he made me hate him .
there are some lame attempt at comic relief
that only detract from the film 
in my opinion .
although there are many element to knock ,
i must say
that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish song
sung in the musical number ...
but that is not why we go to see randolph scott movie 
right ?
there are definitely worse scott film out there ,
and this one certainly is not unbearable ,
but it also certainly could not be deemed anything beyond mediocre .
