being a fan of andy goldsworthy 's art for a while now ,
and owning some of his book 
i had some expectation of what i would see .
what i got was something completely satisfying ,
and quite a bit more than i expected .
being an artist myself
( i work in clay ) ,
finding inspiration within our surrounding
to make good art
is imperative ,
and it is something
andy goldsworthy has mastered .
following him over the course of a year ,
the director captures the spontaneous energy 
skill 
and devotion to the artist connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair .
the music
set to the film
is emacing and intoxicating .
if you are an artist in need of inspiration 
or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience ,
then see this movie .
i for one am glad to know
that andy is somewhere out there .
creating 
dancing 
wrestling with the force of nature
to make our world more beautiful .
