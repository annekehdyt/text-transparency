being the first feature film with robert de niro
( although not released for year later ) ,
this is worth the watch .
de niro 's role is not huge 
yet amusing as one of two friend
who first try to prevent another friend marriage
only to later chase him down
to force him into it .
any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today .
