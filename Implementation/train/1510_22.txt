i have watched 3 episode of caveman ,
and i have no idea
why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better .
to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercial 
with no real humor .
as we sat around watching these show ,
we all speculated on what was going to happen.the episode of the woman cave-woman with a attitude
was actually a big 
yea right 
for us .
she is crude in a theater and acts tough to stranger ,
and truth be told ,
she needed a slapi
consider myself a pretty good reviewer ,
taking in everything ,
but i must say ,
caveman is comparable to the old show 
my mother 
the car .
i give it a 2 ,
only because they deserve 1 better than a 1
because they actually spent money on it .
