i did not know
this was a silent movie with narration .
i do not care for silent movie
- the corny humor 
flickering lighting and film 
etc .
i am sure
that attributes to the low score i assigned it .
it was about chapter 8
before i found any interest in this story
and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen .
maybe this appeal to the sci-fi crowd ?
the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a ain transplant .
i went with two other person on a friday night
and there were a total of 6 person in the entire theater .
isabella rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie .
no one left commenting
how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach
to telling this story .
i can not recommend this movie .
