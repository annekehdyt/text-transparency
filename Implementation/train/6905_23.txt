i do not understand
why the reviews of this film are so universally bad ,
unless i am just off my rocker .
i found it sick 
illiant 
twisted 
and psychologically sophisticated .
you will not get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one .
it has layer within layer 
nuanced
acting by stone ,
and a plot
that will keep you guessing
even after it is over .
person need to get over the fact
that sharon stone is 48 ,
and that michael douglas is not in this one .
i predict
that this film will be a huge hit on dvd
once person see it for themselves
and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewer put out .
give it a shot ,
you might be glad you did !
