had never heard of the man in the moon
until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel .
look 
my taste is like any other ' 
eclectic .
my favorite run from blue velvet to dr. strangelove to the ghost and mrs. muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one 
eraserhead 
repo man ,
and the spy within.the man in the moon is superbly made 
a gentle hearted 
joyous and tragic film 
beautifully filmed 
one
in which the actor truly live in the moment rather than act .
this sweet tale shortly will be in our private liary .
this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting.it is hard to remain stoic during the film 's last moment ,
particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister 's heart searing private pain and forgives all.rather
than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose ,
will end now with this suggestion from one
who enjoys film
which speak from the heart
to ours.if you purchase no other film 
please ,
purchase the man in the moon .
this moving story is one you will enjoy reliving time and again .
it is a joy and a gem 
a film
all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts.the simple virtue evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold.paul vincent zecchinomanasota key
