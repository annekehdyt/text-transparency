wonderfully put together..i wish
there was a follow up to this documantary
to follow up with the life of some and celeate the life of other lost ...
there should be a part two..a real one .
it was great..the film was not long enough..i would like to know
why the creator of the film did not follow up ! !
this is so important to the community period..well
if your are reading this please consider
doing another documantary of this sort ... i
am really tired of hearing from naive writer
how aid and man go together
when they do not ;
actually its the hetero 's
that
we need to look into..this film
did not even bother to mantion hiv or aid and i was so glad for that..i really appreciated the eak down and definition too .
thank you s much for allowing this film to exist .
