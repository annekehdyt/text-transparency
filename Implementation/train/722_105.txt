welcome to our town ,
welcome to your town ?
as we are introduced into the world of its townfolk of 1901 america ,
this three act play is opened before us with the help of `` the stage manager '' 
a visual narrator
if you like .
after his initial introduction 
we are lead into the home of two particular family ;
the webb 's and the gibb's.this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century 
and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtone
that can seem a little biased in this dream town .
here we see the everyday life of some of its 2642 populace of grover 's corner 
new hampshire ,
even if there are 
too 
the migrant polish worker
that add another 500
to is number ,
they 
never get a look-in.once the daily life of these family have been introduced ;
wife cooking 
child home-working 
father working 
kid falling in love and the clean picket-fence painted white ,
the second act is started three year later 
after young george
( a young and unrecognisable william holden ,
then aged 22 )
and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry .
blossoming lovebird reaching for the star and reaching 
too 
a turning point in their own life 
from the nest
they lived
and now 
into the anxiety and wo of young adulthood they nervously step .
the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding ,
it is in this act
that the movie intentions become apparent ,
here we see not life 
not celeation but death ,
and it is in this predicament
that the dead ,
as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past ,
are here to remind us ,
to tell us ,
that life 
and every last minute 
every precious eath is not to be wasted and squandered.it is in this last third
that the movie own political stance also seems more apparent too 
feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on 
and by 
middle america
and how it should direct its home
and how it should also put it in order .
this is not just about `` our '' town ,
this is moral diction
aimed at `` our '' souls
and how america can better itself if its person ' ,
( excluding the pole 
the irish 
the native american and the freed ethnic minority ' 
and minority ' in general 
plus the supporting backbone of the americana 's who 
still 
have not had a fair part in this narrative ) ,
such as the middle class 
can live up to the expectation of the american dream through honest 
decent living .
the purveyor of the american dream with special invitation only.i was entertained 
slightly 
by this movie too ,
but i felt
that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else
that took part in it albeit the bland acting ,
the musical score or how well 
or not 
it was made .
this was the movie intention
to exclude other group ,
and to only include the like of the webb 's and the gibb 's 
in the future of the developing country of the usa 
a good movie 
but also a slightly biased in its stance 
i thought.taken from the play by us ' born thornton wilder
( 1897 - 1975 )
this pulitzer prize winning play ,
and six academy award nominated movie ,
was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attribute ;
life 
love and death ,
the play translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness .
our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness 
like other town 
nothing too exciting ever happens here ,
if anything at all ,
this town only has the `` right sort of person '' ,
you can still leave your back-door unlocked here ,
we are seeing the developing life of these two family ,
but it is their moral and social stance
that is more important than them themselves .
our town may just have been `` any town '' ,
just as long
as you came from the right part of town
that is .
