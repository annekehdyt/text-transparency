this film was a big disappointment.i take the opposite view of the critic .
this is not a case of the material
not being up to the level of the actor ;
here the actor
( bette davis and jame cagney )
are simply not up to the level of the material .
clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney ,
and look
how it happened
one night turned out - an all-time classic .
with a very similar story 
davis prove
that she has no talent for comedy
( good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy
she ever attempted ! )
davis ' one-note performance oozes petulance 
but none of the nuance of colbert 's acting in it happened one night .
cagney ,
who was a great comedy actor ,
just seems out-of-sync with his costar 
davis .
the script provides some decent line and gag ,
but the delivery seems better suited to drama
than comedy.part of the problem is the soundtrack ,
which 
like the delivery of davis and cagney 
seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.jack carson ,
who played similar role throughout his career ,
has more capably handled very similar material .
in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance .
in a slightly different role as an old west relic 
harry davenport 
is very good .
but in one of his poorest performance 
william frawley is quite irritating .
his character 's constant reference to fictional cop are a poor effort at irony .
i really love every one of these performer ,
and it is a shame
that 
as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result
than the bride came c.o.d .
