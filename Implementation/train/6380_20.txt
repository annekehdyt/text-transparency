really excellent movie ,
one of the best i have seen .
touching and simple - just like life ,
sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh
and it is just beautiful .
not too much of anything ,
just as it is suppose to be .
really loved the idea of the movie ,
noone is bad or good ,
all or just person ,
sometimes make mistake mostly because of society 's pressure ,
everyone try to stay strong and some succeed more than other and the most important thing is that you do not have reason
to get angry -
you can do it ,
but eventually the anger goes away
and then you to need to let love come back
in although it is hard ,
there lies the true happiness.great actor and cast ,
the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie.nice nice nice.i recommend to see it ,
especially if you like to see italian ' life ...
