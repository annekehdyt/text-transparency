this is an excellent film for female body-builder and female action fan !
i think
that sue price did a great job in this film series
( nemesis 2,3,4 )
and proved to be a great fighter .
she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron
to resist the powerful nebula
( nemesis 2 ) .
though not a film of great value and sue price 's acting skill not the best to have met in my life ,
the movie itself was something awesome 
a priceless gem for fan of female body-builder action !
well 
some part of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi film 
such as terminator or predator ,
but that is not the point .
the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder
who put all of her energy and body talent
to show us the best
she can do .
i really enjoyed that film
and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3
( a rather boring sequel )
and nemesis 4
( a much more interesting sequel than 3 ) .
what a pity it has not shown yet on dvd : -
