overall the film is ok. i think
it is better than sepet and much better than gua in term of its story ,
its sentimental value.there are a few scene
that makes me touched .
yes i agree
that the boy
( mukhsin )
did his acting very good .
brilliant .
i can say
that his acting is almost natural.however 
the song 'ne me quitte pa ' by nina simone really `` 'menaikkan ' my 'bulu ' 'roma ' `` .i love the song .
both the song .
`` ne me quitte pa '' and `` hujan '' .
i just downloaded the song .
beautiful.and salute to yasmin .
the movie 's ending credit makes me touched again .
we can see
how yasmin really appreciated her parent in an unique way.i
think
the movie deserves
that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival.i give 8.5 out of 1o star .
