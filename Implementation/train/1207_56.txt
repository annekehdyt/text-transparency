when i first saw this show ,
i thought
it looked interesting .
i watched it ,
saw
how it revolved around sarah ,
like the character sees
the world ... revolving around her .
i got it ,
but was not laughing very much.onstage and in her show ,
she is racist 
crude 
insensitive and hugely self-centered .
i did not get her at first ,
and took it all at face value .
then i got to see her movie ,
jesus is magic .
i think
that served as a sarah silverman primer for me ,
explaining to me just what 'language '
she is speaking .
she is like marilyn manson ,
working so hard
to give us a faceful of horrible idea and image ,
but you eventually realise
it is not an assault ,
it is a statement .
and once you understand that ,
you find you are glad someone 's finally
giving it to you straight.i do not mean to suggest only smart person
will understand ,
or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy .
while i like a lot of 'smart ' show ,
i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm .
i get the impression
that it is good ,
but i just do not get it .
many person will never get the sarah silverman program ,
but i am glad i eventually came around.the creator of this show do work hard ,
every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot 
but with song 
or dream sequence 
production number .
these person are not putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertiser ,
they appear to be on a mission
to make the best show
they can put together .
if i was to predict the future of this show ,
i would say
it will go the way of arrested development and freak and geek .
it will get canceled
before it is time and live on in fan ' heart and on dvd .
but take heart 
ssp creator ,
your audience is out there ,
and we will be watching for as long as they let you make the show .
