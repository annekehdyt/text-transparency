the perfect son is a story about two 30-something other 
one
who is seemingly `` perfect '' and the other
who is basically a screw-up ,
frequently landing himself in drug rehab center .
after the death of their father 
the two are ought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurface .
it is not until the `` perfect '' other makes the startling revelation
that he has aid
that the irresponsible younger other finally makes a move
to get his life in order ,
and take some responsibility.the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger other 's `` comeback '' ,
though it may seem a bit far-fetched at time
( beating drug addiction is never so easy ) .
what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aid 
a topic
that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 year .
and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding other is very believable and well-done .
the two main actor were both very competent ,
if not terribly charismatic.a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger
whose own other died of aid .
the ending is nicely done as well .
