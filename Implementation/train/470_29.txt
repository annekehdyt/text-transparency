this must be one of the worst movie
i
have ever seen .
i was actually expecting a bad movie
but i was caught by surprise believe it or not .
the storyline is the traditional ,
all clich\u00e9e are included.the dialogue is so poorly written
that you actually laugh
when the otherwise half-descent actor are trying to make it sound real .
the photo is not too good ,
the music is so malplac\u00e9e
it actually made me angry ,
the actor are not even trying ,
altho the script makes
it almost impossible
you could expect more from person
that have been acting for 30 year
and the so
called action scene
actually manage to lack the `` action '' itself.i do not understand
why these type of bad movie keep on coming ,
who is financing this shit ?
where is the screening ?
and why on earth do actor take on this mission impossible script ?
there are a million hollywood-movie in this genre
without even aspiration of reaching the theater ,
but even them straight to video thing actually manages to look professional in comparison.i can not say anything positive about this except the title
which explains it all ,
i feel robbed of 2 hour of my life .
