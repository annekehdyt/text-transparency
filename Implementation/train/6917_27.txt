they should have called this movie :
`` adopted mouse brother
that is slightly inspired by someone 's vague recollection of stuart little
who just kind of skimmed the book a little ,
but mostly just remembered the cover ''
if it was not so misleading i would give it a better review.but seriously person ,
do your kid a favor
and have them read the book .
they might actually learn something
instead of having their mind numbed
by what we all know
as hollywood film.the book stuart little is not about a mouse ,
it is about a person
who happens to be very small and mouse-like .
he is born to his parent 
not adopted .
the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home
and the journey he embarks on .
there is a cat named snowball
who thinks
he is food and wants to eat him ,
but snowball can not talk .
in the movie they screw all of that up .
i think
the only thing
that they kept from the book
were the boat race and the name .
