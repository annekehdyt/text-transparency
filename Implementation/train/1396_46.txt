saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca .
my god 
what was the director thinking ?
film professor should use this film as a case study
on what not to do
when making a short film .
first off 
this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .
the film takes place partially in `` the waystation '' 
some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere ,
where nothing really takes place.the acting is beyond bad .
so bad in fact
that i almost thought
it was a comedy .
the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn film .
there is one or two decent performance ,
including the guy
who played jacob and fenner
but it is like the director had no clue
on how to work or use his thespian .
the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue ,
which bordered on absurd .
the writer
( whom i assume
is also the director )
writes each character
like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.the overall production value
is pretty good ,
but to be honest ,
with a film this bad it is easy to overlook it .
the production design is pretty good ,
although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar .
the costume and make-up are okay ,
and i understand
the production was working with a low budget .
it is just when the character speak ,
or they try and push the plot forward ,
the film unravel into a muck of crap.as i have said ,
this film is god awful .
it is like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi film
and threw all the part he liked into a blender
and came up with this .
my only hope is that he used other person 's money on this ,
because
if he used his own ,
he is a total sucker .
