my friend and i walked out after 15 minute ,
and we were not the first .
afterward 
we tried to get our money back .
movie theater management would not allow this ,
but they did agree to let us see another film .
the only time
that worked for us
was to see dickie robert :
former child star .
as you can tell ,
this was not a memorable night .
probably one of my worst movie night .
close second has to be
when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist .
in conclusion 
for the sake of humanity 
please do not see the order .
