except for the brady variety hour 
this was some of the hokiest television i have seen in a while .
the video production quality were not too bad ,
but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80 's .
and marie osmond look like she did battle with the avon lady..
and lost big time .
way too much eyeliner.it was kind of embarrassing to watch veteran danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this .
even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase
that would be opening 'in about a year .
'as of this writing
it is 17 year later
and it has not opened yet
( unless you count disney 's animal kingdom . )
all in all though 
for all the shortcoming 
this still an interesting visual piece of disney history .
