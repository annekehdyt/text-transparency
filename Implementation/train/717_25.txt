i rented this movie about 3 year ago ,
and it still stands out in my mind
as the worst movie ever made .
i do not think
i ever finished it .
it is worse than a home video
made by a high school student .
i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something
and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt 
oakley sunglass and a newer suv 
like a toyota rav-4 or something
( i do not remember ) .
i do not understand
how they could have possibly said
that to be in the 70s .
he might have had a cell phone too 
i can not remember ,
it was just horrible .
i returned it to the video store
and asked them why
they even carry the movie
and if i could get the hour of my life back .
to this day it is the worst movie i
have ever seen ,
and i have seen some pretty bad one .
