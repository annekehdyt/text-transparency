i saw this film under the title of `` tied up '' .
in general i have enjoyed dolph 's movie ,
so gave this one a try .
it was not worth it .
i have read some of the previous comment about the box enticing viewer .
do not be fooled .
this is a poor film at best .
the acting is nonexistent .
the plot ,
what little there is of one ,
is very predictable .
the movie in place seems to be chopped together .
this one just plain stink the place up .
not even worth the price of a cheap night rental .
as a bit of a dolph fan 
i kept waiting to see him in action .
by the end of the movie 
you will still be waiting .
best to avoid this film ,
and spend your time watching almost anything else .
