it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many level .
the script 
the acting 
the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling .
the costume 
set and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful .
in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film ,
once i had accepted
that it was not going to be any good .
it seems a shame
that person would spend so much time and effort
producing something so poor ,
when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise
( albeit not very believable !
) ,
but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragon and knight ,
that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy film .
let 's just hope
that the lord of the ring is a bit better !
oh 
and david thewlis ' haircut makes him look like he-man .
it does !
