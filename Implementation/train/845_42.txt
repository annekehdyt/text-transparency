well i too had heard read all the eathless review and comment about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar
so i went to see it today .
what a major disappointment !
1 )
if you read the other review
you will learn from member of the u.s. military
who served in iraq
how unlikely the event of this movie are .
they mirrored my own thought ;
as the movie played i - a complete civilian -
kept thinking to myself ,
`` say what ?
there is no way
that would happen like that.. '' 2 )
there is very little
that actually happens in term of plot .
a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one
who was killed
( a death
that is not really clearly explained ) .
the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work .
his attitude puts other at risk .
that is it !
3 ) this movie is nowhere near
as suspenseful as claimed .
if you want suspense try one of the bourne movie .
if you want to see a war movie
that is emotionally powerful ,
try renting go tell the spartan ,
which is about the vietnam war ,
and star burt lancaster
( who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter
that it was a film
he was immensely proud of and one
he viewed as some of his finest work ,
and
which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over-hyped apocalypse now ) 
or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark ,
which 
especially for an english film 
is unbelievably heart-wrenching .
do not waste your time on hurt locker .
