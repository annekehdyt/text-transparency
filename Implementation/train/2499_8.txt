nothing could have saved this movie ,
not even superman.ten year ago the special effect would have been amazing .
better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performance out of the actor .
but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it .
plot hole 
bad line 
terrible pacing ,
endless replaying of the same shot of a cgi dragon stomping through hallway ... ugh.avoid this one at all cost .
