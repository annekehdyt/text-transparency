i really enjoyed the 60 's .
not being of that generation
( i am waiting for `` the 80 's '' )
it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era.one major problem in the movie 
however ,
was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the family .
according to promos i
saw for the movie on nbc ,
the story was basically about two family struggling with issue in 1960 's america .
now 
i may have missed something ,
but i think
we learned more about the white family than the african american family.i really think
that the 60 's use music to describe the scene better than any dialogue
that could come out of the mouth of the actor
( all of which are very talented . )
this is very visible at the end of the first part
( about two hour in )
of the mini-series.very good movie !
