an excellent film depicting the cross current in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary person in the rural pacific northwest .
solid directing and writing along with fine acting 
especially the performance by kwami taha and dan stowe .
interestingly 
this film was made in the same year as the highly successful `` crash 
'' written and directed by paul haggis .
the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angele ,
and the character may seem to be better acquainted with each other in `` apart from that 
''
but the personal relationship of the character are as flawed and troubled and their story as resonant as any of those in `` crash . ''
for those viewer
who appreciated `` crash '' this
is a must see film .
also 
fan of jim jarmusch and john cassavete will like this movie .
