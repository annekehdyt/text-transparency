every movie critic and metal head hated this movie
but i enjoyed it .
i saw this as a child on tv somewhere
and was amazed by the scene
where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway.the movie itself was typical 80 's ,
guy gets pushed around by bully and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bully
but goes to far
and has to be destroyed.matt from melrose place pick on skippy from family ty
so skippy gets a record of tony field from gene simmon to comfort him and all hell eak lose 
the highlight
being where tony sing
( lip-synchs )
and dances to a metal song
before the shyt hits
the fan.there were a lot of error and stuff
but the music and the overall imagery was enough
to keep my fist pumping 8/10
