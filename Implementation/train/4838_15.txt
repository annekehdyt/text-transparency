this movie is not schlock ,
despite the lo fi production and its link to troma production .
a dark fable for adult .
exploitation is a theme of sugar cookie ,
and one wonder
if the cast has not fallen prey
to said theme .
a weird movie with enticing visual :
shadow and contrast are prominent .
definitely worth a look 
especially from fan of warhol and stylish decadence .
through all the cruelty and wickedness 
a moral 
albeit twisted 
can be gleamed .
