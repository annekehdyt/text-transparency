the first installmant of this notorious horror series presents a woman
being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad man
who torture her for several day
before finally killing her.she is beaten savagely 
spun around in the chair endlessly ,
has her finger nail pulled ,
animal gut are thrown at her 
hot boiling water is poured on her
and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle
( really sick and nasty scene ) .the maker of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible
and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film
you can get
without committing murder on tape.of course some of the special effect are rather poor but the idea
of making a snuff is pretty gruesome.i
have seen also `` flower of flesh and blood ''
which is more gory and sadistic 
but less disturbing.anyway ,
this one is a must-see for horror fan !
