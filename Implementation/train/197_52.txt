i have not actually finished the film .
you may say
that in this case i have no right to review it 
especially so negatively .
but i do ,
only because i stopped it on account of i could not watch anymore ...
i got over halfway ,
and i only got there
by promising myself something good was just around the corner .
this film is so tiresome ,
so lackluster
that i was actually insulted .
i have not read many of the other review ,
so i am not sure
if there are other homosexual teen
who have suffered through it ,
but i am homosexual 
and i did go through `` similar '' revelation 
day dream 
issue etc etc .
there were maybe two moment
where i actually felt this film could go somewhere ,
where i felt
it may have some inkling of meaning 
or relativity ,
but these hope were dashed the moment
the next set of clich\u00e9-ridden narration came on .
i mean 
just look at the quote on the imdb page .
unfortunately you are not able to hear the scratchy play back ,
nor the echo-ey fade if you are just read the quote ,
because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss .
i did give the film three star ,
and all three of those star go to the film cinematographer
who did a fantastic job
attempting to transform archer 's tired `` concept '' into something watchable .
mind you 
i pray he was not the one
who decided to include all the long shot of tv closeup ...
another unnecessary clich\u00e9 already over done in film such as korine 's gummo ... i think
it is extremely fitting
that this film premiered at sundance
( only because archer had connection in the festival via volunteer work
he did ,
by the way ... )
because sundance seems to be the one festival
where clich\u00e9 heavy drivel like this is still accepted as `` arthouse '' .
no 
it is not art house ,
i am afraid
it is just plain s**t-house .
do not watch .
