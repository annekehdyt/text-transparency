`` the brain machine '' will at least put your own ain into overdrive
trying to figure out
what it is all about .
four subject of varying background and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researcher as a scientific study of man and environment .
since the only common denominator among them is the fact
that they each have no
known family should have been a tip off -
none of them will be missed.the whole affair
is supervised by a mysterious creep
known only as the general ,
but it seems he is taking his direction from a senator
who wishes to remain anonymous .
good call there on the senator 's part .
there is also a shadowy guard
that the camera constantly zooms in on ,
who later claims
he does not take his direction from the general or 'the project ' .
too bad he was not more effective ,
he was overpowered rather easily
before the whole thing went kablooey.if nothing else ,
the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970 's technology
featuring repeated shot of dial phone 
room size computer and a teletype machine
that will not quit .
perhaps that was the basis of the film 's alternate title - `` time warp '' ;
nothing else would make any sense .
as for myself 
i would like to consider a title
suggested by the murdered dr. krisner 's experiment
titled 'group stress project ' .
it applies to the film 's actor and viewer alike.keep an eye out just above the general 's head at poolside
when he asks an agent for his weapon ,
a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.you may want to catch this flick
if you are a die hard gerald mcraney fan ,
could he have ever been that young ?
jame best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend ,
but do not call him father .
for something a little more up his alley 
try to get your hand on 1959 's `` the killer shrews '' .
that one at least does not pretend to take itself so seriously .
