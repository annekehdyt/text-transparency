it is a shame
this movie is so hard to get your hand on in the us .
i found it through a rare video dealer ,
and it was certainly worth it .
this is ,
without a doubt ,
the best film made during the pre-code era 
and the finest film of the 1930s .
masterful director frank borzage made wonderful film about the depression ,
and with man 's castle
he created a fairy tale
amidst
the hardship of the era.loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them ,
and they help make this movie a wonderful romance .
young 's trina is sweet and hopeful ,
while tracy 's bill is gruff and closed-off .
the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult ,
but in the end rewarding relationship on film.man 's castle is the most soft-focus pre-code film
i have seen .
borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique
to turn the squatter 's village
where bill and trina live into a palace .
the hardship of the depression are never ignored ,
in fact they are integral to the film .
but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale ,
the love between the character makes the situation seem less harsh .
it makes the film warm
and affectionate.man 's castle is the crowning achievement of the pre-code era .
if only more person could see it .
