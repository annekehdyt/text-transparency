whoa .
in the twin city 
we have a station
that shows a `` big bad movie '' monday through friday .
tonight 's nugget was a film with carrie fisher
called `` she is back '' about a really annoying woman
who ends up getting murdered
when thugs eak into her house .
bea
( beatrice )
comes back to haunt her husband .
she wants him to seek revenge on her killer ,
hence `` she is back '' .
and she will not let him rest
until he does so .
she irritates him endlessly ... and the viewer 
too !
this movie is truly one of the worst movie i
have ever seen .
hey 
i like bad movie ,
though ( my fave movie is xanadu ) .
i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film ,
wondering
who thought
this would be a good idea for a movie .
bea is just so annoying .
the plot is silly ;
the acting is bad ;
the story ... well ,
you get my drift .
anyway ,
if you wan na see a really bad movie -
really really bad movie ,
check this one out .
you will not be disappointed .
heh .
