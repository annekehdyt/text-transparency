like other person
who commanted on `` fr\u00e4ulein doktor '' i
stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv
without having heard of it before .
the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy
but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trench on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning.to
me this is one of the five best movie about wwi
( the other are `` all quiet on the western front '' 
`` path of glory '' 
`` gallipoli '' and the post-war `` la vie et rien d'autre '' ) .
and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling ;
the horse and man appear like rider of the apocalypse with their gas masks.i
only wish
i had taped the film .
