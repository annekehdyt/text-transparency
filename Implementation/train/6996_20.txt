i saw this film by accident
and this movie was an accident ...
well it must of been .
blonde woman
being stalked ,
the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute 's then disappearing and reappearing 
hiding.he was'nt even a super hero
so i do not know
how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat
and that is not hard to do.the old `` mirror in the bathroom '' is just not scary anymore
in fact it stopped being scary year ago .
you had the cop on the trail of the villain 
another clich\u00e9
( played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent ,
he is from london )
the director did'nt have a clue
and has made a film full of clich\u00e9 's
and make 's `` scary move ''
which was a comedy look scary .
pathetic !
