it was nice to see all the familiar character again ,
but the story bothered me .
we loved ariel in the first movie-
so why is the second one centered around her daughter ?
the new character were annoying
and i did not like the plot of this .
worst of all 
christopher daniel barne did not come back as the voice of eric !
disney 
please stop remaking classic movie with these shoddy imitation .
