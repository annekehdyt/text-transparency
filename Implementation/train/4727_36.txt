first off 
i am a huge fan of 80s movie 
and of jennifer conelly as well .
so yesterday 
i wandered into a local used book/movie store
and found a vhs copy .
i read the back
and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 ,
it was a good deal .
so i took it home
and popped it in the vcr .
what a sweet movie !
at my age now 
i relate more to movie like about last night or st. elmo 's fire ,
but still i remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy 
etc .
we all have those little crush
when we are younger .
and if it does not work out ,
we are heartoken and we think
that we will never get over it .
but of course we do .
many time .
it is that sort of sweet quality
that i really got from this movie .
the feeling of `` oooh !
i remember
when something like that happened to me ... ''
is all through it .
the character are interesting and well-developed .
i recommend it to anyone
who likes 80s movie 
teen film in particular 
or to anyone
who just wants to go back
and remember a simpler time in their life .
