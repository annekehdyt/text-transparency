the devil dog :
hound of hell is really good film .
it has good acting by the cast
including richard crenna and r.g .
armstrong.the music is spooky and gives that devilish chill ! i liked the effect on the dog and i think
the creature itself looked really cool with its horn 
frill like part on his neck ,
and acted really viscous !
if you like horror film
and have not seen the devil dog :
hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film
then do so
because its a good movie and i do not think
you will be disappointed !
