i am never much for classic film .
movie like patton 
going my way ,
how green was my valley ,
the godfather 
casablanca 
annie hall 
gone with the wind 
lawrence of arabia ,
and citizen kane bore me .
however 
i would much rather watch any one of those film 3,469 time
while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever .
if i did the latter ,
i would probably be sleeping the entire time.the color art direction
and the music did not interest me 
gershwin or non-gershwin .
the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep .
the dialogue does not match up to singin ' in the rain .
basically 
this movie is boring .
the only other film
that i fell asleep
while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid .
but you can not blame me .
i only slept 5 minute the night before.1 star/10
( too bad we can not give zero . )
