i guess
i was attracted to this film
both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor ,
so i gave it a chance 
from director gregor jordan
( buffalo soldier ) .
basically ned kelly
( heath ledger )
is set up by the police 
especially superintendent franci hare
( geoffrey rush ) ,
he is forced to go on the run
forming a gang
and go against them to clear his own and his family 's name .
that is really all i can say about the story ,
as i was not paying the fullest attention
to be honest .
also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne 
naomi watts as julia cook 
laurence kinlan as dan kelly 
philip barantini as steve hart 
joel edgerton as aaron sherritt 
kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick 
kerry condon as kate kelly 
emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffith as susan scott .
ledger makes a pretty good performance ,
for what it is worth ,
and the film does have it is eye-catching moment 
particularly with a gun battle towards the end ,
but i can not say
i enjoyed it
as i did not look at it all .
okay !
