my husband and i just got done watching this movie .
i was not expecting it to be this good !
i was really astonished at how great the story line was .
i am usually very good at figuring out twisty plot ...
but this one had me .
i loved it !
i am going to have to watch it again
before i take it back .
i might even have to buy it .
: )
